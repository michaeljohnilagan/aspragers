There is a noticeable knowledge vacuum on the ways in which autism interacts with the difficulties associated with aging, even though in recent decades there has been a growing recognition of the different needs and experiences of those on the autistic spectrum. Importantly, experiences across earlier life stages such as youth and young adulthood also influence later outcomes and warrant consideration within this dynamic trajectory, meaning the ongoing and evolving developmental path individuals follow throughout life.
40690320		[Quantitative analysis of autism online forums].	Psychiatria Hungarica : A Magyar Pszichiatriai Tarsasag tudomanyos folyoirata	2025	Brigitta Kakuszi, Szilvia Hetesy, Pál Czobor		Social media platforms are becoming increasingly popular for discussing health-related topics. Our research focused on analyzing autism-related posts on the Reddit platform, including the r/autism, r/aspergers, and r/AutismIn - Women subreddits. We employed multiple approaches in our investigation: we conducted word frequency and sentiment analysis, defined symptom-based categories, and explored their interrelations. For the analyses, we used machine learning models in a Python environment, including BERT and DistilRoBERTa. Final statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4. Our findings indicate that the discussions primarily focus on challenges related to emotional regulation, social relationships, and sensory issues. In the textual data analysis, emotional expressions prominently featured fear beyond the neutral category, while expressions of joy were less prevalent. The results of our study highlight the distinctive characteristics of online conversations about autism. These insights can help professionals and healthcare providers better understand the everyday challenges and needs of individuals with autism, enabling them to offer more effective and targeted support.
40637642	doi: 10.5152/TurkArchPediatr.2025.25127	The Work of Grunya Efimovna Sukhareva in the Field of Autism Spectrum Disorder One Hundred Years After Her Original Description.	Turkish archives of pediatrics	2025	Annio Posar, Paola Visconti	IRCCS Istituto delle Scienze Neurologiche di Bologna, UOSI Disturbi dello Spettro Autistico, Bologna, Italia.	"Despite several articles that in recent years have highlighted the work of the Russian child psychiatrist and researcher Grunya Efimovna Sukhareva (Kiev, 1891 - Moscow, 1981), even today the prevailing opinion, at least in the Western world, does not attribute to this author the merit of the original clinical description of autism spectrum disorder. In fact, this credit is still attributed today first to Leo Kanner and second to Hans Asperger, who in 1943 and 1944 respectively described some cases of children who today would certainly be diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. In reality, almost 20 years earlier than Kanner and Asperger, that is in 1925, Sukhareva published a paper in which she described with great accuracy and in a modern way the cases of 6 children affected, using current terminology, by autism spectrum disorder, that today would be defined as ""high-functioning."" Later, in 1927, Sukhareva described 5 girls affected, emphasizing the sex-related differences in autistic features, which today represent a very current and still debated topic. Over the next few decades, her work remained largely unknown to most of the Western scientific world. In this paper, the intention is to pay tribute to Sukhareva's work in particular (but not only) in the field of autism and discuss some possible hypotheses as to why it has been ignored by most for decades."

Predicting functional outcomes following endovascular treatment (EVT) for large-vessel occlusion stroke (LVOS) is challenging. Some patients achieve functional independence (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0 -2) at 90 days despite being dependent at discharge, termed delayed functional independence (DFI), while others lose independence after discharge, termed delayed functional dependence (DFD). This study explores patterns and predictors of DFI and DFD in LVOS patients undergoing EVT.

Autism was introduced by Eugen Bleuler in 1910 as a defining feature of schizophrenia, and it remained so for 80 years. However, the concept was borrowed by Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger to describe another condition (infantile autism) and eventually awareness of autistic features in schizophrenia declined. Today, autistic features are by default considered indicative of autism spectrum disorder, and patients with schizophrenia, who exhibit autistic features, risk being misdiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and receiving inadequate treatment. To aid differential diagnosis and treatment, it is important to rediscover what autism in schizophrenia is, and how it differs from autism spectrum disorder. We present a reading of the seminal works that shaped the understanding of autism in schizophrenia and extract four key insights: autistic features are common in schizophrenia; autistic features are found both in behaviours and experiences; autism in schizophrenia can be defined as a frail immersion in the lifeworld, manifesting as a pervasive inability to take for granted what others consider matter of fact; and autism is hypothesised to be caused by self-disorder. Contemporary psychopathological research corroborates the idea that autism is caused by self-disorder, a concept that could substantially aid differential diagnostic resources.
40439995	doi: 10.1007/s10728-025-00527-0	History of the Autism Diagnosis- How the Perspectives Have Changed.	Health care analysis : HCA : journal of health philosophy and policy	2025	Heldi Marleen Lang	University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia. heldi.marleen.lang@ut.ee.	The diagnosis and perception of autism have undergone significant transformations throughout history. Initially conceptualised as a symptom of schizophrenia, autism later emerged as a distinct diagnosis, evolving into the broader classification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This essay explores the main shifts in the understanding of autism throughout its history and different approaches to its treatment. While the traditional psychiatric perspective aligns with a naturalist view of disease, the Neurodiversity Movement advocates for a normative approach, emphasising societal adaptation over medical intervention. The study examines historical milestones, including the contributions of Eugen Bleuler, Grunya Sukhareva, Leo Kanner, and Hans Asperger, alongside the conceptual transition from low- and high-functioning autism to the spectrum model. It also discusses the implications of language in shaping autism discourse, highlighting the shift from person-first to identity-first terminology. The essay ultimately argues that the expansion of the autism diagnosis supports the neurodiversity paradigm, which fosters greater inclusion and empowerment of neurodivergent individuals. However, considerations of severity and linguistic framing remain crucial in advancing this perspective.

Frontiers in psychiatry	2025	Ilaria Traetta, Ilaria Gabbatore, Alessandra Aimar, Giuseppe Maurizio Arduino, Francesca M Bosco	Department of Humanities, Research Group on Inferential Processes in Social Interaction (GIPSI) Research Group, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. Centro Riabilitazione Ferrero, Alba, Italy. Centro Autismo e Sindrome di Asperger ASL CN1, Mondovì, Italy. Department of Psychology, Research Group on Inferential Processes in Social Interaction (GIPSI) Research Group, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication. Autistic individuals who are verbally fluent, often show difficulties in pragmatic ability, i.e. the capacity to use language and other expressive means, as gestures or the tone of the voice, to convey meaning in a given context. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of various technologies such as videoconferencing and internet for the delivery of healthcare services, i.e. telehealth, has proven to be effective, accessible and safe tools for remote healthcare. However, there are few tools to assess pragmatic skills in telehealth. This study investigates the effectiveness of the telehealth-adapted Assessment Battery for Communication (e-ABaCo), a clinical tool previously validated for in-person assessments, to evaluate pragmatic abilities in autistic individuals. We expect a substantial equivalence in performance for the administration of the adapted version of e-ABaCo compared to the face-to-face one.

Living with undiagnosed autism may have negative consequences for mental health, including increased risk of self-harm and suicidal behaviours. Autism is currently underdiagnosed in adult females. While severe self-harm is associated with complex psychopathologies, it is often assumed to signify the presence of borderline personality disorder, and underlying autism may not be recognised. The purpose of the current study was to explore the prevalence of diagnosed autism, as well as the prevalence of being screen positive for autism and its clinical correlates, in a clinical sample of inpatients with severe self-harm.

Frambu Resource Centre for Rare Disorders, Sandbakkvn 18, 1404, Siggerud, Norway.	Siblings of children with chronic disorders are at risk of developing mental health problems. Studies are inconclusive about whether sibling mental health is best predicted by the specific diagnoses of the child with disorder or by transdiagnostic factors. The aims of the present study were (1) to examine if specific diagnoses predicted sibling mental health, and (2) to examine if disorder severity in the child with the chronic disorder predicted sibling mental health. Baseline data from a randomized controlled trial were used. Siblings (aged 8 - 16 years) of children with chronic disorders and their parents were recruited from eight municipality and hospital clinics (N = 288). The children with chronic disorders were placed in ICD-10 diagnostic categories based on combined parent report and clinical records. Regression analyses with the most frequent primary diagnoses (ADHD, Asperger syndrome, autism, down syndrome, rare disorders) and a measure of disorder severity as predictors of sibling mental health were run. Father-reported disorder severity predicted sibling-reported internalizing problems and father-reported internalizing and externalizing problems in siblings. Mother-reported disorder severity predicted mother-reported sibling internalizing problems. No single primary diagnosis predicted sibling internalizing or externalizing problems. Disorder severity does to an extent predict sibling mental health, whereas single diagnostic categories do not. Disorder severity may be used to identify siblings at risk and/or in need of interventions. Fathers should be included in assessment and health care for siblings as their reports seem to predict sibling mental health better than the mothers.
39948076	pii: 5401	Prognosis and quality of life in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer after abdominoperineal resection in the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 randomized phase 3 trial.	Scientific reports	2025			Low anterior resection (LAR) and abdominoperineal resection (APR) are the two main surgical procedures after preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for locally advanced rectal cancer. APR is associated with poorer prognosis; however existing data do not consider intensified CRT (5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)/Oxaliplatin + radiation) protocols. Clinicopathological data of patients treated with APR and LAR from the CAO/ARO/AIO-04 trial were analysed in terms of prognostic parameters and quality of life (QoL). Based on higher response rate after intensified CRT, subgroup analyses were performed. Data from n = 1173 patients were assessed. APR after preoperative CRT was associated with a significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.0056), disease-free survival (p < 0.0001) and local recurrence rate (p = 0.0047). Clinicopathological data including clinical T stage (p < 0.000001), grading (p = 0.0038), postoperative lymph node (LN) positivity (p = 0.013), and number of positive LN (p = 0.0049) significantly differed between procedures and showed higher values in APR patients. The quality of total mesorectal excision (TME) was significantly better (p < 0.0001) and complete resection rates were higher (p = 0.0022) in LAR compared to APR patients. Subgroup analyses showed worse LR rates in APR patients after standard CRT (5-FU mono and radiation) but not after intensified CRT. After 3 years, role functioning (p = 0.019) and physical functioning (p = 0.001) had a slightly poorer outcome in APR patients. The poorer prognosis of patients undergoing APR for locally advanced rectal cancer may be explained by clinicopathological characteristics. Intensified CRT may compensate for the higher risk of LR after APR in patients with worse TME quality. QoL in APR patients was comparable to LAR patients.

A 29-year-old Spanish Caucasian man, without relevant family history, was attended in our unit due to an undiagnosed skeletal dysplasia associated with low bone mass and several fragility fractures throughout his childhood and adolescence. DXA exams throughout his life showed very low BMD values; currently, his spinal and femoral neck T-scores were - 4.3 and - 3.5, respectively. Blood and urinary tests were normal. Other relevant features included right hand and foot syndactyly, aplasia cutis, right hemibody hypoplasia, vertebral malformations, abnormal-looking humerii, and Asperger's syndrome among others. Whole exome sequencing retrieved a highly probable pathogenic variant in the PORCN gene p.(Arg296Pro) in mosaicism. PORCN mutations cause focal dermal hypoplasia (FDH), an X-linked ultra-rare ecto-mesodermal disorder characterized by several of the findings the patient presented. However, low BMD has not been classically associated with the disease. Noteworthy, PORCN is key for canonical Wnt signaling. Literature scrutiny has yielded other cases of FDH with skeletal fragility during childhood. In addition, preclinical studies with PORCN inhibitors, currently under development as an antitumoral therapy, have shown rapid detrimental effects on bone mass. Collectively, these findings indicate that FDH is probably an underrecognized monogenic cause of low bone mass due to defective Wnt signaling.

This study aims to outline the establishment of an autism registry program in the East Azerbaijan province of Iran, delineate its components, present the initial descriptive analysis results of the registered cases, and outline potential opportunities for further utilization of registry data. The children and adolescents of age ⩽18 years, who met the Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or Fifth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for autism spectrum disorder, were eligible for inclusion in the autism spectrum disorder registry program. A total of 1120 cases were registered from January 2015 to December 2023. The majority of the participants were male (81.60%), diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder between the ages of 3 and 7 years (41.90%), born through cesarean delivery (73.56%), and received their primary diagnosis from a psychiatrist (85.49%). According to the Fourth Edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, approximately 83% of the cases were diagnosed with autistic disorder, 3% with Asperger's disorder, and 13% with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. The autism spectrum disorder registry has the potential to contribute significantly to the development of effective policies for diagnosis and treatment services. By linking children's clinical and treatment data, it can help shape healthcare policies and services on a broader scale.Lay abstractThe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) registry program presents a unique opportunity to facilitate advanced research in various aspects of ASD, particularly in low-resource countries like Iran. Given the international significance of autism research, registry programs play a critical role in data sharing. ASD registry programs have been effectively established in high-income countries over a few decades; however, there are limited examples from low- and middle-income countries. This study presents a firsthand description of the design and primary findings of a 9-year established ASD registry program from the northwest of Iran. It elucidates the program's feasibility for other low-income settings, providing valuable insights for researchers and policymakers.

Brain sciences	2024	Patricia Recio, Pilar Pozo, Cristina García-López, Encarnación Sarriá	IMIENS: Joint Research Institute UNED-Health Institute Carlos III, 28029 Madrid, Spain. Department of Methodology of Behavioral Sciences, Faculty of Psychology, National University for Distance Education (UNED), 28040 Madrid, Spain.	Autistic adults exhibit core and comorbid features that can have an impact on their daily functioning and lead to considerable psychological distress. Significant and consistent associations have been identified between autism characteristics-restricted repetitive behaviors and sensory features-and high levels of stress and anxiety. For a better understanding of the issue, it is necessary to consider the cognitive aspects that can help explain variations in stress and anxiety levels among adults with autism. We therefore aimed to model the contributions of worry and intolerance of uncertainty on the relationship between autism characteristics (sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors) and psychological distress (stress and anxiety).

Child	2024	Javier Pérez-Flores, Irene Torralvo-Suárez, Antonieta Nieto	School of Psychology, University of La Laguna, La Laguna, Spain.	This study evaluates the neuropsychological profiles of three adolescent females with suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The study was conducted at My Blue Side, a support organization in Southern Tenerife. The research included a detailed assessment using standardized neuropsychological tests to identify the neuropsychological characteristics associated with ASD in adolescent females. The primary objective was to delineate the neuropsychological profile of each participant and its relationship with their daily functioning. Three participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment incorporating the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), the Autonomous Scale for the Detection of Asperger Syndrome and High-Functioning Autism, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V), the D2 test, Five-Digit Test (FDT), Spain-Complutense Verbal Learning Test (TAVCI), Rey Complex Figure (RCF) and Executive Functioning Questionnaire (EFECO). The study design aimed to provide a thorough understanding of each participant's neuropsychological profile and its potential impact on their daily functioning. The results indicated significant ASD markers across the participants, with substantial variability in neuropsychological capabilities, particularly in working memory and executive functioning. These deficits impacted daily functioning and emotional regulation. The assessments also highlighted challenges in verbal and visual learning, as well as difficulties with spontaneous recall. These findings underscore the need for interventions to consider these neuropsychological characteristics and their relationship with the daily challenges faced by females with ASD and their families, beyond the core symptoms of the disorder.

The diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is undergoing significant revisions, impacting prevalence estimates in the general population. Moreover, the rise of a dimensional perspective on psychopathology has broadened our understanding of autism, recognizing that subthreshold autistic features extend throughout the general population. However, there remains a limited understanding of the prevalence of ASD traits in individuals with psychiatric disorders, particularly in young adults, who are at an age where several mental health conditions emerge. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of ASD traits in a sample of young adults (18-24 years old) attending a generalized mental health outpatient clinic.

This study examined the presence of autistic traits in a sample of adult women diagnosed with different Eating Disorders (ED), and explored the concurrent role of autistic traits and sensory sensitivity in influencing both their eating disorder symptomatology and their autism-related eating behaviours. Seventy-five women with different ED (Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge-Eating Disorder, Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder) completed the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), the Autism Quotient (AQ), the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R), the Sensory Perception Quotient - Short Form 35 item (SPQ-SF35) and the Swedish Eating Assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorders (SWEAA). Twelve percent of participants scored above the cut-off on both the AQ and the RAADS-R, while 68% scored above the cut-off on the RAADS-R only. A mediation analysis revealed that the association between sensory sensitivity (SPQ-SFR35) and scores on both the EAT-26 and the SWEAA was significantly mediated by the presence of autistic traits (RAADS-R). These findings, first, confirm the presence of autistic traits in individuals with ED; second, they show that a lower sensory threshold (i.e., a higher sensory sensitivity) is associated with a higher presence of autistic traits which were, in turn, positively associated with dysfunctional eating behaviours typical of ED and ASD. This study ultimately highlights the importance of further research on autistic traits across all diagnostic categories of ED.

The Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) demonstrated excellent results in its original study, with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% (Ritvo et al. in J Autism Dev Disord 41:1076-1089, 2011). As a result, it was included in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines (Recommendations | Autism spectrum disorder in adults: diagnosis and management | Guidance | NICE, 2022). The questionnaire includes 80 questions across four subcategories (language, social relatedness, circumscribed interests, sensory motor). So far, the subcategory sensory motor has not been addressed in most available instruments, despite being part of the diagnostic criteria specified in DSM-5 (Falkai et al., in Diagnostisches Und Statistisches Manual Psychischer Störungen DSM-5. Hogrefe, 2015) and ICD-11 (ICD-11 for Mortality and Morbidity Statistics, 2022). In our validation study, we tested a translated German version of the questionnaire in 299 individuals (110 persons with ASD according to ICD-10 F84.0, F84.5, 64 persons with an primary mental disorders (PMD), 125 persons with no disorders). To enhance the practical use of the instrument in clinical everyday practice, the questionnaire was completed by the participants without the presence of a clinician-unlike the original study. Psychiatric diagnoses were established following the highest standards, and psychometric properties were calculated using established protocols. The German version of the RADS-R yielded very good results, with a high sensitivity of 92.5% and a high specificity of 93.6%. The area under the curve (AUC = 0.976), indicates a high quality and discriminatory power of RADS-R. Furthermore, the ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal threshold to distinguish between the ASD and non-ASD groups in the German version of the RAADS-R is a score of 81. In comparison to the RADS-R, the co-administered instruments Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and Empathy Quotient (EQ) each showed slightly better specificity but worse sensitivity in this sample.The study included individuals already diagnosed with ASD according to ICD-10 (F84.0, F84.5), with or without an primary mental disorders, preventing us from identifying the influence of comorbidities on the RADS-R results. In addition, a self-report questionnaire has generally only limited objectivity and may allow for false representation of the symptoms. The RADS-R compares well with other questionnaires and can provide valuable additional information. It could turn out to be a helpful diagnostic tool for patients in Germany. We propose naming the German version RADS-R (Ritvo Autism Diagnostic Scale - rRevised) to reflect the change in terminology.

Institute of Health Sciences, Jan Kochanowski University, Al. IX Wiekow Kielc 19A, 25-516 Kielce, Poland.	The etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has not yet been completely elucidated. Through time, multiple attempts have been made to uncover the causes of ASD. Different theories have been proposed, such as being caused by alterations in the gut-brain axis with an emphasis on gut dysbiosis, post-vaccine complications, and genetic or even autoimmune causes. In this review, we present data covering the main streams that focus on ASD etiology. Data collection occurred in many countries covering ethnically diverse subjects. Moreover, we aimed to show how the progress in genetic techniques influences the explanation of medical White Papers in the ASD area. There is no single evidence-based pathway that results in symptoms of ASD. Patient management has constantly only been symptomatic, and there is no ASD screening apart from symptom-based diagnosis and parent-mediated interventions. Multigene sequencing or epigenetic alterations hold promise in solving the disjointed molecular puzzle. Further research is needed, especially in the field of biogenetics and metabolomic aspects, because young children constitute the patient group most affected by ASD. In summary, to date, molecular research has confirmed multigene dysfunction as the causative factor of ASD, the multigene model with metabolomic influence would explain the heterogeneity in ASD, and it is proposed that ion channel dysfunction could play a core role in ASD pathogenesis.

Frontiers in neuroscience	2024	Shan Wang, Zhe Sun, Laura Alejandra Martinez-Tejada, Natsue Yoshimura	Department of Information and Communications Engineering, School of Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan. Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan. Department of Computer Science, School of Computing, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a series of neurodevelopmental disorders that may affect a patient's social, behavioral, and communication abilities. As a typical mental illness, ASD is not a single disorder. ASD is often divided into subtypes, such as autism, Asperger's, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Studying the differences among brain networks of the subtypes has great significance for the diagnosis and treatment of ASD. To date, many studies have analyzed the brain activity of ASD as a single mental disorder, whereas few have focused on its subtypes. To address this problem, we explored whether indices derived from functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data exhibited significant dissimilarities between subtypes. Utilizing a brain pattern feature extraction method from fMRI based on tensor decomposition, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and its fractional values of fMRI, and gray matter volume derived from MRI, impairments of function in the subcortical network and default mode network of autism were found to lead to major differences from the other two subtypes. Our results provide a systematic comparison of the three common ASD subtypes, which may provide evidence for the discrimination between ASD subtypes.

Alterations of the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis have been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). DGBI are highly prevalent in autistic children and are associated with worsening behaviour and anxiety. Treatments such as probiotics, prebiotics and gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) have shown efficacy in improving gut symptoms in children. The primary objective of the study was to compare changes in gastrointestinal (GI) scores following a 12-week intervention of synbiotics (prebiotic + probiotic) +/- GDH with a follow-up at 24 weeks. Secondary objectives included changes in behavioural and anxiety symptoms, while changes in gut microbiome composition were assessed as an exploratory objective. Children diagnosed with ASD aged 5.00-10.99 years (n = 40) were recruited and randomised (1:1) to a 12-week intervention of either synbiotics (SYN group) or synbiotics + GDH (COM group). Both the SYN and COM group experienced significant reductions in total GI scores post-intervention and at follow-up (p < 0.001), with no superiority of the COM treatment over the SYN treatment. The COM group showed beneficial reductions in anxiety scores (p = 0.002) and irritability behaviours (p < 0.001) which were not present in the SYN group. At follow-up, only those in the COM group maintained significant reductions in GI pain scores (p < 0.001). There were significant changes in gut microbiota such as increases in Bifidobacterium animalis and Dialister in both groups over time. In conclusion, synbiotics with or without GDH may help support standard care for autistic children who suffer comorbid DGBI. The trial was prospectively registered at clinicialtrials.gov on 16 November 2020 (NCTO4639141).

Autism, or autism spectrum disorders, is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by limitations in social interaction, communication skills, and repetitive behaviors. Although motor disorders were previously considered marginal in autism, recent research has highlighted their significance. Numerous studies have underscored the positive impact of sports on autistic individuals. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the literature regarding the effects of sport interventions on autistic individuals and aims to extract general and practical recommendations. Initially, the article reviews the various characteristics of autism that are positively impacted by sports, ranging from psycho-social skills to motor behavior. Subsequently, it examines how different configurations of sports practice (individual/collective, indoor/outdoor, etc.) may be suitable for autistic individuals. Literature research was conducted in two databases, resulting in the inclusion of 92 articles meeting longitudinal criteria (i.e., containing full sport/physical activity programs with pre-to-post analyses) out of 1665 initially identified articles. The findings suggest that individuals with autism can benefit from sports across a wide range of physical, psychological, and social factors. Importantly, there is no full contraindication for any activity, although some may require specific step-by-step preparation. Each activity has the potential to provide benefits in specific areas, as discussed in the article. In conclusion, further research is needed to explore the most effective strategies for implementing sports programs and maximizing their benefits for individuals across the autism spectrum.

Patil Medical College, Hospital and Research Center, Dr. D.Y. Patil Vidyapeeth (Deemed to be University), Pune, IND.	Background Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) encompass intricate interactions among genetic, brain, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes. These disorders, which are influenced by hereditary and environmental factors, impair personal, social, intellectual, or occupational functioning. Typically emerging early in life, NDDs include conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), vision and hearing impairments, motor disorders, and specific learning disabilities. Children from impoverished and low-income neighborhoods are particularly vulnerable. The lack of comprehensive health data and public awareness about these conditions results in limited information regarding the prevalence of neurological illnesses in developing countries. India, with its large and ethnically diverse population, exemplifies this gap. Methods It is a prospective study to detect the prevalence and risk factors of neurodevelopmental disorders in children aged six months to nine years at a tertiary care center. Patient details, clinical findings, and relevant history were recorded on a pre-designed pro forma and analyzed statistically. Results Among the 1000 children in the study, 91 (9.1%) tested positive for NDDs. Among the 91 children who tested positive for NDD, the highest frequency is in the three to four years age group (17.6%), males were found to be in a higher ratio with 75.82%, with the male: female ratio being 3:1. Among the 91 children with NDD, intellectual disability was the most common disorder (20.9%), followed by ADHD (17.6%) and vision impairment (14.3%). Autism spectrum disorders, including autism and Asperger syndrome, and communication disorders, including stuttering and speech disorders, accounted for 13.2% each. Hearing loss was seen in 9.9% of children and multiple disorders were seen in 8.8% of the children from among 91 children. Conclusion Neurodevelopmental disorders are common and often coexist with other conditions. Children from low-income backgrounds are more affected. This study provides valuable insights into the prevalence and characteristics of NDDs in a specific population.

39057190	pii: 70	Evaluating Large Language Models' Ability Using a Psychiatric Screening Tool Based on Metaphor and Sarcasm Scenarios.	Journal of Intelligence	2024	Hiromu Yakura	Max-Planck Institute for Human Development, 14195 Berlin, Germany.	Metaphors and sarcasm are precious fruits of our highly evolved social communication skills. However, children with the condition then known as Asperger syndrome are known to have difficulties in comprehending sarcasm, even if they possess adequate verbal IQs for understanding metaphors. Accordingly, researchers had employed a screening test that assesses metaphor and sarcasm comprehension to distinguish Asperger syndrome from other conditions with similar external behaviors (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This study employs a standardized test to evaluate recent large language models' (LLMs) understanding of nuanced human communication. The results indicate improved metaphor comprehension with increased model parameters; however, no similar improvement was observed for sarcasm comprehension. Considering that a human's ability to grasp sarcasm has been associated with the amygdala, a pivotal cerebral region for emotional learning, a distinctive strategy for training LLMs would be imperative to imbue them with the ability in a cognitively grounded manner.

Journal of forensic sciences	2024	Muhammed Emin Boylu, İlker Taşdemir, Mehmet Doğan, Tuba Özcanlı	Expertise Department of Psychiatric Observation, Council of Forensic Medicine, Ministry of Justice, İstanbul, Turkey.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by marked differences in communication patterns, reciprocal social interactions, and restricted, stereotyped, and repetitive interests and activities. Various behavioral problems in ASD, more so when accompanied by coexisting psychopathology, can sometimes lead to legal problems. In this study, the cases in which an opinion was requested in terms of criminal responsibility with the diagnosis of ASD in the 5-year period between 2018 and 2022 in the expertise department of psychiatric observation, where psychiatric cases were hospitalized and observed in the Council of Forensic Medicine (CFM), which is the official expert institution in Türkiye, were retrospectively evaluated. The mean age of the group whose criminal responsibility was reduced or removed was 22.9 years (±7.52) and the mean IQ score was 76.63 ± 18.94. The most common crime in this group was intentional injury (5/11), and it is noteworthy that the victims of these crimes were usually relatives of people with ASD (5/6). The criminal acts of people with ASD are usually single-movement, spontaneous, unplanned, impulsive acts. In addition, although there is no problem in cognitive perception in people with high functioning ASD (HF-ASD), various forensic situations may arise due to defects in emotional awareness. When we look at the practices of the CFM in Türkiye, it is seen that in cases where the diagnosis of ASD is clear and can be associated with the crime, criminal responsibility is usually completely eliminated. In HF-ASD types, although it is important to be associated with the crime, it is seen that criminal responsibility is generally reduced.

Department of Psychiatry, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA. Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous condition that affects development and functioning from infancy through adulthood. Efforts to parse the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum through subgroups such as Asperger's and Profound Autism have been controversial, and have consistently struggled with issues of reliability, validity, and interpretability. Nonetheless, methods for successfully identifying clinically meaningful subgroups within autism are needed to ensure that research, interventions, and services address the range of needs experienced by autistic individuals. The purpose of this study was to generate and test whether a simple set of questions, organized in a flowchart, could be used in clinical practice and research to differentiate meaningful subgroups based on individuals' level of functioning. Once generated, subgroups could also be compared to the recently proposed administrative category of Profound Autism and to groupings based on standardized adaptive measures. Ninety-seven adults with autism or related neurodevelopmental disorders participating in a longstanding longitudinal study, or their caregivers if they could not answer for themselves, completed phone interviews when the participants were ~30 years old. Information from these phone interviews was used to generate vignettes summarizing characteristics and aspects of the daily lives of each participant (e.g., language level, vocational activities, and social relationships). Three expert clinicians then used these vignettes to classify each participant based on their level of support needs. Meaningfully distinct subgroups within the sample were identified which could be reliably distinguished from one another. Implications of such categorizations and future directions are discussed.

Mesomelia-Synostoses Syndrome (MSS)(OMIM 600,383) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by mesomelic limb shortening, acral synostoses and multiple congenital malformations which is described as a contiguous deletion syndrome involving the two genes SULF1 and SLCO5A1. The study of apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements (BCRs) is a cytogenetic strategy used to identify candidate genes associated with Mendelian diseases or abnormal phenotypes. With the improved development of genomic technologies, new methods refine this search, allowing better delineation of breakpoints as well as more accurate genotype-phenotype correlation.

Valid and reliable developmental screening and assessment tools allow professionals to identify disabilities/delays in children, enabling timely intervention to limit adverse lifelong impacts on health. However, differences in child development related to culture, genetics, and perinatal outcomes may impact tool applicability. This study evaluated the validity, reliability, and accessibility of multidomain developmental screening tools for young children, analyzed the applicability of tools across different contexts, and created a compendium of tools. Employing adapted realist review methods, we searched APA PsycInfo, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, and Google to identify relevant articles and information. We assessed accessibility, validity, reliability, and contextual applicability (N = 4110 evidence sources) to create tool ratings and make recommendations. Of 33 identified tools, 22 were screening and 11 were assessment tools. Fewer screening tools than assessment tools were rated highly overall. Evidence for use in different cultures was often lacking for both types of tools. The ASQ (screening) and BDI (assessment) tools were rated most favorably and are recommended for use, though other tools may be more applicable in different contexts (e.g., NEPSY among children with Asperger's Syndrome).

Indian journal of psychological medicine	2024	Karishma Godara, Vaibhav Patil, Nisha Phakey	Dept. of Clinical Psychology, Amity University, Punjab, India. National Drug-Dependence Treatment Centre and Dept. of Psychiatry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. Dept. of Psychiatry & NDDTC, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.	Being a typically developing sibling to a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD-Sib) can be associated with several behavioral and mental health problems. With this understanding, researchers are beginning to focus on sibling-oriented interventions. This review seeks to evaluate the current literature on such interventions. We searched digital databases and identified eight relevant studies. The sample (n = 247) had an age range of 4-16 years. The outcomes were generally positive, with improvements in different facets of ASD-Sibs. Results differed due to varied intervention styles, outcome variables, methods, and samples. Our findings highlight the potential for improvement in ASD-Sib's knowledge of autism and their psychological functioning and hence call for further research with robust methods.

A scoping review on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and its impact on the families of affected children was undertaken due to insufficient information available on the diverse experiences impacting their lives. Using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology, eligibility criteria were guided by Population (families), Concept (family experiences), and Context (African region). English-language articles were sought from a variety of databases and search engines. The publication date of the identified articles ranged from 2003 to 2021 with most published in 2020 (n = 10), and the majority using qualitative methodologies (n = 51). Most family members involved were parents (n = 51) and their ages ranged from 18 to 75 years. The families experienced various challenges related to their child with regard to education, healthcare, and the broader community including lack of support. Family coping strategies included believing in God, attending counseling sessions, adapting, and accepting the situation. Healthcare professionals should be prepared and positioned to educate families and siblings on various aspects of ASD. There is a need for active, continued research on families within most countries of World Health Organization Afro-region.

After his 1944 thesis, Asperger continued to write about autism, but none of these texts have been translated. At a time when autism spectrum disorder faces many challenges (e.g. the nature and measurement of autism), this text tells us more about the particular population that Asperger worked with. He describes sensitive, intelligent, creative and rational children, a far cry from the Wing triad. Moreover, 'Asperger's Syndrome' was introduced after he had died, was included in the DSM-IV in 1994 and was omitted from the DSM-5 in 2013. The question posed by this last text, written before his death, is whether Asperger's descriptions of autistic children are really part of the autism spectrum disorder or whether they are outside the pathological field.

Laboratory of Molecular Neurology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes autism, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder. Individuals with ASD may exhibit difficulties in social interactions, communication challenges, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. While genetic mutations in individuals with ASD can either activate or inactivate the activities of the gene product, impacting neuronal morphogenesis and causing symptoms, the underlying mechanism remains to be fully established. Herein, for the first time, we report that genetically conserved Rac1 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Dock5 signalosome molecules control process elongation in the N1E-115 cell line, a model line capable of achieving neuronal morphological changes. The increased elongation phenotypes observed in ASD and intellectual disability (ID)-associated Semaphorin-5A (Sema5A) Arg676-to-Cys [p.R676C] were also mediated by Dock5 signalosome molecules. Indeed, knockdown of Dock5 using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CasRx-based guide(g)RNA specifically recovered the mutated Sema5A-induced increase in process elongation in cells. Knockdown of Elmo2, an adaptor molecule of Dock5, also exhibited similar recovery. Comparable results were obtained when transfecting the interaction region of Dock5 with Elmo2. The activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), one of the primary signal transduction molecules underlying process elongation, was ameliorated by either their knockdown or transfection. These results suggest that the Dock5 signalosome comprises abnormal signaling involved in the process elongation induced by ASD- and ID-associated Sema5A. These molecules could be added to the list of potential therapeutic target molecules for abnormal neuronal morphogenesis in ASD at the molecular and cellular levels.

In the last decades, growing caseness for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has been observed, owing to the diagnostic accretion of low-impairment forms, over and above other possible causes. Unrecognized ASD is likely to be mislabeled as a psychotic disorder (PD), as people in the spectrum may show 'pseudopsychotic' symptoms, resembling both negative and positive symptoms. On the other hand, PDs are likely to be overlooked when they arise in people with ASD, due to the 'diagnostic overshadowing' of new-onset conditions by lifelong core autistic symptoms. The three available metanalyses on the occurrence of psychosis in adults with ASD convergently reported a rate of PDs that is at least ten times higher than in the general population. Therefore, the lack of literature addressing risk factors, outcomes, and treatment options for psychosis in the context of ASD is utterly concerning. The present review aims to summarize up-to-date knowledge of PDs with comorbid ASD in terms of clinical features, course, and treatment.

Psychiatria polska	2023	Maciej Dul, Krzysztof Walczewski	Szpital Kliniczny im. dr Józefa Babińskiego w Krakowie.	"In this article, we present the case of an adult patient, whose main problem is episodes of fantasizing and rocking lasting up to 12 hours a day and completely preventing school development. The nature of the disorder in the patient is related to the sinking into fantasies, and not typical obsessions as in OCD. The patient was previously treated with drugs from the SSRI group, neuroleptics (without aripiprazole) and methylphenidate. Only methylphenidate showed some improvement; however, it made the patient feel ‟stiff in thinking"". The patient was hospitalized because of a suicide attempt, which, as it later turned out, was self-harm with no intention of killing himself. During hospitalization, a differential diagnosis was performed and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made, which was accompanied by immersion in the world of one's fantasies and stereotypical behavior. The patient was administered aripiprazole at a dose of 15 mg/d and after three weeks, a significant improvement in health was achieved, including a reduction in the duration of episodes from several hours to several dozen seconds. The drug is well tolerated by the patient. The patient was discharged from the hospital and continues his school education. In the article, we present single case reports in which similar spectacular results were achieved in similar cases. We also describe a possible physiological explanation for this response to this drug."

38495338	pii: imag-1-00022	The impact of quality control on cortical morphometry comparisons in autism.	Imaging neuroscience (Cambridge, Mass.)	2023			Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality is known to impact and bias neuroanatomical estimates and downstream analysis, including case-control comparisons, and a growing body of work has demonstrated the importance of careful quality control (QC) and evaluated the impact of image and image-processing quality. However, the growing size of typical neuroimaging datasets presents an additional challenge to QC, which is typically extremely time and labour intensive. One of the most important aspects of MRI quality is the accuracy of processed outputs, which have been shown to impact estimated neurodevelopmental trajectories. Here, we evaluate whether the quality of surface reconstructions by FreeSurfer (one of the most widely used MRI processing pipelines) interacts with clinical and demographic factors. We present a tool, FSQC, that enables quick and efficient yet thorough assessment of outputs of the FreeSurfer processing pipeline. We validate our method against other existing QC metrics, including the automated FreeSurfer Euler number, two other manual ratings of raw image quality, and two popular automated QC methods. We show strikingly similar spatial patterns in the relationship between each QC measure and cortical thickness; relationships for cortical volume and surface area are largely consistent across metrics, though with some notable differences. We next demonstrate that thresholding by QC score attenuates but does not eliminate the impact of quality on cortical estimates. Finally, we explore different ways of controlling for quality when examining differences between autistic individuals and neurotypical controls in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset, demonstrating that inadequate control for quality can alter results of case-control comparisons.

This study aim to investigate common psychiatric and stress-related diagnoses, along with postviral fatigue, in individuals with prior stress-induced exhaustion disorder (SED) and prior depression compared to those without prior SED or depression, and to study whether the psychiatric comorbidity patterns differ. The study includes individuals in Region Stockholm who, in 2011, did not have a diagnosis of SED or depression. ICD-10 diagnosis of SED, depression, or both, recorded in 2012-2013, were compared to individuals without prior SED or depression in a cohort (n = 1,362,886), aged 18 to 65. Odds ratios (OR) with 99 % confidence intervals, adjusted for age and neighborhood socioeconomic status, were calculated for psychiatric disorders and post-viral fatigue in 2014-2022. Patients with prior SED showed associations primarily with stress related diagnoses, including acute stress reaction, reaction to severe stress, as well as post-COVID-19 and post-viral fatigue syndrome. These ORs were all larger for SED than depression. Depression was primarily associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol related and substance use disorders, schizophrenia, schizotypal disorders, delusional disorders, manic episode, bipolar affective disorder, persistent mood disorder, neurotic disorder, borderline personality disorder, autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, attention -deficit hyperactivity disorder, attention-deficit disorders ADHD/ADD), and suicide attempt. These ORs were all higher for depression, although autistic disorders, ADHD/ADD and PTSD were also highly associated with prior SED (OR > 3.5). The divergent psychiatric comorbidity patterns suggest different underlying mechanisms and clinical prognosis.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) microstates, which represent quasi-stable patterns of scalp topography, are a promising tool that has the temporal resolution to study atypical spatial and temporal networks in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While current literature suggests microstates are atypical in ASD, their clinical utility, i.e., relationship with the core behavioural characteristics of ASD, is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to examine microstate parameters in ASD, and examine the relationship between these parameters and core behavioural characteristics in ASD. We compared duration, occurrence, coverage, global explained variance percentage, global field power and spatial correlation of EEG microstates between autistic and neurotypical (NT) adults. Modified k-means cluster analysis was used on eyes-closed, resting state EEG from 30 ASD (10 females, 28.97 ± 9.34 years) and 30 age-equated NT (13 females, 29.33 ± 8.88 years) adults. Five optimal microstates, A to E, were selected to best represent the data. Five microstate maps explaining 80.44% of the NT and 78.44% of the ASD data were found. The ASD group was found to have atypical parameters of microstate A, C, D, and E. Of note, all parameters of microstate C in the ASD group were found to be significantly less than NT. While parameters of microstate D, and E were also found to significantly correlate with subscales of the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale - Revised (RAADS-R), these findings did not survive a Bonferroni Correction. These findings, in combination with previous findings, highlight the potential clinical utility of EEG microstates and indicate their potential value as a neurophysiologic marker that can be further studied.

Laboratory of Molecular Neurology, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that includes autism, Asperger's syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder. ASD is characterized by poor interpersonal relationships and strong attachment. The correlations between activated or inactivated gene products, which occur as a result of genetic mutations affecting neurons in ASD patients, and ASD symptoms are now of critical concern. Here, for the first time, we describe the process in which that the respective ASD-associated mutations (Arg676-to-Cys [R676C] and Ser951-to-Cys [S951C]) of semaphorin-5A (Sema5A) localize Sema5A proteins themselves around the plasma membrane in the N1E-115 cell line, a model line that can achieve neuronal morphological differentiation. The expression of each mutated construct resulted in the promotion of excessive elongation of neurite-like processes with increased differentiation protein markers; R676C was more effective than S951C. The differentiated phenotypes were very partially neutralized by an antibody, against Plexin-B3 as the specific Sema5A receptor, suggesting that the effects of Sema5A act in an autocrine manner. R676C greatly increased the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), one of the signaling molecules underlying process elongation. In contrast, the blocking of JNK signaling, by a chemical JNK inhibitor or an inhibitory construct of the interaction of RhoG with Elmo1 as JNK upstream signaling molecules, recovered the excessive process elongation. These results suggest that ASD-associated mutations of Sema5A, acting through the JNK signaling cascade, lead to excessive differentiated phenotypes, and the inhibition of JNK signaling recovers them, revealing possible therapeutic targets for recovering the potential molecular and cellular phenotypes underlying certain ASD symptoms.

Institute of Occupational Science & Rehabilitation, Metropolitan College, 151 25 Athens, Greece.	Individuals with High-Functioning Autism present impairments in communication, social interaction, and motor development. A low level of motor skills, namely difficulties in gross and fine mobility, and in motor control, discourage individuals with High-Functioning Autism from being involved in physical activities, resulting in fewer opportunities for social interaction. There is not much evidence available about the effects of regular swimming exercise and/or aquatic therapy on health promotion in adults with High-Functioning Autism. An adult male (22 yrs) diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism participated in a combined 6-month swimming and aquatic therapy program (two sessions/week, 60 min each). The pre- and post-intervention assessments consisted of physical fitness, balance, functional ability, and psychomotor tests. The post-intervention assessments showed improvements in the standing long jump (+100%), hand grip force (+71.7%), bend arm hang test (+123.1%), and the physiological parameters in the 6 min walk test (+10.2%). On the opposite, decrements in the sit-up (-12%) and sit-and-reach test (-6.3%) were observed. It was noted that the participant frequently lost interest and focus quickly, resulting in the abandonment of the exercise. Conclusively, there is a great need for further research on this topic examining a larger adult population.

"The relationship between Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD), considering the dimensions of narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability, represents an important differential diagnosis and potential ground of comorbidity, since both conditions show high grades of pervasiveness, a life-long course, ego-syntonic traits, and difficulties in building up and sustaining interpersonal relationships Although the co-diagnosis rates, according to the categorical criteria in use, are limited (0%-6.4%), it is common to encounter diagnostic doubts in clinical practice. Here we investigated the dimensions of narcissistic vulnerability and grandiosity in a sample of 87 adults diagnosed with ASD without intellectual disabilities through the administration of the Pathological Narcissism Inventory-52 Items (PNI-52). The mean scores of our sample were compared with the normative distribution available in the literature, and we found that individuals with ASD scored significantly higher than neurotypical controls at the Total Score and at the Vulnerable Narcissism subscale, but not at the Grandiose Narcissism subscales. Demographic features did not influence these results. Vulnerable narcissism was significantly associated with the ""Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale - Revised"" subscale Social Relatedness. These findings could potentially be indicative of a greater comorbidity rate between the two disorders with respect to the one reported to date, possibly because DSM-5 criteria are mainly focused on the grandiose dimension. Potential explanatory links between ASD phenomenology and vulnerable narcissism, such as the personality dimension of neuroticism, are discussed, together with the possible role of narcissistic vulnerability in mediating internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression) in individuals with ASD."

Frontiers in psychiatry	2023	Desiree R Jones, Noah J Sasson	Department of Psychology, School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, United States.	While stigma toward autistic individuals has been well documented, less is known about how autism is perceived relative to other stigmatized disabilities. As a highly stigmatized condition with similar social cognitive features to autism, schizophrenia may offer a useful comparison for stigma. Previous studies have found that autistic people may be perceived more favorably than those with schizophrenia, but little is known about the underlying volitional thoughts that contribute to differences in how these conditions are perceived.

Psychosocial stressors have been suggested to precipitate psychotic episodes in patients with pre-existing psychosis and otherwise healthy subjects. However, such a risk has never been formally investigated in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sixty-nine autistic adolescents hospitalized for psychotic/manic symptoms (PSY) and other mental health issues (NPSY) over a 9-year period were compared with reference to their previous exposure to psychosocial stressors. ASD diagnoses satisfied the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 criteria. Psychotic/manic symptom assessment followed the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS). Psychosocial stressor exposure was collected separately at each admission. Preliminarily, univariate between-group comparisons were conducted. Then, a binomial model was adopted to investigate associations with previous exposure to psychosocial stressors. Results were reported with a change in AIC (ΔAIC). PSY patients presented with higher previous exposure to adverse life events (30.43% vs. 6.52%, OR = 6.079 [1.209, 40.926], p = 0.013) and school/work difficulties (30.43% vs. 8.70%, OR = 4.478 [0.984, 23.846], p = 0.034) than NPSY ones. Admissions for psychotic/manic symptoms occurred more likely in the context of family disturbances (OR = 2.275 [1.045, 5.045], p = 0.030) and adverse life events (OR = 3.489 [1.194, 11.161], p = 0.014).

Subjects with Asperger's syndrome without intellectual disabilities have significant difficulties in establishing social relationships despite their IQ being within the normal range. One of the effects of social deficit is depression. The question arises whether loneliness and dimensions of meaning in life correlate with the severity of depression and whether the average severity of depression, loneliness and dimensions of meaning in life differentiate the following groups: people with Asperger's syndrome and depression, people with Asperger's syndrome without depression, people with depression without Asperger's syndrome and healthy subjects. The study was conducted on a total of 170 people, including: 43 people with Asperger's syndrome and depression, 41 people with Asperger's syndrome without depression, 40 people with depression without Asperger's syndrome and 46 healthy people (without Asperger's syndrome and without depression). All were administered a demographic survey, Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale, Life Attitude Profile-Revised. Asperger's syndrome and depressive episodes were diagnosed on the basis of ICD-10 research criteria still applicable in Poland. In the group with Asperger's syndrome and depression the highest levels of loneliness and the lowest values of the dimensions of the sense of meaning in life, except for the acceptance of death, were observed. This result was significantly different from the results obtained in the other study groups. Both in people with Asperger's syndrome without depression and in people with depression without Asperger's syndrome, the values of the dimensions of the sense of meaning in life and the level of loneliness differ significantly from the results obtained in the control group. The BDI-II scores correlated positively with the loneliness values and negatively with the sense of meaning in life values in all groups. The results indicate that both suffering from depression and having Asperger's syndrome are associated with an increased sense of loneliness and a reduced sense of meaning in life. People with Asperger's syndrome and depression have the highest values of loneliness and the lowest values of dimensions of the sense of meaning of life compared to the other groups studied. The limitation of the work is the deliberate selection of groups, because it would be interesting to answer the question whether Asperger's syndrome is a risk factor for depression in the population.

The Chinese Eyes Test showed good convergent and divergent validity, satisfactory known-group discrimination, and acceptable internal consistency. The identified cutoff score of 18 or below (Sensitivity: 66.7%; Specificity: 84.0%) should be useful for identifying clinically significant levels of social cognitive deficits, in terms of difficulty with the perceptual understanding of others' mental states, in high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger syndrome.

Autism spectrum disorder is made up of several disorders, which include autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder. Boys are four times more likely to be diagnosed than girls with autism spectrum disorder, and symptoms usually become apparent by the age of three. Autism spectrum disorders' core characteristic features are abnormal interaction, impairment in communication, and stereotyped behaviors with restricted activities and interests. There are also non-core features associated with autism spectrum disorder, and these are aggression, self-injurious behavior, and tantrums. To date, there is no one drug approved to treat the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, but antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone have been shown to be effective at treating both core and non-core symptoms in controlled trials using multiple behavioral rating scales such as the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist subscale, the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale, the Ritvo-Freeman Real Life Scale, the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale, the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, and the Social Withdrawal Subscale. The safety, efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of risperidone were assessed in these studies, and weight gain was a common side effect observed, but the outcome was usually mild and self-limiting. The effect of risperidone on cognition was explored in this article. The studies selected for this article were of small sample size and short duration, which presented limitations for treatment with risperidone and an area that needs to be explored further for its contribution to clinical practice.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that persists into adulthood with both social and cognitive disturbances. Asperger's syndrome (AS) was a distinguished subcategory of autism in the DSM-IV-TR defined by specific symptoms including difficulties in social interactions, inflexible thinking patterns, and repetitive behaviour without any delay in language or cognitive development. Studying the functional brain organization of individuals with these specific symptoms may help to better understand Autism spectrum symptoms.

Subungual lesions present a serious challenge for clinicians. The following factors can cause certain problems in interpreting the data: 1) Changes in lesion morphology over time: It may indicate the presence of a malignant lesion (increased pigmentation over time and lack of distal growth) but may actually be a benign lesion (chronic persistent subungual hematoma). 2) Patient's medical history can be misleading or difficult to verify, especially in problematic patients, or those with mental health problems or communication disorders (e.g., Asperger's syndrome, autism, schizoid psychosis, etc.). 3) The morphology of the lesion itself can be difficult to determine in the presence of simultaneously overlapping lesions. These patient dilemmas primarily concern the differentiation between subungual hematomas from subungual melanomas. The clinicians's concerns are based on the potential for metastasis and the risk of significantly worse prognosis for patients affected by nail biopsy. We present a 19-year-old patient with a subungual pigmented lesion with a clinical/dermatoscopic suspicion for subungual melanoma. Primary complaints for about 3-4 months. Intensified pigmentation and increase in size within two months led to a partial surgical resection of the nail plate and nail bed, followed by adaptation of the wound edges with single interrupted sutures. The histopathological finding was indicative of a subungual hematoma located above a focal melanocytic hyperplasia of the nail bed, clear resection lines. After a literature review, we believe that this is the first case of a patient with simultaneously present subungual benign focal melanocytic hyperplasia overlapping with a chronic persistent subungual hematoma.

Pharmaceuticals are present in various waters and can be almost completely rejected by membrane separation processes, i.e., nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Nevertheless, the adsorption of pharmaceuticals can decrease their rejection, so adsorption can be considered a very important removal mechanism. In order to increase the lifetime of the membranes, the adsorbed pharmaceuticals must be cleaned from the membrane. The used pharmaceutical (albendazole), the most common anthelmintic for threatening worms, has been shown to adsorb to the membrane (solute-membrane adsorption). In this paper, which is a novelty, commercially available cleaning reagents, NaOH/EDTA solution, and methanol (20%, 50%, and ≥99.6%) were used for pharmaceutical cleaning (desorption) of the NF/RO membranes used. The effectiveness of the cleaning was verified by Fourier-transform infrared spectra of the membranes. Of all the chemical cleaning reagents used, pure methanol was the only cleaning reagent that removed albendazole from the membranes.

Basic and clinical neuroscience	2022	Farnaz Faridi, Afrooz Seyedebrahimi, Reza Khosrowabadi	Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.	Autism is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder associated with social, cognitive and behavioral impairments. These impairments are often reported along with alteration of the brain structure such as abnormal changes in the grey matter (GM) density. However, it is not yet clear whether these changes could be used to differentiate various subtypes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Peripheral nerve tumors of the median nerve are uncommon. We present a case of a large atypical intraneural perineurioma of the median nerve. In our case, a 27-year-old man with a history of Asperger's and Autism who was diagnosed with a lipofibromatous hamartoma of the median nerve after a biopsy and treated conservatively presented to clinic due to the slowly growing size of his lesion. He was treated with excision of the lesion with associated resection of healthy median nerve and extensor indicis pollicis oppponenplasty. The pathology of the excision reported the lesion as an intraneural perineurioma instead of a lipofibromatous hamartoma perhaps presenting evidence of a reactive process.

Frontiers in neuroscience	2023	Shanshan Wu, Jiali Fan, Fajuan Tang, Lin Chen, Xiaoyan Zhang, Dongqiong Xiao, Xihong Li	Emergency Department, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.	There are many special sites at the end of a synapse called active zones (AZs). Synaptic vesicles (SVs) fuse with presynaptic membranes at these sites, and this fusion is an important step in neurotransmitter release. The cytomatrix in the active zone (CAZ) is made up of proteins such as the regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis protein (RIM), RIM-binding proteins (RIM-BPs), ELKS/CAST, Bassoon/Piccolo, Liprin-α, and Munc13-1. RIM is a scaffold protein that interacts with CAZ proteins and presynaptic functional components to affect the docking, priming, and fusion of SVs. RIM is believed to play an important role in regulating the release of neurotransmitters (NTs). In addition, abnormal expression of RIM has been detected in many diseases, such as retinal diseases, Asperger's syndrome (AS), and degenerative scoliosis. Therefore, we believe that studying the molecular structure of RIM and its role in neurotransmitter release will help to clarify the molecular mechanism of neurotransmitter release and identify targets for the diagnosis and treatment of the aforementioned diseases.

Translational Research Center, University Hospital of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Bern, Switzerland.	Deficits in socio-emotional reciprocity, in prosocial behavior and in developing social relationships are diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), usually assessed by self-report or observation. Simple social experiments developed by behavioral economists allow for quantification of ASD-related social behavior. In this study, we used such experiments to compare social-economic decision-making between ASD adolescents and neurotypical controls. Precisely, we analyzed social orienting and prosocial behavior in 17 adolescents with ASD (Asperger syndrome) and 24 matched neurotypical adolescents. We used a two-condition distribution game (possibility of punishment by fellow player versus no such possibility) and an impunity game to examine social orienting (distribution game) and prosocial behavior (both games). Participants with ASD exhibited less social orienting in the distribution game (p = 0.03, d = -0.61). In addition, there was a trend for ASD participants to behave in a more prosocial way than neurotypical participants in the impunity game (p = 0.08, d = 0.60), which was not the case in the no-punishment condition of the distribution game (p = 0.35, r = 0.17). These results demonstrate the potential of simple economic games to capture reduced social orienting in ASD. The unexpected finding of more prosocial behavior in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder than in neurotypical controls adds to the complexity of previously published results. We recommend meta-analytic efforts to determine average effect sizes across studies and elucidate the conditions for prosocial behavior in ASD to occur.

Department of Statistics and Epidemiology, School of Public Health. School of Medicine. Department of Psychiatry.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are the two most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorders affecting communication and behavior. The co-occurrence of these conditions is probable and can contribute to several challenges in adaptive functioning and academic achievement.In this cross-sectional study, 168 Iranian medical students (107 female, 61 male) studying at Tehran University of Medical Sciences in 2021 were enrolled. We administered the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) and Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) questionnaires online to assess different symptoms of ASD and ADHD in our sample. In this study, the RAADS-R was translated into Persian and validated for the first time in Iran.The correlation tests demonstrated a significant association between the total score and different subscales' scores of the RAADS-R and the total score and the two subscales' scores of the ASRS questionnaire ( p < 0.001, 0.27 < Spearman correlation coefficient < 0.51). This study also illustrated a high prevalence of ASD and ADHD symptoms among the participants. Moreover, male respondents had a significantly higher prevalence of ASD symptoms (57.3% in males vs . 28.03% in females, p < 0.001).This study indicated that the distinct impairments in behavior and cognition attributed to ASD and ADHD could be common manifestations in medical students. Given that the co-occurrence of these disorders may lead to significant challenges in their professional life, the early diagnosis and subsequent support for medical students with co-occurring expressions of ASD and ADHD could be extremely helpful, as it could indirectly improve the medical services provided to patients by future physicians, leading to an improvement in public health.

Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders and are considered multifactorial diseases with both genetic and environmental components. Epigenetic dysregulation driven by adverse environmental factors has recently been documented in neurodevelopmental disorders as the possible etiological agent for their onset. However, most studies have focused on the epigenomes of the probands rather than on a possible epigenetic dysregulation arising in their mothers and influencing neurodevelopment during pregnancy. The aim of this research was to analyze the methylation profile of four well-known genes involved in neurodevelopment (

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a central nervous system (CNS) neurodevelopmental disorder that includes autism, pervasive developmental disorder, and Asperger's syndrome. ASD is characterized by repetitive behaviors and social communication deficits. ASD is thought to be a multifactorial disorder with a range of genetic and environmental factors/candidates. Among such factors is the rab2b gene, although it remains unclear how Rab2b itself is related to the CNS neuronal and glial developmental disorganization observed in ASD patients. Rab2 subfamily members regulate intracellular vesicle transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi body. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report that Rab2b positively regulates neuronal and glial cell morphological differentiation. Knockdown of Rab2b inhibited morphological changes in N1E-115 cells, which are often used as the neuronal cell differentiation model. These changes were accomplished with decreased expression levels of marker proteins in neuronal cells. Similar results were obtained for FBD-102b cells, which are used as the model of oligodendroglial cell morphological differentiation. In contrast, knockdown of Rab2a, which is another Rab2 family member not known to be associated with ASD, affected only oligodendroglial and not neuronal morphological changes. In contrast, treatment with hesperetin, a citrus flavonoid with various cellular protective effects, in cells recovered the defective morphological changes induced by Rab2b knockdown. These results suggest that knockdown of Rab2b inhibits differentiation in neuronal and glial cells and may be associated with pathological cellular phenotypes in ASD and that hesperetin can recover their phenotypes at the in vitro level at least.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one the most disabling developmental disorders, imposing an extremely high economic burden. Obtaining as accurate prevalence estimates as possible is crucial to guide governments in planning policies for identification and intervention for individuals with ASD and their relatives. The precision of prevalence estimates can be heightened by summative analyses of the data collected around the world. To that end, we conducted a three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis. A systematic search of the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from 2000 up to 13 July 2020 was performed, and reference lists of previous reviews and existing databases of prevalence studies were screened. Overall, 79 studies were included in the analysis of ASD and 59-in the analysis of previously existing relevant diagnoses: 30 for Autistic Disorder (AD), 15 for Asperger Syndrome (AS), and 14 for Atypical Autism (AA) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS); these research reports covered the period from 1994 to 2019. Pooled prevalence estimates were 0.72% (95% CI = 0.61-0.85) for ASD, 0.25% (95% CI = 0.18-0.33) for AD, 0.13% (95% CI = 0.07-0.20) for AS, and 0.18% (95% CI = 0.10-0.28) for the combined group of AA and PDD-NOS. Estimates were higher (1) for the studies that used records-review surveillance rather than other designs; (2) in North America compared with other geographical regions; and (3) in high-income compared with lower-income countries. The highest prevalence estimates were registered in the USA. There was an increase in autism prevalence estimates over time. The prevalence was also significantly higher for children aged between 6 and 12 years compared to children under the age of 5 and over the age of 13 years.

Asperger syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by general impairment in socialization, stereotypical behavior, defective adaptation to the social context usually without intellectual disability, and some high functioning areas related to memory and mathematics. Clinical criteria are not well defined and the etiology is heterogeneous and mostly unknown. Like in typical autism spectrum disorders (ASD), the genetic background plays a crucial role in AS, and often an almost mendelian segregation can be observed in some families. We performed a whole exome sequencing (WES) in three relatives of a family with vertical transmission of AS-ASD to identify variants in candidate genes segregating with the phenotype.

British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)	2023	Åsa Hedlund	PhD-student, Department of Caring Sciences, University of Gävle, Sweden.	Autism spectrum disorder is an increasing diagnosis on a global scale. Despite limitations related to the diagnosis, many people with autism are active in the workforce, often within the health care sector. It is reasonable to assume that some of those are nurses. There are very few examples of nurses with autism in the literature, mostly in non-scientific contexts, and that these mention both autism-related strengths and limitations at work. A conclusion is that research about nurses with autism is almost non-existent, and it is high time to conduct explorative research in this area. If employers are given the knowledge and the ability to support the needs of nurses with autism, it is likely to benefit the health of the individual nurse, the psychosocial working climate and patient safety.

The COVID-19 pandemic has fast-tracked interest in telehealth methods to guarantee the continuity of care of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Store-and-forward telehealth approaches offer the opportunity to facilitate timely screening of ASD, allowing parents to record videos of their child's behaviors, subsequently shared with clinicians that provide an assessment remotely. This study aimed to examine the psychometric properties of a new telehealth screening tool, the teleNIDA, administered in home settings for remote observation of early signs of ASD in toddlers aged 18-30 months. Results showed good psychometric properties of the teleNIDA, as compared to the gold standard in-person assessment, and the predictive validity on the diagnosis of ASD at 36 months was demonstrated. This study supports the teleNIDA as a promising level 2 screening tool for ASD able to speed up diagnostic and intervention processes.

The transition to adolescence may be a challenging time for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This developmental period is marked by increased social demands and increasing anxiety and depression symptoms for many individuals with autism. As both of these factors may compound social difficulties and impact friendship experiences, this study explored the relations among autism symptom severity, internalizing symptoms, and friendship experiences in boys with and without ASD (with IQ > 75). Results showed that internalizing symptoms predicted quantity of close friendships in the ASD group. Given the observed relationship between internalizing symptoms and friendship experiences, social skills intervention programs should address possible internalizing symptoms associated with establishing/maintaining social relationships and perceived friendship quality.

"The vast majority of research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) focuses on characterizing and addressing the social communication deficits and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior that constitute the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. Yet, a small but significant portion of individuals diagnosed with ASD exhibit exceptional cognitive abilities in one or more domains. These ""twice-exceptional"" individuals often have unique skills that enable them to make significant contributions to the workforce, while at the same time facing unique challenges during the transition to independent living due to a lack of services and broad public misperceptions regarding their condition. Here we review the current literature on cognitive divergence in ASD, focusing on cognitive theories, neural substrates, and clinical and societal implications for increasing understanding of this phenomenon."

Mental health could worsen in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, their parents could be more at risk for an increase in anxiety and depression symptomatology. This study aims to understand the adaptation and the psychosocial well-being in a sample of 16 males aged 10-21 years old with Asperger's syndrome after the quarantine for COVID-19 when they return to school and partially to their activities in September 2020. The adopted approach is multi-informant with a battery of questionnaires on psychological health and adaptation given by a secure online web data Qualtrics both to adolescents and also to their parents. Paralleling matched peers with typical developments were assessed by adopting the same methodology. The results evidenced several difficulties in psychological health in population with Asperger's syndrome, especially in anxiety and socialization. Adaptation is put in crisis, even if they reported a good comprehension and adoption of the right behaviors anti-COVID-19. Parents of children with Asperger's syndrome reported similar psychological difficulties and general health to those of the group of children typically developing. Some clinical indications could be discussed for psychologists who follow children and adolescents with Asperger's syndrome.

Recent studies have reported that strengths-based programs, leveraging autistic adolescents' abilities and interests, could improve their skills and facilitate social engagement. However, little is known about the long-term impact of strengths-based approaches. This study aimed to explore the long-term outcomes of community strengths-based programs designed to support autistic adolescents in developing interests and skills in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) and the factors influencing their participation in these programs. A repeated cross-sectional survey study over three years recruited 52 parents in 2018, 52 parents in 2019, and 38 parents in 2020. Results highlighted the positive impact of these programs on autistic adolescents' health and well-being, social relationships and interactions, self-confidence and self-esteem, sense of belonging, and activities and participation. Five key elements influencing participation included the enthusiasm of the participants, their self-perception, the approach of the programs, the learning environment, and the attitudes of the mentors. This study implies that strengths-based approaches to intervention and support for autistic adolescents in a supported environment are a social model solution that could potentially have positive participant outcomes. Findings from this study could provide a framework underpinning future strengths-based interventions.

Economics Area, IIM Ahmedabad, Ahmedabad, India, Science Policy Research Unit, Business School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK. Ahmedabad University, Ahmedabad, India.	Do movies reduce stigma, increasing healthcare product choices offered by firms? We provide causal evidence on this question in the context of Indian pharmaceutical markets. For unpacking these effects, we use an exogenous shock to the market due to the release of a Bollywood blockbuster movie - My Name is Khan (MNIK) where the protagonist, superstar Shahrukh Khan, suffers from Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Using a difference-in-differences design, we find a positive and statistically significant effect of MNIK (between 14% and 22% increase in variety sold and prescribed) on product differentiation and choices in the market for antipsychotic medicines used to clinically treat AS. Results are consistent using alternative controls, a placebo treatment-based test and with a variety of other robustness checks. Our findings document likely for the first-time, supply side responses to edutainment and suggests potential associated welfare effects in healthcare markets characterized by sticky demand. Implications for global health and public policy given worldwide concerns around a mental wellness epidemic with Covid-19 are discussed.

"(1) Background: Subthreshold autism is a sub-clinical pattern of autism spectrum disorder-like (ASD-like) traits, including poor social skills, cognitive rigidity, anxiety, and aloofness. These ASD-like traits are significantly more prevalent among parents and relatives of participants with autism; however, evidence suggests that subclinical autistic traits are not restricted to the family members of individuals with autism but rather are continuously distributed in the general population. Though the autistic subclinical form is perhaps prevalent among adults, little attention has been paid to the association between autistic traits and global functioning in adolescence. The aim of the present study is to investigate the subthreshold autism phenotype in adolescence and its relationship with arousal correlates, exploring gender differences emerging in the sample. (2) Methods: A sample of 725 students (293 males and 432 females; mean age 17.19) were recruited from three high schools in Southern Italy. They were assessed by the following instruments: Autism Spectrum Quotient, Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum, Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale 14, and Hyperarousal Scale. (3) Results: In males, significant direct correlations between all dimensions of arousal and all variables related to autistic traits emerged except for the correlations between the H-Scale ""Introspection score"", the AQ questionnaire ""Total score"" ("

Medical Education, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences, Wardha, IND.	A variant of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) known as Asperger syndrome (AS) is characterized by severe issues with interpersonal, verbal, and nonverbal communication as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and activities. Although there is no known cause for ASD, various genetic as well as non-genetic risk factors that may act either alone or in combination to induce ASD have been identified. The occurrence of ASD has been increasing worldwide. Co-occurring neuropsychological diseases are frequently present as well. The premise for diagnosis is the observation of abnormal conduct, with diagnostic criteria emphasizing limitations in social interaction and communication as well as constrained, repetitive behavioral patterns, activities, or hobbies. The degree of the illness and the presence of intellectual impairment have a significant impact on the prognosis. Like autism, Asperger's can neither be prevented nor treated. There is no specific medical therapy that can effectively cure all of the symptoms of autism. However, medications may be used as adjuvant therapy for maladaptive behaviors and co-occurring mental problems. The treatment aims to reduce core impairments, increase functional ability, and reduce harmful behaviors that could limit functional skills. It is crucial to provide proper care, establish supportive networks for individuals who are affected and their families, and use effective therapies to enhance functioning and results.

Danish medical journal	2022	Rizwan Parvaiz, Zainab Al-Sayegh, Peter Kristian Jacobsen, Ida-Marie Danielsen, Poul Videbech	Team for ADHD and Autism, Psychiatric Center Glostrup. Center for Neuropsychiatric Depression Research, Psychiatric Center Glostrup, Denmark.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adults is exhibiting an increase in prevalence, and a growing rate of referrals is observed from primary health professionals to specialised units. The heterogeneous clinical presentation and high prevalence of comorbidity seen in ASD challenges the case identification, emphasising the need for screening tools with a high validity and reliability. Previously, satisfactory psychometric properties of the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale - Revised (RAADS-R) have been demonstrated, and it is a widely used screening tool in Denmark. Nevertheless, a validation of a Danish version of the RAADS-R has not been performed in a Danish population. To evaluate its clinical relevance, we aim to test the psychometric properties of a Danish translation of the RAADS-R (RAADS-R-DK) in an adult population.

Changes in the brain's default mode network (DMN) in the resting state are closely related to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Module segmentation can effectively elucidate the neural mechanism of ASD and explore intra- and inter-network connections by means of the participation coefficient (PC). We used that resting-state fMRI data from 269 ASD patients and 340 healthy controls (HCs) in the current study. From the results, ASD subjects showed a significantly higher PC of the DMN than HC subjects. This difference was related to lower intra-module connections within the DMN and higher inter-network connections between the DMN and other networks. When the subjects were split into age groups, the results were verified in the 7-12- and 12-18-year-old age groups but not in the young adult group (18-25 years). When the subjects were divided according to different subtypes of ASD, the results were also observed in the classic autism and pervasive developmental disorder groups, but not in the Asperger disorder group. In conclusions, less developed network segregation in the DMN could be a valid biomarker for ASD. This provides network scientists with new insights into the intermodular connectivity configurations of complex networks from different dimensions in a systematic and comprehensive manner.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2024			Feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness data of a virtual adaptation of the WHO Caregiver Skills Training (CST; n = 25) were compared with those of a pilot RCT of CST delivered in person (n = 43) against treatment as usual (TAU; n = 43). Virtual CST was delivered with high levels of integrity, but received lower ratings in some caregiver- and facilitator-rated acceptability and feasibility dimensions. Qualitative analysis identified both benefits (flexibility, convenience, clinical usefulness) and challenges, (technological issues, distraction from family members, emotional distance). Virtual and in-person CST improved significantly more on caregiver competence than TAU; there were no other significant effects. Potential for use of virtual CST as a clinical response in contexts where in-person delivery is not possible is discussed.

To make decisions in mental health care, service users, clinicians, and administrators need to make sense of research findings. Unfortunately, study results are often presented as raw questionnaire scores at different time points and regression coefficients, which are difficult to interpret with regards to their clinical meaning. Other commonly reported treatment outcome indicators in clinical trials or meta-analyses do not convey whether a given change score would make a noticeable difference to service users. There is an urgent need to improve the interpretability and relevance of outcome indicators in youth mental health (aged 12-24 years), in which shared decision making and person-centred care are cornerstones of an ongoing global transformation of care. In this Personal View, we make a case for considering minimally important change (MIC) as a meaningful, accessible, and user-centred outcome indicator. We discuss what the MIC represents, how it is calculated, and how it can be implemented in dialogues between clinician and researcher, and between youth and clinician. We outline how use of the MIC could enhance reporting in clinical trials, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines, and measurement-based care. Finally, we identify current methodological challenges around estimating the MIC and areas for future research. Efforts to select outcome domains and valid measurement instruments that resonate with youth, families, and clinicians have increased in the past 5 years. In this context, now is the time to define demarcations of changes in outcome scores that are clinically relevant, and meaningful to youth and families. Through the use of MIC, youth-centred outcome measurement, analysis, and reporting would support youth-centred therapeutic decision making.

The idea of using drugs from the benzimidazole group as potential antitumor agents is becoming increasingly popular and widespread in research. However, their use as antiparasitics and in cancer treatment will increase their already recorded occurrence in the aquatic environment. In this study, the removal of the anthelmintic mebendazole from aqueous solution was investigated using nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes, adsorption on granular activated carbon (GAC), and photolytic degradation. The dense NF90 and reverse osmosis XLE membranes showed almost complete removal (>97.7%), while the NF270 membrane showed a large dependence of removal on initial concentration from 41.9% to 96.6%. Adsorption in the column resulted in complete removal of mebendazole at the highest GAC height used (40 cm) from the solution with the lowest concentration (1 mg/L). Photolytic degradation by artificial light for 2 and 12 h resulted in photodegradation of mebendazole in the range of 23.5−61.4%, forming a new degradation or transformation compound with an m/z ratio of 311. Mebendazole is a photosensitive drug whose photodegradation follows first-order kinetics and depends on the drug concentration. Toxicity was studied with Vibrio fischeri before and after photolysis, and showed a decrease in inhibition after 12 h.

Irish journal of psychological medicine	2022	N Crowley, H O'Connell, M Gervin	Psychology, HSE Dublin Mid Leinster, Bridge Street, Portlaoise, Laois, Tullamore R32 D525, Ireland.	Autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-developmental disability with multi-systemic impacts. Individuals with ASD without intellectual impairment (DSM-V) or Aspergers (DSM-IV) are often particularly vulnerable to mental health problems such as anxiety disorders including social phobia and generalised anxiety disorder, depressive disorders and psychosis. Adults with ASD without intellectual impairment suffer higher rates of physical and psychiatric morbidity, display a poorer ability to engage with treatment and have a lower chance of recovery compared with the general population. It is widely acknowledged that adults with suspected ASD without intellectual impairment and co-morbid mental health problems are often not best supported through adult mental health services and often require more tailored supports. This review seeks to (a) increase awareness in the area of undiagnosed cases of ASD without intellectual impairment in adult mental health settings and (b) highlights the importance of identifying this population more efficiently by referring to best practice guidelines. The value of future research to examine the benefit of having a team of specialist staff within adult mental health teams who have received ASD training and who are supported to work with the 'core difficulties' of ASD is discussed and a model for the same is proposed. It is proposed that a specialist team could form a 'hub' for the development of expertise in ASD, which when adequately resourced and funded could reach across an entire region, offering consultancy and diagnostic assessments and interventions.

Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), 80 Workman Way, Toronto, ON M6J 1H4, Canada.	Self-report measures are central in capturing young people's perspectives on mental health concerns and treatment outcomes. For children and adolescents to complete such measures meaningfully and independently, the reading difficulty must match their reading ability. Prior research suggests a frequent mismatch for mental health symptom measures. Similar analyses are lacking for measures of Quality of Life (QoL). We analysed the readability of 13 commonly used QoL self-report measures for children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years by computing five readability formulas and a mean reading age across formulas. Across measures, the mean reading age for item sets was 10.7 years (SD = 1.2). For almost two-thirds of the questionnaires, the required reading age exceeded the minimum age of the target group by at least one year, with an average discrepancy of 3.0 years (SD = 1.2). Questionnaires with matching reading ages primarily targeted adolescents. Our study suggests a frequent mismatch between the reading difficulty of QoL self-report measures for pre-adolescent children and this group's expected reading ability. Such discrepancies risk undermining the validity of measurement, especially where children also have learning or attention difficulties. Readability should be critically considered in measure development, as one aspect of the content validity of self-report measures for youth.

Oxytocin (OXT) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that is released from the posterior pituitary gland and at specific targets in the central nervous system (CNS). The prosocial effects of OXT acting in the CNS present it as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of aspects of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this article, we systematically review the functional MRI (fMRI) literature that reports task-state and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) studies of the neural effects of single or multiple dose intranasal OXT (IN-OXT) administration in individuals with ASD.

Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany. lukas.hecker@uniklinik-freiburg.de.	One of the great challenges in psychiatry is finding reliable biomarkers that may allow for more accurate diagnosis and treatment of patients. Neural variability received increasing attention in recent years as a potential biomarker. In the present explorative study we investigated temporal variability in visually evoked EEG activity in a cohort of 16 adult participants with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and 19 neurotypical (NT) controls. Participants performed a visual oddball task using fine and coarse checkerboard stimuli. We investigated various measures of neural variability and found effects on multiple time scales. (1) As opposed to the previous studies, we found reduced inter-trial variability in the AS group compared to NT. (2) This effect builds up over the entire course of a 5-min experiment and (3) seems to be based on smaller variability of neural background activity in AS compared to NTs. The here reported variability effects come with considerably large effect sizes, making them promising candidates for potentially reliable biomarkers in psychiatric diagnostics. The observed pattern of universality across different time scales and stimulation conditions indicates trait-like effects. Further research with a new and larger set of participants are thus needed to verify or falsify our findings.

To make possible the inclusion of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in mainstream settings, parental knowledge and attitudes towards the disorder play a key role between the home and the school setting. However, prior literature has not carried out an in-depth analysis of parents' knowledge about ASD and their attitudes toward the inclusion of children with this diagnosis. This study examined the parental attitudes towards inclusion and knowledge about ASD. Participants were parents of children with ASD (

Frontiers in psychology	2022	Sara Coelho, Sophia Marlene Bonatti, Elena Doering, Asena Paskaleva-Yankova, Achim Stephan	Department of Psychology and Cognitive Science, University of Trento, Rovereto, Italy.

While rationalists or Kantians have argued that moral agency is rooted in reason, sentimentalists or Humeans have ascribed its origin to empathic feelings. This debate between rationalists and sentimentalists still stands with respect to persons with mental disorders, such as individuals diagnosed with mild forms of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), without intellectual impairment. Individuals with ASD are typically regarded as moral agents, however their ability for empathy remains debated. The goal of this paper is to investigate the mechanisms of moral actions in people with ASD, by finding arguments for the origin of their moral actions, supporting either the sentimentalist or the rationalist view of the dispute. We propose to revisit the debate using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to study the autobiographies of individuals with High-Functioning Autism (HFA) and Asperger Syndrome (AS). While conducting the systematic analysis of 10 autobiographies, we re-examined both the rationalist and the sentimentalist positions, considering the links between empathic feelings and moral agency. The investigation of the temporal dimensions of emotional experiences, an aspect overlooked by previous research, indicated that individuals with ASD empathize with others, but in different ways as compared to neurotypicals. A relationship between emotional experience and the type of moral agency exhibited by individuals with forms of ASD was established. As a consequence, our analyses support the sentimentalist stance on moral action.

The study objective was to improve understanding of current services and practices for autistic adults and opportunities for improvement as part of the Autism Spectrum Disorder in the European Union (ASDEU) project. Separate survey versions were created for autistic adults, carers of autistic adults, and professionals in adult services. 2,009 persons responded to the survey and 1,085 (54%) of them completed at least one of the services sections: 469 autistic adults (65% female; 55% <35 years old), 441 carers of autistic adults (27% female; 6% <35 years old), 175 professionals in adult services (76% female; 67% in non-medical services). Top choices by autistic adults, carers or professionals for services best suiting their current needs were: residential services: ""help in own home"" (adults, carers of high independent adults, professionals), ""fulltime residential facility"" (carers of low independent adults); employment services: ""job mentors"" (adults, carers of high independent adults, professionals), ""Sheltered employment"" (carers of low independent adults); education services: ""support in regular education setting"" (all groups); financial services: financial support in lieu of employment (""Supplementary income for persons unable to have full employment"" for adults, ""full pension"" for carers of low independent adults) or to supplement employment earnings for carers of high independent adults and professionals; social services: ""behavior training"" (adults) and ""life skills training"" (carers and professionals). Waiting times for specific services were generally < 1 month or 1-3 months, except for residential services which could be up to 6 months; most professionals were uninformed of waiting times (>50% responded ""don't know""). Five of seven residential services features recommended for autistic adults were experienced by <50% of adults. The knowledge of good local services models that work well for autistic adults was generally low across all services areas. The variation in services experiences and perceptions reported by autistic adults, carers, or professionals underscore the need to query all groups for a complete picture of community services availability and needs. The results showed areas for potential improvement in autistic adult services delivery in the EU to achieve recommended standards."

"Next-generation sequencing techniques have accelerated the discovery of rare mutations responsible for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in genes involved in a large number of physiological processes, including the control of gene expression, chromatin remodeling, signaling pathways, synaptic scaffolding, neurotransmitter receptors, and lipid metabolism. Genetic diagnosis provides subjects with an explanation of the cause of their disorder. However, it does not, or at least does not yet, shed light on the psychopathological phenomena specific to the individual. It could be hypothesized that each physiological impact of a mutation corresponds to a specific psychopathological phenomenon of ASD, i.e., ""a psychopathological natural kind"".

Functional neurological disorders (FNDs) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) share common features in terms of deficits in emotion regulation and recognition, sensory sensitivity, proprioception and interoception. Nevertheless, few studies have assessed their overlap. We recruited 21 patients with FNDs, 30 individuals with ASDs without intellectual disabilities and 45 neurotypical adults (NA). Participants completed: the Autism Quotient (AQ); the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R); and a questionnaire assessing functional neurological symptoms (FNS). ASDs participants also completed the Sensory Perception Quotient-Short Form (SPQ-SF35), assessing sensory sensitivity. In the FNDs sample, no patient scored above the clinical cut-off at the AQ and the 19% scored above the cut-off at the RAADS-R, a prevalence similar to the one we found in NA (15.6%; both p > 0.05). The 86.7% of participants with ASDs reported at least one FNS, a prevalence significantly higher than the NA one (35.6%, p < 0.001). In the ASDs sample, tactile hypersensitivity was found to be a risk factor for functional weakness (OR = 0.74, p = 0.033) and paraesthesia (OR = 0.753, p = 0.019). In conclusions, FNDs individuals did not present autistic traits more than NA, but ASDs individuals presented a higher number of FNSs than NA; this rate was associated with higher sensory sensitivity, especially in the touch domain.

The Adult Autism Quotient (AQ), the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and the Relative's Questionnaire (RQ) were used as part of the Adult Asperger's Assessment (AAA) by a diagnostic service for adults without an intellectual disability with suspected autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This service is part of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Little is known about the utility of these structured questionnaires despite wide use in clinical practice. It was investigated whether the questionnaires could discriminate between individuals with and without a diagnosis of ASD. Receiver Operating Curve analysis showed good levels of sensitivity to detect a positive diagnosis, but the specificity to exclude those without a diagnosis was poor. A binary logistic regression showed that a combination of the questionnaires also showed limited diagnostic validity. These findings have clinical implications in reviewing the efficiency of the assessment process.

Findings of the fatty acid status of people with autism spectrum disorders have been incongruent perhaps because of the diversity of the condition. A cross-sectional design study was used to  investigated fatty acid levels and relationships between fatty acids, and cognition and behaviour in a homogenous group of children with autism spectrum disorder. Children with Asperger's syndrome (AS) /high functioning autism (n = 44) and healthy siblings (n = 17) were recruited from the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Centre for Children with Autism, Warsaw, Poland. In the AS group, plasma phosphatidylcholine 22:5n3 correlated positively with verbal (r = 0.357, p = 0.019) and full scale (r = 0.402, p = 0.008) IQs, red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 22:5n3 with verbal (r = 0.308, p = 0.044), performance (r = 0.304, p = 0.047) and full scale (r = 0.388, p = 0.011) IQs and red blood cell phosphatidylethanolamine 22:5n3 with verbal (r = 0.390, p = 0.010) and full scale (r = 0.370, p = 0.016) IQs. Whilst, plasma phosphatidycholine 20:5n3 (r = -0.395, p = 0.009), 22:6n3 (r = -0.402, p = 0.007) and total n3 fatty acids (r = -425, p = 0.005), red blood cell phosphatidlycholine 20:5n3 (r = -0.321, p = 0.036) and red blood cell phosphatidylethanolamine 20:5n3 (r = -0.317, p = 0.038), 22:6n3 (r = -0.297, p = 0.05) and total n3 fatty acids (r = -0.306, p = 0.046) correlated inversly with ADHD index. Similarly, inattention was negatively related with plasma phosphatidylcholine 22:6n3 (r = -0.335, p = 0.028), and total n3 fatty acids (r = -0.340, p = 0.026), oppositional with plasma phosphatidylcholine 18:3n3 (r = -0.333, p = 0.029), 20:5n3 (r = -0.365, p = 0.016), total n3 fatty acids (r = -0.293, p < 0.05), red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 18:3n3 (r = -0.337, p = 0.027) and red blood cell ethanolamine 18:3n3 (r = - 0.333, p = 0.029), 20:5n3 (r = -0.328, p = 0.032), 22:6n3 (r = 0.362, p = 0.017) and total n-3 fatty acids (r = -0.298, p < 0.05) and hyperactivity with plasma phosphatidylcholine 22:6n3 (r = -0.320, p = 0.039). In contrast, there were inverse correlations between red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 18:2n6 and performance (r = -0.358, p = 0.019) and full scale (r = -0.320, p = 0.039) IQs, and direct correlations between red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 22:4n6 (r = 0.339, p = 0.026) and 22:5n6 (r = 0.298, p < 0.05) and ADHD index, between red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 22:4n6 (r = 0.308, p = 0.044) and inattention, between plasma phosphatidylcholine 22:4n6 (r = 0.341, p = 0.025), red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 20:4n6 (r = 0.314, p = 0.041) and total n6 fatty acids (r = 0.336, p = 0.028) and oppositional and plasma phosphatidylcholine 20:3n6 (r = 0.362, p = 0.018) and red blood cell phosphatidylcholine 20:3n6 (r = 0.401, p = 0.009) and hyperactivity. The findings of the ethnically homogenous children with Asperger's syndrome/high functioning autism study revealed positive associations between 22:5n3 and cognition, and negative relationships between 20:5n3 and 22:6n3 and behavioural problem. In contrast, cognitive ability and behavioural problems were negatively and positively associated with n6 fatty acids. Further investigation is required to establish whether there a cause and effect relationship. Regardless, it would be prudent to ensure that children with the conditions have optimum n3 PUFA intake.

Review of randomized clinical trials.	Postepy psychiatrii neurologii	2022	Ewa Brzóska-Konkol, Barbara Remberk, Anna Papasz-Siemienuk	Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland.	The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased tenfold over the last 40 years and the World Health Organization (WHO) has placed it alongside other globally occurring common illnesses, such as cancer, cardiovascular disorders and diabetes. As there are yet no effective methods for treating ASD, the most frequently used therapeutic interventions are psychological, psychosocial, rehabilitation and developmental support, which in combination aim to support patients and their families. Early intervention improves the prognosis, but usually a cure is impossible. Patient's lives are often burdened with social difficulties in contact with their families, peers and in education, particularly when other disorders, diseases or intellectual impairment are present, leading to undesirable behaviours, including aggression or self-aggression. Aim of the study was to review the literature available, so as to determine the effectiveness of probiotics used for treating core and accompanying symptoms of autism in patients diagnosed with ASD, with a particular focus on children and adolescents.

Genes	2022	Stephen M Edelson	Autism Research Institute, San Diego, CA 92116, USA.	The current version of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) does not consider Asperger syndrome a diagnostic category. This study was undertaken to see if there is evidence that this diagnosis should be reinstated. An online survey was conducted to examine symptoms and behaviors associated with the current diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (DSM-V), and those associated with Asperger syndrome based on the previous version (DSM-IV-TR). The study also examined other characteristics historically associated with autism, as well as impairments often reported in infancy/young childhood and medical comorbidities frequently associated with autism. The sample included 251 individuals who had received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome and 1888 who were diagnosed with autism or ASD. Numerous similarities and differences were found between the two groups. The findings are discussed in relation to reestablishing Asperger syndrome as a valid diagnostic category as well as a subtype of ASD.

Sleep spindles are an element of the sleep microstructure observed on the EEG during the NREM sleep phase. Sleep spindles are associated to sleep stability functions as well as memory consolidation and optimization of different cognitive processes. On the other hand, Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a generalized developmental disorder in which cognitive and sleep disturbances have been described. In this study we analyzed different characteristics of sleep spindles in a group of children with AS and compared them with sleep spindles of a group of children with typical development paired by age; both groups ranged from 6 to 12 years of age and were all male. We observed a statistically significant decrease in sleep spindles intrinsic frequency in different brain regions in the AS group in relation to the typical development group. This finding could be due to immaturity in brain regions related to the integration of sleep spindles; and this immaturity could be related with cognitive aspects in these patients.

Fachbereich Neurologie, Kantonsspital Graubünden, Chur, Schweiz. abcGbR, Oberschleißheim, Deutschland. abc.gbr@t-online.de.	Because of a painful right-sided coxarthrosis a 57-year-old female patient underwent a cementless total arthroplasty under general anesthesia. Except for Asperger's syndrome and an occlusion of a vein in her left eye she stated no other diseases or complaints, especially no cardiac problems. Postoperatively she developed neurological symptoms of left-sided hemiparesis and hemihypesthesia. A cranial computer tomography was performed and a right-sided infarction of the thalamic region was found. A patent foramen ovale (PFO) and atrial septal aneurysm were detected 5 days later. The incidence of a PFO is given as 25% of the population. A paradoxical air embolism in the presence of a PFO is a feared complication in neurosurgical interventions in a semi-sitting or sitting position. Corpuscular emboli, such as bone, cement, fat or wound debris may be the reason for paradoxical embolisms in combination especially with partial or total hip replacement. The kind of embolism in the case described could not be clarified. Deep vein thrombosis or cardiac arrhythmia could be excluded. Therefore, it can be considered most likely that the operation site was the source of the embolism. The trigger for a paradoxical embolism is a reversal of the pressure difference between the right and left atria: normally the left atrial pressure exceeds the right atrial pressure by ca. 2-4 mm Hg, resulting possibly in a small clinically irrelevant left-to-right shunt. If the pulmonary arterial circulation is compromised and pulmonary vascular resistance increases, the pressure gradient between the left and right atria reverses and a right-to-left shunt can occur causing a paradoxical embolism. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) ventilation during anesthesia could be an important reason for a shunt reversal between the right and left atria and therefore favoring a paradoxical embolism but the pathophysiological role of PEEP has not yet been finally clarified.

Although intranasal oxytocin is expected to be a novel therapy for the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, which has currently no approved medication, the efficacy of repeated administrations was inconsistent, suggesting that the optimal dose for a single administration of oxytocin is not optimal for repeated administration. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, crossover trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03466671) was aimed to test the effect of TTA-121, a new formulation of intranasal oxytocin spray with an enhanced bioavailability (3.6 times higher than Syntocinon® spray, as assessed by area under the concentration-time curve in rabbit brains), which enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, on autism spectrum disorder core symptoms and to determine the dose-response relationship. Four-week administrations of TTA-121, at low dose once per day (3 U/day), low dose twice per day (6 U/day), high dose once per day (10 U/day), or high dose twice per day (20 U/day), and 4-week placebo were administered in a crossover manner. The primary outcome was the mean difference in the reciprocity score (range: 0-14, higher values represent worse outcomes) on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule between the baseline and end point of each administration period. This trial with two administration periods and eight groups was conducted at seven university hospitals in Japan, enrolling adult males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. Enrolment began from June 2018 and ended December 2019. Follow-up ended March 2020. Of 109 males with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder who were randomized, 103 completed the trial. The smallest P-value, judged as the dose-response relationship, was the contrast with the peak at TTA-121 6 U/day, with inverted U-shape for both the full analysis set (P = 0.182) and per protocol set (P = 0.073). The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule reciprocity score, the primary outcome, was reduced in the TTA-121 6 U/day administration period compared with the placebo (full analysis set: P = 0.118, mean difference = -0.5; 95% CI: -1.1 to 0.1; per protocol set: P = 0.012, mean difference = -0.8; 95% CI: -1.3 to -0.2). The per protocol set was the analysis target population, consisting of all full analysis set participants except those who deviated from the protocol. Most dropouts from the full analysis set to the per protocol set occurred because of poor adherence to the test drug (9 of 12 in the first period and 8 of 15 in the second period). None of the secondary clinical and behavioural outcomes were significantly improved with the TTA-121 compared with the placebo in the full analysis set. A novel intranasal spray of oxytocin with enhanced bioavailability enabled us to test a wide range of multiple doses, revealing an inverted U-shape dose-response curve, with the peak at a dose that was lower than expected from previous studies. The efficacy of TTA-121 shown in the current exploratory study should be verified in a future large-scale, parallel-group trial.

Catalan Institute for Water Research (ICRA-CERCA), C. Emili Grahit, 101, 17003 Girona, Spain.	Ultra-violet light-emitting diode (UV-LED)-based processes for water treatment have shown the potential to surpass the hurdles that prevent the adoption of photocatalysis at a large scale due to UV-LEDs' unique features and design flexibility. In this work, the degradation of five EU Watch List 2020/1161 pharmaceutical compounds was comprehensively investigated. Initially, the UV-A and UV-C photolytic and photocatalytic degradation of individual compounds and their mixtures were explored. A design of experiments (DoE) approach was used to quantify the effects of numerous variables on the compounds' degradation rate constant, total organic carbon abatement, and toxicity. The reaction mechanisms of UV-A photocatalysis were investigated by adding different radical scavengers to the mix. The influence of the initial pH was tested and a second DoE helped evaluate the impact of matrix constituents on degradation rates during UV-A photocatalysis. The results showed that each compound had widely different responses to each treatment/scenario, meaning that the optimized design will depend on matrix composition, target pollutant reactivity, and required effluent standards. Each situation should be analyzed individually with care. The levels of the electrical energy per order are still unfeasible for practical applications, but LEDs of lower wavelengths (UV-C) are now approaching UV-A performance levels.

Relatively little has been published about the prevalence of autism in adults with psychiatric disorders. In this study, all new patients referred to an adult psychiatric outpatient clinic in Sweden between November 2019 and October 2020 (n = 562) were screened for autism spectrum disorders using the Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale Screen (RAADS-14). Out of the 304 (58%) responders, 197 who scored above the cut off (14) were invited to participate in an in-depth assessment. Twenty-six of the 48 that participated in the assessment met criteria for ASD and an additional eight had subthreshold ASD symptoms. We estimated the prevalence of ASD in this population to at least 18.9%, with another 5-10% having subthreshold symptoms.

Frontiers in neuroscience	2021	Siyu Long, Rui Ding, Junce Wang, Yue Yu, Jing Lu, Dezhong Yao	MOE Key Lab for Neuroinformation, The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China.	Delta activity on electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered a biomarker of homeostatic sleep drive. Delta power is often associated with sleep duration and intensity. Here, we reviewed the literature to explore how sleep quality was influenced by changes in delta power. However, we found that both the decrease and increase in delta power could indicate a higher sleep quality due to the various factors below. First, the differences in changes in delta power in patients whose sleep quality is lower than that of the healthy controls may be related to the different diseases they suffered from. We found that the patients mainly suffered from borderline personality disorder, and Rett syndrome may have a higher delta power than healthy individuals. Meanwhile, patients who are affected by Asperger syndrome, respiratory failure, chronic fatigue, and post-traumatic stress disorder have lower delta power. Second, if the insomnia patients received the therapy, the difference may be caused by the treatment method. Cognitive or music therapy shows that a better therapeutic effect is associated with decreased delta power, whereas in drug treatment, there is an opposite change in delta power. Last, for healthy people, the difference in delta change may be related to sleep stages. The higher sleep quality is associated with increased delta power during the NREM period, whereas a deceased delta change accompanies higher sleep quality during the REM period. Our work summarizes the effect of changes in delta power on sleep quality and may positively impact the monitoring and intervention of sleep quality.

Perceived personal wellbeing tends to be lower in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), especially in the case of women. To develop the present study, the Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI-A) was administered to a Spanish-speaking sample of women with ASD (N = 401) and self-diagnosed ASD (N = 343), women without ASD (N = 373) and men with ASD (N = 65) to compare their self-perceptions. Women with ASD showed significantly lower wellbeing rates than women in the control group for the total PWI-A and across all the domains, and there were no significant differences when compared with self-diagnosed women with ASD and men with ASD. Autism explained between 24 and 26% of the decline in the PWI-A total score, with life achievement, future security, safety and relationships being the domains most highly correlated with the total. These findings are an effective contribution to improving diagnosis and professional intervention in women with ASD.

Department of Paediatrics & Education Research, Monash University, 246 Clayton Road, Clayton, Victoria, Australia. Alexandra.ure@monash.edu.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder defined by persistent deficits in social functioning and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs). RRBs refer to four subtypes of behaviour including repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects; insistence on sameness; restricted interests; and sensory processing abnormalities. Many individuals with ASD also experience anxiety, which compounds ASD-related difficulties and inhibits daily functioning. RRBs have been found to be positively associated with anxiety; however, our understanding of the interplay between RRB subtypes and anxiety remains unclear. Thus, the current review aims to clarify the association between RRBs and anxiety by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Autism is a developmental disorder that has significant consequences on the future of the individuals concerned. Officially described for the first time in the 1940's, the disorder knew conceptual oscillations, but increasingly it is considered a sort of spectrum or continuum characterized mainly by a difficulty in social communication. In this article we will show how two very different clinical types of the autistic spectrum, i.e. the clinical descriptions of Kanner and Asperger's, owe much to the role played by the Viennese psychiatrist Georg Frankl who worked with both clinicians. Frankl's role would not only have been that a sort of channel of communication between Kanner and Asperger, but it would have been Frankl who influenced both psychiatrists in a decisive way.

Language plays a major role in human behavior. For this reason, neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in which linguistic ability is impaired could have a big impact on the individual's social interaction and general wellbeing. Such disorders tend to have a strong genetic component, but most past studies examined mostly the linguistic overlaps across these disorders; investigations into their genetic overlaps are limited. The aim of this study was to assess the potential genetic overlap between language impairment and broader behavioral disorders employing methods capturing both common and rare genetic variants.

International journal of molecular sciences	2021	Kinga Gzielo, Agnieszka Nikiforuk	Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Department of Behavioral Neuroscience and Drug Development, 12 Smętna Street, 31-343 Kraków, Poland.	"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is an umbrella term encompassing several neurodevelopmental disorders such as Asperger syndrome or autism. It is characterised by the occurrence of distinct deficits in social behaviour and communication and repetitive patterns of behaviour. The symptoms may be of different intensity and may vary in types. Risk factors for ASD include disturbed brain homeostasis, genetic predispositions, or inflammation during the prenatal period caused by viruses or bacteria. The number of diagnosed cases is growing, but the main cause and mechanism leading to ASD is still uncertain. Recent findings from animal models and human cases highlight the contribution of glia to the ASD pathophysiology. It is known that glia cells are not only ""gluing"" neurons together but are key players participating in different processes crucial for proper brain functioning, including neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, inflammation, myelination, proper glutamate processing and many others. Despite the prerequisites for the involvement of glia in the processes related to the onset of autism, there are far too little data regarding the engagement of these cells in the development of ASD."
34761363	doi: 10.1007/7854_2021_269	Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy for Social Adaptability in Autistic Adults.	Current topics in behavioral neurosciences	2022	Alicia Danforth	The Lundquist Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA, USA. adanforth@lundquist.org.	Access to the Internet has upended long-standing myths and misconceptions about autism as autistic individuals are enabled through technology increasingly to influence the dialog around neurodiversity, the experience of being autistic, and the effectiveness of mental health interventions for autistic adults. Autistic self-advocates are speaking up in support of including neurodivergent adults as a population that might benefit from the burgeoning psychedelic medicine field, in an absence of many other mental health treatment options that have been researched and shown to be effective for them. Autism is a genetically-determined neurocognitive variant with considerable heterogeneity across the broad autistic phenotype spectrum. Therefore, enthusiasm for investigating psychedelics to cure or alter the course of autism is most likely ill-informed and misdirected; psychiatric and psychopharmacological interventions do not alter the genome. However, autism frequently co-occurs with clinical conditions such as anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and trauma that have been investigated as indications for clinical trials with classic and atypical psychedelics. The purpose of this chapter will be to inform researchers and clinicians on the history of clinical research with classic psychedelics with autistic minors, recent and current clinical trials of atypical psychedelics with autistic adults, and considerations for providing psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies that are compatible with autism.

Electronic address: karolin.krause@camh.ca. International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement, London, UK. Research Department for Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London, UK; Wellcome Trust, London, UK.	Mental health research grapples with research waste and stunted field progression caused by inconsistent outcome measurement across studies and clinical settings, which means there is no common language for considering findings. Although recognising that no gold standard measures exist and that all existing measures are flawed in one way or another, anxiety and depression research is spearheading a common metrics movement to harmonise measurement, with several initiatives over the past 5 years recommending the consistent use of specific scales to allow read-across of measurements between studies. For this approach to flourish, however, common metrics must be acceptable and adaptable to a range of contexts and populations, and global access should be as easy and affordable as possible, including in low-income countries. Within a measurement landscape dominated by fixed proprietary measures and with competing views of what should be measured, achieving this goal poses a range of challenges. In this Personal View, we consider tensions between affordability, sustainability, consistency, and adaptability that, if not addressed, risk undermining the common metrics agenda. We outline a three-pronged way forward that involves funders taking more direct responsibility for measure development and dissemination; a move towards managing measure dissemination and adaptation via open-access measure hubs; and transitioning from fixed questionnaires to item banks. We argue that now is the time to start thinking of mental health metrics as 21st century tools to be co-owned and co-created by the mental health community, with support from dedicated infrastructure, coordinating bodies, and funders.

Department of Psychiatry, Warneford Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 7JX, UK. david.sher@psych.ox.ac.uk.	Grunya Efimovna Sukhareva's seminal role in being the first to publish a clinical description of autistic traits in 1925, before both Kanner and Asperger, has been revealed relatively recently. Nevertheless, Sukhareva's work is little known and largely unrecognised beyond Russia. Amidst calls for greater recognition of her pivotal contribution in the genesis of autism conceptualisation and categorisation, this article provides a biographical and historical background. Sukhareva's wide-ranging psychiatric work is adumbrated and her pioneering efforts in conceptualising both schizophrenia and autism are elucidated. The article reflects on possible explanations for the belated and incomplete recognition of Sukhareva's role. The current article indicates how Sukhareva's work was ahead of its time in reflecting modern criteria for autism diagnoses and in its focus on female case studies. Sukhareva's somewhat precarious position as a foremost psychiatrist condemned in the Stalinist years for being anti-Marxist is explicated. The article outlines further directions for academic research on Sukhareva's work and contributions.

Autism research and treatment	2021	Sarah L Jones, Maria Johnson, Bronwen Alty, Marios Adamou	University of Hudderfield, Huddersfield, UK. South West Yorkshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, Wakefield, UK.	Adult referrals to specialist autism spectrum disorder diagnostic services have increased in recent years, placing strain on existing services. It was proposed that the Ritvo Autism Asperger's Diagnostic Scale could be used as a screening tool, in order to identify and prioritise patients most likely to receive an ASD diagnosis. This study evaluates the validity of the RAADS-R as a screening tool for ASD in an adult population. Retrospective case note analysis was used to evaluate the efficacy of the RAADS-R as a screening tool to predict ASD diagnostic outcomes in 50 service users of a NHS specialist autism service. Results indicate no association between RAADS-R scores and clinical diagnostic outcome, suggesting the RAADS-R is not an effective screening tool for identifying service users most likely to receive an ASD diagnosis. In conclusion, used as a self-report measure pre-full diagnostic assessment, the RAADS-R lacks predictive validity and is not a suitable screening tool for adults awaiting autism assessments. Future research should aim to identify reliable screening tools for this purpose.

"We assessed the reliability and validity of the Turkish version of the autism spectrum quotient (AQ)-adolescent. Three assessment groups of adolescents, aged 11-18, were: 80 with Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism (AS/HFA), 71 with other psychiatric disorders (PDs; 35 major depression, 18 obsessive-compulsive disorder, 18 social phobia), and 249 healthy controls. The scores of the AS/HFA group were significantly higher than the healthy control and PD groups. Cronbach α value was 0.829. Ordinal alpha value was 0.90. We showed the AQ-adolescent four-factor structure in the factor analysis. In the test-retest of AQ-adolescent and subscale scores, ""very strong"" significant correlation values were detected. A cut-off score of 24 best distinguished the autism group from healthy controls with 0.975 sensitivity and 0.991 specificity."

Frontiers in psychology	2021	Katharina Krämer, Annekatrin Vetter, Ulrich Schultz-Venrath, Kai Vogeley, Sophia Reul	Private Practice for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Cologne, Germany. Department of Psychiatry, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.	In order to successfully interact with others in social encounters, we have to be attentive to their mental states. This means, we have to implicitly and explicitly interpret our own actions as well as the actions of others as meaningful on the basis of the ascription of intentional mental states. However, this ability, often referred to as mentalizing, seems to be impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Individuals with ADS show specific deficits relating to the representation of mental states of others. Especially, the spontaneous, intuitive attribution of and reaction to others' mental states seem to be impaired. Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT) is a form of psychotherapy in individual and group settings that focuses on the education and enhancement of mentalizing. Although the scope of MBT is broad and MBT has been already proven to be useful in a variety of mental disorders, no attempt has been made to apply MBT in patients with ASD. In our study, we adapted MBT for adults with ASD in a therapeutic group setting to examine the feasibility as well as the effectiveness of the treatment in this patient group. During 15-20 weeks of weekly group therapy, we surveyed the patients' acceptability of the intervention. Additionally, changes in mentalizing difficulties were measured before and after treatment. Results show a high acceptance of the treatment and an improvement in the patients' mentalizing abilities, presenting MBT as a promising treatment option for ASD.
34450699	pii: 5256	Identification of Autism Subtypes Based on Wavelet Coherence of BOLD FMRI Signals Using Convolutional Neural Network.	Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)	2021	Mohammed Isam Al-Hiyali, Norashikin Yahya, Ibrahima Faye, Ahmed Faeq Hussein	Centre for Intelligent Signal and Imaging Research (CISIR), Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Seri Iskandar 32610, Perak, Malaysia. Biomedical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad 10072, Iraq.	The functional connectivity (FC) patterns of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) play an essential role in the development of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) classification models. There are available methods in literature that have used FC patterns as inputs for binary classification models, but the results barely reach an accuracy of 80%. Additionally, the generalizability across multiple sites of the models has not been investigated. Due to the lack of ASD subtypes identification model, the multi-class classification is proposed in the present study. This study aims to develop automated identification of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subtypes using convolutional neural networks (CNN) using dynamic FC as its inputs. The rs-fMRI dataset used in this study consists of 144 individuals from 8 independent sites, labeled based on three ASD subtypes, namely autistic disorder (ASD), Asperger's disorder (APD), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals from 116 brain nodes of automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas are used, where the top-ranked node is determined based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the power spectral density (PSD) values. Based on the statistical analysis of the PSD values of 3-level ASD and normal control (NC), putamen_R is obtained as the top-ranked node and used for the wavelet coherence computation. With good resolution in time and frequency domain, scalograms of wavelet coherence between the top-ranked node and the rest of the nodes are used as dynamic FC feature input to the convolutional neural networks (CNN). The dynamic FC patterns of wavelet coherence scalogram represent phase synchronization between the pairs of BOLD signals. Classification algorithms are developed using CNN and the wavelet coherence scalograms for binary and multi-class identification were trained and tested using cross-validation and leave-one-out techniques. Results of binary classification (ASD vs. NC) and multi-class classification (ASD vs. APD vs. PDD-NOS vs. NC) yielded, respectively, 89.8% accuracy and 82.1% macro-average accuracy, respectively. Findings from this study have illustrated the good potential of wavelet coherence technique in representing dynamic FC between brain nodes and open possibilities for its application in computer aided diagnosis of other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia.

Perceptual and motor skills	2021	Nathalie Lavenne-Collot, Nelle Jallot, Julie Maguet, Céline Degrez, Michel Botbol, Marine Grandgeorge	Service universitaire de psychiatrie infanto-juvénile, CHRU de Brest, Brest, France.	Our aim in this study was to affirm or negate (quantitatively) our subjective impression of altered hands and knees crawling (H&K crawling) among children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Through parental questionnaires and children's health records, we retrospectively compared early motor skills, including the frequency of H&K crawling in 79 children with Autistic Disorder or Asperger Syndrome versus 100 children with typical development (TD). We found H&K crawling to be significantly less frequent among children with ASD (44.2%) versus children with TD (69%). Children with ASD also showed a decreased frequency of acquiring a seating position without help and a later mean walking age compared to the TD children. These data suggest that early motor development delays may be a useful sign for detecting ASD at early ages.

International journal of environmental research and public health	2021	Irene Gómez-Marí, Pilar Sanz-Cervera, Raúl Tárraga-Mínguez	Department of Education and School Management, Faculty of Teacher Training, University of Valencia, 46022 Valencia, Spain.	(1) Every day, people with functional diversity face different kinds of difficulties that pose a barrier to their social inclusion. These difficulties often go unnoticed by most citizens. Social networks are a powerful tool to sensitize the population. With this objective, different organizations such as associations, federations, foundations, and other institutions have promoted campaigns through the celebration of world days for different types of functional diversity. This research aims to monitor and analyze the impact of these social campaigns in Spain, including Asperger's syndrome, rare diseases, Down syndrome, autism, hearing and visual impairment, cerebral palsy, dyslexia, ADHD, spina bifida, disability, and dyscalculia world days, between 2015 and 2020. (2) The impact of each campaign on the press, Google, and Twitter has been analyzed using: MyNews, Google Trends, and Trendinalia. (3) The results suggest a close relationship between the impact on the number of pieces of news generated in the press, the searches on Google, and the hashtags in high positions on Twitter. (4) The campaigns with the greatest levels of success are those whose diagnoses involve greater difficulties in adaptive behavior. These results can provide some practical implications for future campaigns.

College of Education, Psychology and Social Work, Flinders University, Sturt Road, Bedford Park, South, 5042, Australia.	Although people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are not more likely to commit crimes, they are overrepresented in the criminal justice system as reported by Howlin (Autism and Asperger syndrome: Preparing for adulthood, Routledge, 2004). This may, in part, be due to unfavourable interactions with the criminal judiciary. Evidence suggests the autistic population are perceived unfavourably in adjudicative proceedings resulting in harsher penalties. The present study explores whether ASD offenders (ASD-O) receive longer sentences compared to national sentencing data. Sentencing data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) were used to compare ASD-O with similar offences. ASD-O attracted longer sentences across all offence classifications. Inferential analyses indicated sexual assault sentences were significantly higher in the ASD-O sample. No significant differences were found for murder, manslaughter, and assault.

Child and adolescent mental health	2021	Melissa Chapple, Joanne Deborah Worsley	Department of Primary Care and Mental Health, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.	Since the implementation of 'autism' as a diagnosable condition in the 1980s, the medical model has continued to dominate how we understand autism. More recently, there has been a rise in understanding autism through the neurodiversity model and the lived experiences of autistic people themselves. However, there is often misalignment between the medical model and the preferences of the autistic community. In particular, there are misalignments around the language we use in society to discuss autism and autistic people. Language misalignments are particularly important, with language playing an important role in conveying understandings of a group within society. This article highlights these nomenclature misalignments, focussing on (1) Asperger syndrome, (2) functioning labels, (3) severity assumptions, (4) the language of disorder and (5) identity-first compared to person-first language. The article discusses the difficulties that might present in healthcare settings as a result of these misalignments.

Herzschrittmachertherapie & Elektrophysiologie	2021	Ralph Bosch	Cardio Centrum Ludwigsburg-Bietigheim (CCLB), Asperger Str. 48, 71634, Ludwigsburg, Deutschland. r.bosch@cclb.de.	This review discusses important aspects of pathophysiology, diagnosis and therapy of reflex syncope. The autonomic nervous system plays a crucial role in the origin of this frequently observed form of syncope. In most cases, reflex syncopes occur under specific circumstances. Thus, a detailed history is essential. Besides a physical exam und a normal 12-lead ECG, dedicated tests like tilt-table-testing, carotid massage and the implantation of a loop recorder often assist in making the correct diagnosis. The basis of therapy for all patients is reassurance about the benign course of the disease as well as education about adequate measures. Pharmacotherapy is reserved to a minority of patients. In older patients with repeat or severe syncopes and documented asystoles, pacemaker therapy is a valuable option.

Although most persons with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) wish to have romantic and/or sexual relationships, little is known about self-report sexuality of adolescents/young adults with ASD. In this exploratory study, 172 male and female adolescents/young adults (68 with ASD and 104 without ASD) completed an online version of the Sexual Behavior Scale-Third edition. Although many more similarities than differences were observed between the groups for views and desires about romantic relationships (e.g., wishing to have a girlfriend/boyfriend), fewer participants with ASD (mostly boys) had experience with a variety of sexual/dyadic behaviors, and approximately half of girls with ASD reported negative sexual experiences. Significantly higher rates of participants with ASD felt their knowledge about sexuality was limited and found it difficult to understand sexual education compared with typically developing (TD) participants. Significantly lower rates of participants with ASD reported that they identify to their assigned gender compared with TD participants. Multiple regressions revealed that being older at first diagnosis and possessing better knowledge about sexuality were significant predictors of both positive and negative sexual experience. This study explores strengths and challenges related with the sexual health of adolescents/young adults with ASD and implications for clinical and educational practice are discussed.

The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European Union (ASDEU) survey investigated the knowledge and health service experiences of users and providers to generate new hypotheses and scientific investigations that would contribute to improvement in health care for autistic adults. An online survey designed for autistic adults, carers of autistic adults, and professionals in adult services was translated into 11 languages and distributed electronically by organizations and in-country adult service facilities in 2017; 522 autistic adults, 442 carers, and 113 professionals provided answers to the health questions. Professionals, the majority in non-medical services, appeared to be poorly informed about whether certain co-occurring conditions were more frequent in autistic adults than typical adults-especially some medical conditions, suicide attempts, accidents, and pain. A minority of autistic adults reported preventive health behaviors such as routine health check-ups. The majority of users and providers expressed the desire to make health care services more user-friendly for autistic adults. Among the three groups, <20% of responders knew an organization or clinician which has developed a way to monitor health, and prevent poor health, that works well for adults on the autism spectrum. The results point to means for better management of co-occurring conditions associated with autism in adulthood in order to reduce hospital admissions and potential areas of improvement in health and social services for autistic adults. Specifically, efforts should be focused on (1) professionals' education on risks for co-occurring conditions in autistic adults; (2) promoting preventive health behaviors; (3) making services user-friendly for autistic adults and their families; and (4) encouraging knowledge of good local services.

Faculty of Education, Østfold University College, 1757 Halden, Norway.	The purpose of this study was to examine Internet trends data and sentiment in tweets mentioning autism, Asperger syndrome, and Greta Thunberg during 2019. We used mixed methods in analyzing sentiment and attitudes in viral tweets and collected 1074 viral tweets on autism that were published in 2019 (tweets that got more than 100 likes). The sample from Twitter was compared with search patterns on Google. In 2019, Asperger syndrome was closely connected to Greta Thunberg, as of the tweets specifically mentioning Asperger (from the total sample of viral tweets mentioning autism), 83% also mentioned Thunberg. In the sample of tweets about Thunberg, the positive sentiment expressed that Greta Thunberg was a role model, whereas the tweets that expressed the most negativity used her diagnosis against her and could be considered as cyberbullying. The Google Trends data also showed that Thunberg was closely connected to search patterns on Asperger syndrome in 2019. The study showed that being open about health information while being an active participant in controversial debates might be used against you but also help break stigmas and stereotypes.

The ability to discriminate the origin of stimuli, known as source monitoring, is crucial for self-other distinction and the integration of internally generated and externally generated experiences. Despite its valence, evidence on source monitoring in autism is yet scarce and unclear. We systematically reviewed literature concerning source monitoring in autism and its relationship with other constructs, such as memory type, encoding effects, social cognition, general intelligence, and clinical factors. Source-monitoring performance (operationalized as error or accuracy) was reduced in autistic participants in 9 of the 15 studies that met the inclusion criteria. When explicitly investigated, free-recall memory impairments in autism were shown to influence source monitoring deficits. General intelligence was another important factor linked to source-monitoring performance. Conversely, other memory types or encoding effects were not impaired in autism, and no univocal association could be found with source monitoring. Social cognition and clinical symptoms were rarely assessed in spite of their possible involvement in source monitoring. The heterogeneity of the task design, outcome measures and demographical factors limited study comparability. As a research framework on source monitoring as a construct of primary interest in autism is still lacking, we propose preliminary indications for future investigations based on the collected findings.

Liquid Biopsy (LB) in the form of e.g., circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is a promising non-invasive approach to support current therapeutic cancer management. However, the proof of clinical utility of CTCs in informing therapeutic decision-making for e.g., breast cancer in clinical trials and associated translational research projects is facing the issues of low CTC positivity rates and low CTC numbers - even in the metastasized situation. To compensate for this dilemma, clinical CTC trials are designed as large multicenter endeavors with decentralized sample collection, processing and storage of products, making data management highly important to enable high-quality translational CTC research.

The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European Union (ASDEU) survey investigated local services' use experiences of autistic adults, carers and professionals with interventions for autistic adults. The majority of the 697 participants experienced recommended considerations prior to deciding on intervention and during the intervention plan and implementation. Psychosocial interventions were the most commonly experienced interventions, while pharmacological interventions NOT recommended for core autistic symptoms were reported by fairly large proportions of participants. Family interventions were experienced slightly more commonly by carers than adults or professionals. Less than the 26% of autistic adult responders who had experienced challenging behaviors reported receiving an intervention to change them. These results provide insights for improving gaps in service provision of interventions among autistic adults.

"Understanding the autistic brain and the involvement of genetic, non-genetic, and numerous signaling pathways in the etiology and pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is complex, as is evident from various studies. Apart from multiple developmental disorders of the brain, autistic subjects show a few characteristics like impairment in social communications related to repetitive, restricted, or stereotypical behavior, which suggests alterations in neuronal circuits caused by defects in various signaling pathways during embryogenesis. Most of the research studies on ASD subjects and genetic models revealed the involvement of mutated genes with alterations of numerous signaling pathways like Wnt, hedgehog, and Retinoic Acid (RA). Despite significant improvement in understanding the pathogenesis and etiology of ASD, there is an increasing awareness related to it as well as a need for more in-depth research because no effective therapy has been developed to address ASD symptoms. Therefore, identifying better therapeutic interventions like ""novel drugs for ASD"" and biomarkers for early detection and disease condition determination are required. This review article investigated various etiological factors as well as the signaling mechanisms and their alterations to understand ASD pathophysiology. It summarizes the mechanism of signaling pathways, their significance, and implications for ASD."

33852211		[Autism spectrum disorder in verbal adults without intellectual disabilities (Asperger syndrome)].	Revue medicale suisse	2021	Hedi Klila, Fabienne Giuliani	Psychiatres et psychothérapeutes, Rue du Midi 4, 1003 Lausanne.	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder associating persistent communication and social interaction deficits with behaviors, interests or activities of a restricted and repetitive nature. The etiology of ASD is not yet fully understood but appears to be multifactorial, including both genetic and environmental factors. The concept of autism underwent a major evolution before arriving at the current definition in DSM-5. The diagnosis has two parts: a categorical from cut-off and differential diagnosis established from a specification of the category by dimensional variables (intelligence, language, associated diseases, adaptation). These two parts (categorical diagnosis and specifiers) are complementary but pose a certain number of practical problems in establishing the diagnosis in adulthood.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental condition with a prevalence rate above 1%, characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction; restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities; and a preference for sameness and routines. The majority of adult ASD patients suffer from comorbid conditions such as depression and anxiety. Therapy options for adult ASD patients are lacking, with presently no available evidence-based interventions in Germany. Recently, two interventions to improve social responsiveness have been published. FASTER (""Freiburger Asperger-Spezifische Therapie für ERwachsene"" = Freiburg Asperger-specific therapy for adults) is a manualized group psychotherapy program including three modules on psychoeducation, stress regulation management, and non-verbal and verbal social communication training with videotaped tasks. SCOTT&EVA (""Social Cognition Training Tool"", and its enhancement ""Emotionen Verstehen und Ausdruecken"" = understanding and expressing emotions) is a computer-based training program to enhance social cognition including video and audio material of emotional expressions and complex real-life social situations. Initial studies for both programs have shown good feasibility and efficacy."

In the past two decades, several screening instruments were developed to detect toddlers who may be autistic both in clinical and unselected samples. Among others, the Quantitative CHecklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) is a quantitative and normally distributed measure of autistic traits that demonstrates good psychometric properties in different settings and cultures. Recently, machine learning (ML) has been applied to behavioral science to improve the classification performance of autism screening and diagnostic tools, but mainly in children, adolescents, and adults. In this study, we used ML to investigate the accuracy and reliability of the Q-CHAT in discriminating young autistic children from those without. Five different ML algorithms (random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN)) were applied to investigate the complete set of Q-CHAT items. Our results showed that ML achieved an overall accuracy of 90%, and the SVM was the most effective, being able to classify autism with 95% accuracy. Furthermore, using the SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE) approach, we selected a subset of 14 items ensuring 91% accuracy, while 83% accuracy was obtained from the 3 best discriminating items in common to ours and the previously reported Q-CHAT-10. This evidence confirms the high performance and cross-cultural validity of the Q-CHAT, and supports the application of ML to create shorter and faster versions of the instrument, maintaining high classification accuracy, to be used as a quick, easy, and high-performance tool in primary-care settings.

International journal of molecular sciences	2021	Cecilia Maria Esposito, Massimiliano Buoli, Valentina Ciappolino, Carlo Agostoni, Paolo Brambilla	Department of Neurosciences and Mental Health, Fondazione IRCCS Ca'Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Via F. Sforza 35, 20122 Milan, Italy. Department of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan, 20122 Milan, Italy.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders whose pathogenesis seems to be related to an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, which leads to disrupted connectivity during brain development. Among the various biomarkers that have been evaluated in the last years, metabolic factors represent a bridge between genetic vulnerability and environmental aspects. In particular, cholesterol homeostasis and circulating fatty acids seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of ASDs, both through the contribute in the stabilization of cell membranes and the modulation of inflammatory factors. The purpose of the present review is to summarize the available data about the role of cholesterol and fatty acids, mainly long-chain ones, in the onset of ASDs. A bibliographic research on the main databases was performed and 36 studies were included in our review. Most of the studies document a correlation between ASDs and hypocholesterolemia, while the results concerning circulating fatty acids are less univocal. Even though further studies are necessary to confirm the available data, the metabolic biomarkers open to new treatment options such as the modulation of the lipid pattern through the diet.

Autism spectrum disorders are neurodevelopmental complex diseases with causative de-novo and inherited genetic factors. They include a range of cognitive and behavioral conditions such as pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger's syndrome, and autism. Cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, as a cytogenetic study has been considered as one of the indicators of chromosomal damage in peripheral blood. This study aimed to investigate the frequency of micronucleus (MN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of parents with autistic children. The study was case-control and the cases were parents of autistic children referring to the psychiatric department of the Ali-Asghar Hospital of Tehran. The total number of samples was 60 cases and 30 controls. The results showed that autistic children's parents had a significant increase in MN frequency in binucleated lymphocytes. Further researches are suggested to analyze the environmental and genetic reasons for MN increase in autistic children parents.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with high services use, but European data on costs are scarce. Utilisation and annual costs of 385 individuals with ASD (aged 4-67 years; 18.2% females; 37.4% IQ < 85) from German outpatient clinics were assessed. Average annual costs per person were 3287 EUR, with psychiatric inpatient care (19.8%), pharmacotherapy (11.1%), and occupational therapy (11.1%) being the largest cost components. Females incurred higher costs than males (4864 EUR vs. 2936 EUR). In a regression model, female sex (Cost Ratio: 1.65), lower IQ (1.90), and Asperger syndrome (1.54) were associated with higher costs. In conclusion, ASD-related health costs are comparable to those of schizophrenia, thus underlining its public health relevance. Higher costs in females demand further research.

Biosciences Institute, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.	This paper, written in honor of Professor Ed Zigler, focuses on some of the themes in developmental disabilities research that were so central to his work. It has now been nearly 80 years since Leo Kanner first identified the prototypic form - early infantile autism - of what is now autism spectrum disorder. In this article we summarize the development of the concept and the important accumulation of knowledge over time that has now led us to the recognition of a broader autism phenotype just as, at the same time, the current official diagnostic system in the USA has narrowed the concept. We also address current controversies regarding autism as the diagnosis is impacted by age and developmental factors, gender, and cultural issues. In parallel to the work on intellectual deficiency and development pioneered by Zigler and his colleagues, we summarize some of the challenges for the years ahead.

Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric disorder with a complex genetic background. Analysis of altered molecular processes in ASD patients requires linear and nonlinear methods that provide interpretable solutions. Interpretable machine learning provides legible models that allow explaining biological mechanisms and support analysis of clinical subgroups. In this work, we investigated several case-control studies of gene expression measurements of ASD individuals. We constructed a rule-based learning model from three independent datasets that we further visualized as a nonlinear gene-gene co-predictive network. To find dissimilarities between ASD subtypes, we scrutinized a topological structure of the network and estimated a centrality distance. Our analysis revealed that autism is the most severe subtype of ASD, while pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified and Asperger syndrome are closely related and milder ASD subtypes. Furthermore, we analyzed the most important ASD-related features that were described in terms of gene co-predictors. Among others, we found a strong co-predictive mechanism between

"The term ""Autism spectrum disorder"" (ASD), in vogue at present, has evolved after continual substantial developments taking place over more than a century. ASD is a heterogeneous, multi-factorial, developmental disability in which an unusual pattern of development takes place during infant and toddler years. As per DSM-5, Autism spectrum disorder is a combined phrase for a family of complex developmental disabilities inclusive of ""Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger's Disorder"". ""ASD is characterized not only by persistent impairments in reciprocal social communication and social interactions, but is also manifested by restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities"". The classical clinical signs that exist in two major domains, viz. the 'social domain' and the 'behavioral domain' for the precise diagnosis of ASD have been tabulated and major differences between DSM-5 and DSM-4 are depicted with the help of a figure in this basic review article. A sharp rise in the incidence of ASD cases has been observed worldwide owing to various risk factors such as genetic predisposition coupled with adverse environmental conditions, gynecological interventions, etc. Two official manuals viz. the ""Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders"" (DSM) (published by the American Psychiatric Association), and the ""International Classification of Diseases"" (ICD) (published by the World Health Organization) is being regularly updated to facilitate diagnosis of ASD. ICD-11 guidelines being prospectively implemented with effect from January 2022 have attracted global attention."

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2021	Yi-Ling Chien, Chi-Shin Wu, Hui-Ju Tsai	Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan.	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder are often diagnosed with at least one or more accompanying disorders. Most studies reported prevalence of the psychiatric comorbidities among these individuals; however, the incidence of developing comorbidities is unclear. This study used Taiwan's claims database and aimed to investigate the incidence of developing major psychiatric comorbidities in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and whether the incidence was moderated by gender, autism-spectrum disorder subtypes, and autism-associated neurodevelopmental conditions. A total of 3,837 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (2,929 autistic disorder, 447 Asperger syndrome, 461 pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified) and 38,370 comparison subjects, who were matched by age and gender, were included. The incidences of schizophrenia spectrum, bipolar, and major depressive disorders was examined. The results showed that the incidences of schizophrenia spectrum (9.7 per 1,000 person-year), bipolar disorder (7.0 per 1,000 person-year), and major depressive disorder (3.2 per 1,000 person-year) were significantly higher than the comparison group across all three subtypes of autism-spectrum disorder. Individuals with pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified had higher risk for major depressive disorder than autistic disorder. Females with Asperger syndrome had significant higher risk for schizophrenia spectrum than males. The comorbidity rate dramatically dropped when the autism-associated neurodevelopmental conditions were taken into account. Our findings suggested that the incidences of major psychiatric comorbidities were higher in autism spectrum disorder and influenced by autism subtypes, gender, and autism-associated neurodevelopmental conditions. LAY SUMMARY: We examined whether people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have higher incidence of schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, and major depression using a large claims database. The results showed the incidences of these mental illness among individual with ASD were significantly higher than those without ASD. In addition, the incidences were influenced by autism subtypes, gender, and comorbid neurodevelopmental conditions.

Autism spectrum disorder is an emerging public health issue. The core features of autism spectrum disorder are persistent impairment in reciprocal social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests. We now know that it encompasses disorders previously referred to as early infantile autism, childhood autism, Kanner autism, high-functioning autism, atypical autism, Asperger disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. While it is agreed that the etiology of autism spectrum disorder is largely unknown, certain environmental and genetic factors may be responsible for the disease. In particular, emerging evidence has suggested the role of C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene as a possible risk factor. We present the case of a two-year-old boy with high risk for autism who was found on advanced investigation to have heterozygous polymorphism for MTHFR. This prompted us to add folic acid to his therapeutic regime. He was treated with high-dose folic acid along with conventional intervention, and went on to make excellent recovery. We conclude that pharmacological intervention has the potential to improve outcome in a subgroup of autistic children.

Catatonia was first described by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in 1874, occurring in association with other psychiatric and medical disorders. However, in the nineteenth century the disorder was incorrectly classified as a subtype of schizophrenia. This misclassification persisted until the publication of DSM-5 in 2013 when important changes were incorporated. Although the etiology is unknown, disrupted gamma-aminobutyric acid has been proposed as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Key symptoms can be identified under 3 clinical domains: motor, speech, and behavioral. Benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are the only known effective treatments. Timely recognition and treatment have important outcome, and sometimes lifesaving, implications.

Often labeled as behavioral disorders or psychological reactions, comorbid psychiatric disorders are common. Bipolar disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders that occur in persons with autism across their life spans. It can be comorbid with and mistaken for several other conditions. Similarly, psychosis occurs in several psychiatric disorders. Schizophrenia is the prototype psychotic disorder that has a close but controversial relationship with autism. Assessment and treatment of bipolar disorder and psychosis should be based on their individual characteristics, family dynamics, and community resources.

The wide spectrum of unique needs and strengths of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is a challenge for the worldwide healthcare system. With the plethora of information from research, a common thread is required to conceptualize an exhaustive pathogenetic paradigm. The epidemiological and clinical findings in ASD cannot be explained by the traditional linear genetic model, hence the need to move towards a more fluid conception, integrating genetics, environment, and epigenetics as a whole. The embryo-fetal period and the first two years of life (the so-called 'First 1000 Days') are the crucial time window for neurodevelopment. In particular, the interplay and the vicious loop between immune activation, gut dysbiosis, and mitochondrial impairment/oxidative stress significantly affects neurodevelopment during pregnancy and undermines the health of ASD people throughout life. Consequently, the most effective intervention in ASD is expected by primary prevention aimed at pregnancy and at early control of the main effector molecular pathways. We will reason here on a comprehensive and exhaustive pathogenetic paradigm in ASD, viewed not just as a theoretical issue, but as a tool to provide suggestions for effective preventive strategies and personalized, dynamic (from womb to adulthood), systemic, and interdisciplinary healthcare approach.

Research providing an evidence-base for autistic adult services is sparse. The Autism Spectrum Disorders in the European Union (ASDEU) network implemented an on-line survey to determine gaps in autistic adult diagnostic evaluation and post-diagnostic support services. More than 55% in all groups experienced most of the recommended features for diagnostic evaluation for autistic adults. In contrast, < 2% of adults or carers, and < 21% of professionals experienced each of the recommended features for post-diagnostic support. In contrast to 61% of professionals, only about 30% of autistic adults and carers had knowledge of good local services models for autism diagnosis in adulthood. There are major differences between good practice guidelines for diagnostic and post-diagnostic care for autistic adults, and what is actually experienced by services users and professionals.

Institute of Legal Medicine, University Hospital Bonn, Stiftsplatz 12, 53111, Bonn, Germany.	A 41-year-old man was found by his wife in an atypical hanging situation in their apartment. As there was a known previous psychiatric illness and a history of suicide attempts, the investigative authorities assumed this case was a suicide. However, the autopsy revealed numerous findings that are unusual for a suicidal atypical hanging, including numerous cuts on the face, the arms and the penis. According to his wife, the deceased suffered from Asperger's syndrome with auto-aggressive behavior. He had allegedly injured himself with household scissors in the days before his death and had hit himself numerous times in the face the night before his death. His wife also revealed that she would injure him with scissors at his request. Even though the observed injury pattern in this case contradicted a self-infliction, the information given by the wife about the chronology of the occurrence of injuries could be reconciled with the findings of the immunohistochemical estimation of wound age. The circumstances that led to the hanging remained unresolved.

International journal of environmental research and public health	2020	Raúl Tárraga-Mínguez, Irene Gómez-Marí, Pilar Sanz-Cervera	Department of Education and School Management, Faculty of Teacher Training, University of Valencia, 46022 Valencia, Spain.	"Social campaigns are carried out to promote autism spectrum disorder (ASD) awareness, normalization, and visibility. The internet helps to shape perceptions of Asperger syndrome and autism. In fact, these campaigns often coincide with the increase in searches for both diagnoses on Google. We have two study objectives: to use Google Trends to identify the annual time points from 2015 to 2019 with the highest Google search traffic in Spain for the terms ""autism"" and ""Asperger"", and to identify news and trending topics related to ASD that took place during the weeks with the highest number of Google searches for these terms. Google Trend, MyNews and Trendinalia were used to analyze the volume of searches and trending topics related to ASD. As a result, social marketing campaigns, social networks and the publication of news items act as powerful voices that can provide a realistic or sensationalist picture of the disorder. For this reason, we concluded that campaigns play an important role in the normalization of ASD, and that it is important for organizations concerned with the visibility and social inclusion of people with ASD to check the way ASD is portrayed through the internet, media, and social networks."

Prosody, the rhythm and melody of speech, is an important component of effective communication, and it is an area of difficulty for many populations who struggle with communication. This paper is a meta-analysis of nine studies (and two sets of unpublished data) that assessed prosody using the Profiling Elements of Prosody in Speech-Communication (PEPS-C; Peppé & McCann, 2003) in autism spectrum disorder, Williams syndrome, and Down syndrome. Our original goal was to include studies involving any neurodevelopmental disorder that is commonly associated with intellectual disability, yet our systematic search, which included three databases (i.e., PsychInfo, ERIC, and PubMed), only identified studies involving these three groups. To be included in the meta-analysis, studies had to include a group (n ≥ 3 participants) with a neurodevelopmental disorder commonly associated with intellectual disability and a typically developing comparison group matched on chronological age, nonverbal abilities, or verbal abilities. Studies also needed to report original data using the PEPS-C and be available in English. Study quality was assessed using a checklist adapted from Downes et al. (2016). Results revealed that prosodic form was a weakness for each etiology, while unique patterns of strengths and weaknesses were evident for prosodic functions. Groups with autism (n = 5), all classified as high-functioning or with Asperger's syndrome, exhibited weakness in emotional affect but some relative strengths with turn-end and focus tasks. Groups with Williams syndrome (n = 4) demonstrated weaknesses on phrase/sentence-level tasks and relative strengths on word-level tasks. Groups with Down syndrome (n = 2) had the greatest difficulty overall, though performance was better on receptive (vs. expressive) function tasks. By combining studies and related subtasks of the PEPS-C, we are able to more confidently generalize findings for each population and identify targets for intervention. However, given the limited number of studies identified, this paper also highlights the need for more research on prosody in intellectual disability.

Unidad Académica Hermosillo, Universidad Estatal de Sonora, Hermosillo, Mexico.	This study examines how advertising material and brands related to organizational communication are perceived by people with Asperger syndrome, a form of autism. The main objective of the study was to understand whether the perception of advertising differs between individuals with AS and a neurotypical population. Neuromarketing techniques were used to examine two key variables, attention and emotion, which were also measured by physiological and biometric variables. The results were compared with those of a control group from a neurotypical population; i.e., participants who had not been diagnosed with any type of developmental disorder. Commercial advertisements were the preferred material used in this research although social-themed advertisements were also included, some produced by commercial companies and others by institutional advertisers (NGOs and foundations). Qualitative techniques were also used to explain the observed phenomena. Data revealed significant differences between the two groups in their perception of advertising and organizational communication with respect to attention and emotion variables.

Acceleration and unification of drug discovery is important to reduce the effort and cost of new drug development. Diverse chemical and biological conditions, specialized infrastructure and incompatibility between existing analytical methods with high-throughput, nanoliter scale chemistry make the whole drug discovery process lengthy and expensive. Here, we demonstrate a chemBIOS platform combining on-chip chemical synthesis, characterization and biological screening. We developed a dendrimer-based surface patterning that enables the generation of high-density nanodroplet arrays for both organic and aqueous liquids. Each droplet (among > 50,000 droplets per plate) functions as an individual, spatially separated nanovessel, that can be used for solution-based synthesis or analytical assays. An additional indium-tin oxide coating enables ultra-fast on-chip detection down to the attomole per droplet by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. The excellent optical properties of the chemBIOS platform allow for on-chip characterization and in-situ reaction monitoring in the ultraviolet, visible (on-chip UV-Vis spectroscopy and optical microscopy) and infrared (on-chip IR spectroscopy) regions. The platform is compatible with various cell-biological screenings, which opens new avenues in the fields of high-throughput synthesis and drug discovery.

This paper analyses disfluencies and ungrammatical expressions in the speech of 11-13-year-old Finnish-speaking boys with ASD (N = 5) and with neurotypical development (N = 6). The ASD data were from authentic group therapy sessions and neurotypical data from teacher-led group discussions. The proportion of disfluencies and ungrammatical expressions was greater in the speech of participants with ASD (26.4%) than in the control group (15.5%). Furthermore, a qualitative difference was noted: The ASD group produced long, complex disfluent turns with word searches, self-repairs, false starts, fillers, prolongations, inconsistent syntactic structures and grammatical errors, whereas in the control group, the disfluencies were mainly fillers and sound prolongations. The disfluencies and ungrammatical expressions occurring in the ASD participants' interactions also caused comprehension problems.

Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is of paramount importance as it opens the road to early intervention, which is associated with better prognosis. However, early diagnosis is often delayed until preschool or school age. The purpose of the current retrospective study was to explore the age of recognition of first alarming symptoms in boys and girls as well as the age at diagnosis of different subtypes of ASD in a small sample. A total of 128 parents' of children with ASDs were participated in the survey by completing a self-report questionnaire about early signs and symptoms that raised their concern. Parents of children with autism voiced concerns earlier and obtained diagnosis significantly earlier compared to parents of children with Asperger syndrome (

Handbook of clinical neurology	2020	Laurent Mottron	Department of Psychiatry and Addictology, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. Electronic address: laurent.mottron@gmail.com.	Autism is a frequent, precocious behavioral constellation of social and communicative atypicalities associated with apparently restricted interests and repetitive behavior and paired with an uneven ability profile. Its definition has constantly broadened in the past 75 years, introducing phenotypes increasingly distant from its initial description, heterogeneous in intelligence and speech level, and associated conditions. When it is unassociated with other conditions, its origin is mostly genetic, transmissible, and favored by frequent polymorphisms with small effects present in the general population. Identified de novo rare mutations with large deleterious effects produce phenotypes only loosely related to nonsyndromic autism. Autism is associated with brain reorganization at multiple levels, and with a variant of typical information processing, i.e., the way humans perceive, memorize, manipulate, and attribute emotional value to available information. Its phenotype evolves over the span of life, with an overall reduction of autistic signs, but it still requires some level of support. There is no treatment for this condition; however, it is compatible with high levels of integration into society.

In order to be able to provide accurate genetic counseling to patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), it is crucial to identify correlations between heterogeneous phenotypes and genetic alterations. Among the hundreds of de novo pathogenic variants reported in ASD, single-nucleotide variations and small insertions/deletions were reported in TBR1. This gene encodes a transcription factor that plays a key role in brain development. Pathogenic variants in TBR1 are often associated with severe forms of ASD, including intellectual disability and language impairment.

We analyzed data from the Autism Treatment Network (ATN) dataset for 2,576 children ages 6 to 18 years of age diagnosed with ASD. Multivariable logistic regression accounting for age, gender, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Edition - Text Revision), diagnosis (Autistic Disorder, PDD-NOS, Asperger's Disorder), and parents' education did not show any racial or ethnic differences in behavioral challenges, conduct problems, or sleep disturbances for any of the groups, but Black children had lower odds of Total Problem Behaviors and Asian children had lower odds of Hyperactivity compared to White children. As a group, children from racial and ethnic minorities had lower odds of Total Problem Behaviors and Conduct Problems compared to White children. Hispanic children had lower odds of medication use for Behavioral Challenges, Total Problem Behaviors, Hyperactivity, and Conduct Problems. Asian children had lower odds of medication use for Behavioral Challenges, Total Problem Behaviors, and Hyperactivity; and had close to lower odds in medication use for Conduct Problems. Black children had lower odds for medication use for Total Problem Behaviors only. As a group, children from racial and ethnic minorities had lower odds for medication use for Behavioral Challenges, Total Problem Behaviors, Hyperactivity, and Conduct problems, but not for Sleep Disturbances. While these results are consistent with previous studies showing that White children are significantly more likely to receive psychotropic medication compared to children from racial and ethnic minority groups, we found no such differences for sleep challenges, suggesting that they are more consistently identified and equitably treated than other behavioral problems associated with ASD. We draw upon Andersen's (1995) Behavioral Model of Healthcare Use to suggest predisposing, enabling, and needs factors that may contribute to this pattern of racial and ethnic differences in the use of medications among children ASD.

"Autism spectrum disorder is a heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorder. The patients experience challenges in social interaction and communication skills as well as restricted and/or repetitive behaviors. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying developmental brain disorders, patient-derived cellular models represent a useful tool. We have generated a human induced pluripotent stem cell line (SDUKIi003-A) from skin fibroblasts derived from a 20-year old male patient diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (""FYNEN-cohort"" of Southern Denmark). The reprogramming of the fibroblasts was accomplished using integration-free episomal plasmids. Characterization validated the expression of pluripotency markers, differentiation into the three germ layers, and absence of chromosomal abnormalities."

In this study, we aim to verify how emotional training can improve empathy and theory of mind (ToM) in patients diagnosed with early onset schizophrenia and Asperger's syndrome. The study design includes 100 subjects divided into two experimental groups and two control groups. The two experimental groups followed a rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) protocol. The two control groups instead underwent cognitive behavioral psychotherapy training. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was applied to analyze the difference between the Asperger's syndrome (AS) and early onset schizophrenia (EOS) groups, pre and post training. Our analysis shows that the AS group improved post emotional training but only when emotions were internalized, as demonstrated by the improvement of the scores in the post-treatment eye test (ET) but not in the emotional quotient (EQ) test. The EOS group instead showed post-training improvement, not only concerning skills leading to internalizing emotions but also in empathy, as demonstrated by the improvement of EQ and Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (RFQ) test scores. These scores remained lower than in the control group. Finally, our findings reveal that the value of the treatment was more considerable for the EOS group than for the AS group due to the improvement in first- and second-order ToM skills and an improvement of empathic skills in the first group, followed by the group comprising AS subjects. In the AS group, the treatment only favored the enhancement of first-order ToM skills; however, this improved quality of life and social adaptation.

Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris, Pisa, Italy. sara.calderoni@fsm.unipi.it. Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris, Pisa, Italy.	This paper aims to propose that the psychiatrist George Frankl had more than a marginal role in the early history of autism. Frankl's conception of autism as characterized by a lack of affective language has influenced both Asperger and Kanner. First, this proposal is historically supported; second it is corroborated by Frankl's unpublished manuscript on Autism. We found that Frankl's perspective about autism was, and still can be, considered innovative for multiple reasons. Specifically, Frankl proposed that autism could cover a spectrum of conditions; that it is a state of mind that is not necessarily abnormal; and that it is a neurobiological condition, which primarily needs to be understood by others. Finally, Frankl's concepts of affective contact and affective language are reconsidered with reference to contemporary neuropsychology from which autism emerges not as a higher-order cognitive deficit, but as a result of an impairment of primordial ability to process low level sensory, motor and perceptual information gained through experiencing other persons.

Jordan13@uni.coventry.ac.uk. Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Coventry University, Coventry, UK.	It is recognised that a high proportion of adults on the autism spectrum experience depressive symptoms. However, limited research has explored autistic peoples' experiences of low mood and depression. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of low mood and depression for adults on the autism spectrum. The study employed Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis to investigate the experiences of 8 adults (7 males and 1 female), aged between 19 and 51, who had a diagnosis of autism without co-occurring learning disabilities, and experienced low mood or depression. All participants recorded their thoughts and feelings in a mood diary for 1 week and participated in a semi-structured interview. Three superordinate themes emerged from the data: 'Autism has made me the person I am', 'I can't function in the world' and 'It's like trying to do accounts on the futures market': Making sense of emotions. Findings highlight a need for specialist mental health provision for adults who are on the autism spectrum. Limitations of this study and implications for future research are discussed.

Thunberg's increased media attention coupled with her diagnosis-Asperger Syndrome (AS)-may foster help-seeking behaviors among those with similar psychiatric disorders. Using Google Trends data, we compared values of AS from the week of the UN Climate Summit through the end of the year compared to an ARIMA model predicting search interest had Thunberg not been in the media. The search trend for AS at peak was 254.07% higher than predicted and was on average 10.61 points above the projected model during this time. As the primary goal of AS intervention focuses on improving quality of life and preventing common comorbidities such as depression and anxiety, capitalizing on increased public interest in AS and help-seeking behaviors is imperative.

There is great phenotypic heterogeneity within autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which has led to question their classification into a single diagnostic category. The study of the common genetic variation in ASD has suggested a greater contribution of other psychiatric conditions in Asperger syndrome (AS) than in the rest of the DSM-IV ASD subtypes (Non_AS). Here, using available genetic data from previously performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we aimed to study the genetic overlap between five of the most related disorders (schizophrenia (SCZ), major depression disorder (MDD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and anxiety (ANX)), and AS, comparing it with the overlap in Non_AS subtypes. A Spanish cohort of autism trios (N = 371) was exome sequenced as part of the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC) and 241 trios were extensively characterized to be diagnosed with AS following DSM-IV and Gillberg's criteria (N = 39) or not (N = 202). Following exome imputation, polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated for ASD, SCZ, ADHD, MDD, ANX, and OCD (from available summary data from Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (PGC) repository) in the Spanish trios' cohort. By using polygenic transmission disequilibrium test (pTDT), we reported that risk for SCZ (P

Centre Hospitalier, Rouffach, France; CAMUHA, Université de Haute-Alsace, Mulhouse, France.	This article describes the history of the diagnostic class of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) up to DSM-5. We further analyze how the development of genetics will transform the classification and diagnosis of NDDs. In DSM-5, NDDs include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Physicians in German-, French- and English-speaking countries (eg, Weikard, Georget, Esquirol, Down, Asperger, and Kanner) contributed to the phenomenological definitions of these disorders throughout the 18th and 20th centuries. These diagnostic categories show considerable comorbidity and phenotypic overlap. NDDs are one of the chapters of psychiatric nosology most likely to benefit from the approach advocated by the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria project. Genetic research supports the hypothesis that ID, ASD, ADHD, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder lie on a neurodevelopmental continuum. The identification of recurrently observed copy number variants and disruptive gene variants in ASD (eg, CDH8, 16p11.2, SCN2A) led to the adoption of the genotype-first approach to characterize individuals at the etiological level. .

PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is a highly conserved heme binding protein, which is overexpressed especially in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and plays an important role in breast carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms by which PGRMC1 drives tumor progression. The aim of our study was to investigate the involvement of PGRMC1 in cholesterol metabolism to detect new mechanisms by which PGRMC1 can increase lipid metabolism and alter cancer-related signaling pathways leading to breast cancer progression.

Heliyon	2020	Christos Hadjipanayi, Despina Michael-Grigoriou	GET Lab, Department of Multimedia and Graphic Arts, Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus.	The immense capabilities provided by virtual reality for enhancing empathy and altering social behaviors, make it possible to use virtual reality for the promotion of the understanding between individuals. A social issue that needs to be addressed is the discrimination and marginalization of people with Asperger's syndrome (AS) from the working force, stemming from the lack of recognition and justification of their oddities. In this paper, the effectiveness of a virtual reality simulation, raising awareness on this specific issue, is evaluated. Awareness is a term used in this research to refer to the combination of conceptual knowledge and sensitization on a specific issue. An experiment with between-group design has been carried out, where half of the participants used the simulation via a VR headset device and the other half was given a transcript of relevant medical articles instead. The comparison between the two groups indicates that the group which used the simulation gained more knowledge on AS than the group which used the transcript. Moreover, the parameter of sensitization indicates positive correlations with place illusion in the VR group.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction, repetitive behavior, and additional features, such as special interests. Its precise etiology is unclear. Recently, immunological mechanisms, such as maternal autoantibodies/infections, have increasingly been the subject of discussion. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) investigations play a decisive role in the detection of immunological processes in the brain. This study therefore retrospectively analyzed the CSF findings of adult patients with ASD. CSF basic measures (white blood cell count, total protein, albumin quotient, immunoglobulin G (IgG) index, and oligoclonal bands) and various antineuronal antibody findings of 36 adult patients with ASD, who had received lumbar puncture, were compared with an earlier described mentally healthy control group of 39 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. CSF protein concentrations and albumin quotients of patients with ASD were significantly higher as compared to controls (age corrected:

Catatonia was first described by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in 1874, occurring in association with other psychiatric and medical disorders. However, in the nineteenth century the disorder was incorrectly classified as a subtype of schizophrenia. This misclassification persisted until the publication of DSM-5 in 2013 when important changes were incorporated. Although the etiology is unknown, disrupted gamma-aminobutyric acid has been proposed as the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Key symptoms can be identified under 3 clinical domains: motor, speech, and behavioral. Benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy are the only known effective treatments. Timely recognition and treatment have important outcome, and sometimes lifesaving, implications.

Often labeled as behavioral disorders or psychological reactions, comorbid psychiatric disorders are common. Bipolar disorder is one of the most common psychiatric disorders that occur in persons with autism across their life spans. It can be comorbid with and mistaken for several other conditions. Similarly, psychosis occurs in several psychiatric disorders. Schizophrenia is the prototype psychotic disorder that has a close but controversial relationship with autism. Assessment and treatment of bipolar disorder and psychosis should be based on their individual characteristics, family dynamics, and community resources.

The early recognition of ASD in adults is challenging, in particular due to the lack of appropriate and robust diagnostic tools. We performed a psychometric validation and diagnostic accuracy study of the French version of the RAADS-R on a sample of 305 adults: 105 with ASD without ID, 99 with psychiatric disorders, and 103 non-psychiatric control groups. The French version of the RAADS-R demonstrates good reliability and diagnostic validity, suggesting that it can help clinicians during the diagnostic process in adults with ASD without ID. However, the finding that a two-factor structure better fits the results requires further validation. This study point out the need of further study of RAADS in psychiatric disorders group due to the relatively high false positive rate (55.6%) of ASD.

Severe malocclusions appear in up to 20 per cent of the population. Many neuropsychiatric diseases are likely to have a neurodevelopmental, partially genetic background with their origins as early as fetal life. However, the possible relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and severe malocclusions is unclear. The aim of this study was in a population-based setting (270 000 inhabitants) to investigate whether patients with severe malocclusions have more mental and behavioural disorders and growth or speech problems than controls without severe malocclusion.

Orléans University, CNRS, INEM, UMR 7355, Orleans, France. Aix Marseille University, CNRS, INP, UMR 7051, Marseille, France.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders with a very large number of risk loci detected in the genome. However, at best, each of them explains rare cases, the majority being idiopathic. Genomic data on ASD derive mostly from post-mortem brain analyses or cell lines derived from blood or patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCS). Therefore, the transcriptional and regulatory architecture of the nervous system, particularly during early developmental periods, remains highly incomplete. To access the critical disturbances that may have occurred during pregnancy or early childhood, we recently isolated stem cells from the nasal cavity of anesthetized patients diagnosed for ASD and compared them to stem cells from gender-matched control individuals without neuropsychiatric disorders. This allowed us to discover MOCOS, a non-mutated molybdenum cofactor sulfurase-coding gene that was under-expressed in the stem cells of most ASD patients of our cohort, disturbing redox homeostasis and synaptogenesis. We now report that a divergent transcription upstream of MOCOS generates an antisense long noncoding RNA, to which we coined the name COSMOC. Surprisingly, COSMOC is strongly under-expressed in all ASD patients of our cohort with the exception of a patient affected by Asperger syndrome. Knockdown studies indicate that loss of COSMOC reduces MOCOS expression, destabilizes lipid and energy metabolisms of stem cells, but also affects neuronal maturation and splicing of synaptic genes. Impaired expression of the COSMOC/MOCOS bidirectional unit might shed new lights on the origins of ASD that could be of importance for future translational studies.

Klinik für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie, Psychosomatik und Psychotherapie, Fachbereich Medizin, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Hans-Sachs-Str. 4, 35039, Marburg, Deutschland. kampbeck@med.uni-marburg.de.	Autistic disorders are summarized in DSM‑5 under the term autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and are severe, lifelong, pervasive neurodevelopmental disorders. Core features manifested even in childhood are impairments in social interaction and communication as well as restricted and repetitive behavior. The intensity of symptoms, language and cognitive impairments vary but the majority of affected individuals have below average intelligence and 80% have at least one comorbid disorder. The diverse pathology and heterogeneity in phenotypes are caused by a complex genetic etiology, which is associated with a reduced synaptic plasticity of neural networks. The disorder is associated with a clearly reduced quality of life as well as a high familial burden. The differential diagnostics have a high relevance and the diagnosis should be carried out by specialized institutions. Behavioral therapeutic interventions are indicated.
32298047	doi: 10.1002/aur.2304	Characteristic Executive Dysfunction for High-Functioning Autism Sustained to Adulthood.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2020	Rao Xie, Xiao Sun, Li Yang, Yanqing Guo	Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Centre for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), NHC Key Laboratory of Mental Health, (Peking University), Beijing, China.	The comprehensiveness and severity of executive dysfunction in high-functioning autism (HFA) spectrum disorder have not reached a unified conclusion especially in patients in adulthood. Clarifying this issue is critical for guiding clinical diagnosis and targeted intervention. The primary objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the characteristics of executive function (EF) in adults with HFA compared to typically developing (TD) adults, by taking five key components into consideration, including inhibition, working memory, flexibility, planning, and fluency. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that compared EF in adults with and without HFA from 1980 to November 2018. Hedges' g effect sizes were computed to measure the primary outcome. Moderators like age, sex, and diagnostic tools were controlled using meta-regressions. Forty-two studies satisfying the selection criteria were included, which resulted in a large sample size of 2419 participants. A moderate overall effect size for reduced EF across domains was found in adults with HFA, compared with TD (g = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.47-0.66). Subsequently, a broad executive dysfunction was found in adults with HFA in this study (flexibility [g = 0.69], planning [g = 0.64], inhibition [g = 0.61], working memory [g = 0.48], fluency [g = 0.42]), with the predominated impairment on flexibility and planning. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the executive dysfunction hypothesis and may assist in the clinical diagnosis and targeted intervention, suggesting the necessity of sustained intervention on EF for individuals with HFA from childhood to adulthood. LAY SUMMARY: The meta-analysis explored the characteristics of EF in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) comparing to typically developing controls. Moderate effect sizes for reduced EF across domains were found in adults with HFA, with the flexibility and planning being the most predominately impaired. A comprehensive measurement of EF in adults with HFA has important clinical implications for the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and a fundamental understanding for developmental trajectory of these patients.

Biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are lacking but would facilitate drug development for the core deficits of the disorder. We evaluated markers proposed for characterization of differences in social communication and interaction in adults with ASD versus healthy controls (HC) for utility as biomarkers. Data pooled from an observational study and baseline data from a placebo-controlled study were analyzed. Between-group differences were observed in eye-tracking tasks for activity monitoring, biomotion, human activity preference, composite score (p = 0.0001-0.037) and pupillometry (various tasks, p = 0.017-0.05). Impaired olfaction was more common in the ASD sample versus HC (p = 0.018). Our preliminary results suggest the potential use for stratification and response sub-analyses outcome-prediction of specific eye-tracking tasks, pupillometry and olfaction tests in ASD trials.

Međimurske vode d.o.o., Matice hrvatske 10, HR-40000 Čakovec, Croatia.	Climate change and the increased demand for food amplified the global problem with water supply for irrigation. This work deals with the reclamation of municipal wastewater (MWW) for irrigation by a membrane bioreactor (MBR), nanofiltration (NF), and reverse osmosis (RO). The emphasis was on the comparison of physico-chemical and microbiological parameters with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Union (EU) guidelines. In addition, the detection and removal of contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) from the Watch List (EU Decision 2015/495) were examined. Firstly, the MWW was monitored (physico-chemical and microbiological parameters, trace elements, and occurrence of CECs) for six months. Thereafter, the MWW was treated with MBR, NF, and RO. The reclaimed water satisfied the physico-chemical and microbiological quality requirements only after additional NF/RO treatment. Membrane bioreactor efficiently removed methiocarb (>99.9%), tri-allate (>99.9%), clothianidin (88.0%), and clarithromycin (71.9-74.2%), while the removal of azithromycin, acetamiprid, and oxadiazon was around 30%. The low and even negative removal during MBR treatment was observed for diclofenac (15%), clothianidin (-14%), imidacloprid (-18%), and diclofenac (-157%). Additional treatment of MBR effluent with NF90 and XLE membranes resulted in complete rejection of detected CECs, while NF270 membrane achieved results between 75% and 91%.

Desorption/ionization induced by neutral clusters (DINeC) is used as an ultrasoft desorption/ionization method for the analysis of fragile biomolecules by means of mass spectrometry (MS). As a test molecule, the glycopeptide vancomycin was measured with DINeC-MS, and resulting mass spectra were compared to the results obtained with electrospray ionization (ESI), matrix assisted laser desorption ionization, and time-of-flight secondary ion MS. Of the desorption-based techniques, DINeC spectra show the lowest abundance of fragments comparable to ESI spectra. The soft desorption nature of DINeC was further demonstrated when applied to MS analysis of teicoplanin.

Clinical child psychology and psychiatry	2020	Nicholas Bond, Rudi Dallos, Rebecca McKenzie	Department of Clinical Psychology, University of Plymouth, UK.	The article examines the experience of parenting a child with a diagnosis of autism with a focus on scripts and intentions in relation to the parents' own childhood experiences of being parented. Five parents participated in a multiple case study design involving in-depth interviews, Adult Attachment Interviews and a parenting intentions scaling task. The findings revealed that all of the parents had experienced significant adverse events in their own childhoods, including trauma and losses. They also expressed intentions to offer parenting that was 'corrective' in terms of providing a better emotional environment for their children. Their corrective attempts and also intentions to repeat positive aspects of being parented were moderated by unconscious aspects of their early childhood experiences and also by the autistic features of their children. The interplay between early embodied experiences, theories of autism, parenting experiences and intentions is discussed along with clinical implications.

We explored the appropriateness and measurement properties of a suicidality assessment tool (SBQ-R) developed for the general population, in autistic adults-a high risk group for suicide. 188 autistic adults and 183 general population adults completed the tool online, and a sub-sample (n = 15) were interviewed while completing the tool. Multi-group factorial invariance analysis of the online survey data found evidence for metric non-invariance of the SBQ-R, particularly for items three (communication of suicidal intent) and four (likelihood of suicide attempt in the future). Cognitive interviews revealed that autistic adults did not interpret these items as intended by the tool designers. Results suggest autistic adults interpret key questions regarding suicide risk differently to the general population. Future research must adapt tools to better capture suicidality in autistic adults.

This study explored whether the Interpersonal Theory of suicide informs our understanding of high rates of suicidality in autistic adults. Autistic and non-autistic adults (n = 695, mean age 41.7 years, 58% female) completed an online survey of self-reported thwarted belonging, perceived burden, autistic traits, suicidal capability, trauma, and lifetime suicidality. Autistic people reported stronger feelings of perceived burden, thwarted belonging and more lifetime trauma than non-autistic people. The hypothesised interaction between burdensomeness and thwarted belonging were observed in the non-autistic group but not in the autistic group. In both groups autistic traits influenced suicidality through burdensomeness/thwarted belonging. Promoting self-worth and social inclusion are important for suicide prevention and future research should explore how these are experienced and expressed by autistic people.

"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component whose knowledge evolves quickly. Next-generation sequencing is the only effective technology to deal with the high genetic heterogeneity of ASD in a clinical setting. However, rigorous criteria to classify rare genetic variants conferring ASD susceptibility are currently lacking. We have performed whole-exome sequencing to identify both nucleotide variants and copy number variants (CNVs) in 253 ASD patients, including 68 patients with intellectual disability (ID) and 90 diagnosed as Asperger syndrome. Using explicit criteria to classify both susceptibility genes and susceptibility variants we prioritized 217 genes belonging to the following categories: syndromic genes, genes with an excess of de novo protein truncating variants and genes targeted by rare CNVs. We obtained a susceptibility variant detection rate of 19.7% (95% CI: [15-25.2%]). The rate for CNVs was 7.1% (95% CI: [4.3-11%]) and 12.6% (95% CI: [8.8-17.4%]) for nucleotide variants. The highest rate (30.1%, 95% CI: [20.2-43.2%]) was obtained in the ASD + ID subgroup. A strong contributor for at risk nucleotide variants was the recently identified set of genes (n = 81) harboring an excess of de novo protein truncating variants. Since there is currently no evidence that the genes targeted here are necessary and sufficient to cause ASD, we recommend to avoid the term ""causative of ASD"" when delivering the information about a variant to a family and to use instead the term ""genetic susceptibility factor contributing to ASD""."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex heterogeneous consortium of pervasive development disorders (PDD) which ranges from atypical autism, autism, and Asperger syndrome affecting brain in the developmental stage. This debilitating neurodevelopmental disorder results in both core as well as associated symptoms. Core symptoms observed in autistic patients are lack of social interaction, pervasive, stereotyped, and restricted behavior while the associated symptoms include irritability, anxiety, aggression, and several comorbid disorders.ASD is a polygenic disorder and is multifactorial in origin. Copy number variations (CNVs) of several genes that regulate the synaptogenesis and signaling pathways are one of the major factors responsible for the pathogenesis of autism. The complex integration of various CNVs cause mutations in the genes which code for molecules involved in cell adhesion, voltage-gated ion-channels, scaffolding proteins as well as signaling pathways (PTEN and mTOR pathways). These mutated genes are responsible for affecting synaptic transmission by causing plasticity dysfunction responsible, in turn, for the expression of ASD.Epigenetic modifications affecting DNA transcription and various pre-natal and post-natal exposure to a variety of environmental factors are also precipitating factors for the occurrence of ASD. All of these together cause dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling as well as imbalance in excitatory: inhibitory pathways resulting in glial cell activation and release of inflammatory mediators responsible for the aberrant social behavior which is observed in autistic patients.In this chapter we review and provide insight into the intricate integration of various genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors which play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder and the mechanistic approach behind this integration.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2020	Francesca Happé, Uta Frith	Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK. Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, London, UK.	The concept of autism is a significant contribution from child psychiatry that has entered wider culture and public consciousness, and has evolved significantly over the last four decades. Taking a rather personal retrospective, reflecting on our own time in autism research, this review explores changes in the concept of autism and the implications of these for future research. We focus on seven major changes in how autism is thought of, operationalised, and recognised: (1) from a narrow definition to wide diagnostic criteria; (2) from a rare to a relatively common condition, although probably still under-recognised in women; (3) from something affecting children, to a lifelong condition; (4) from something discreet and distinct, to a dimensional view; (5) from one thing to many 'autisms', and a compound or 'fractionable' condition; (6) from a focus on 'pure' autism, to recognition that complexity and comorbidity is the norm; and finally, (7) from conceptualising autism purely as a 'developmental disorder', to recognising a neurodiversity perspective, operationalised in participatory research models. We conclude with some challenges for the field and suggestions for areas currently neglected in autism research.

The Journal of nervous and mental disease	2020	Maria Nilsson, Peter Handest, Jessica Carlsson, Lena Nylander, Lennart Pedersen, Erik Lykke Mortensen, Sidse Arnfred		We explored subjective well-being in two groups of young adult participants diagnosed with either schizotypal disorder (Sd) (n = 29) or Asperger syndrome/autism spectrum disorder (As/ASD) (n = 22). Well-being was impaired in both groups and was lower in the Sd group than in the As/ASD group. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between well-being and the presence of self-disorders. The negative effect of self-disorders on well-being was still significant when adjusted for diagnosis, age and gender, and level of function. The present findings point toward clinically important disorder-specific differences in the nature of impaired well-being between the Sd group and the As/ASD group, as there seems to be a self-disorder-driven additional contribution to impaired subjective well-being within the schizophrenia spectrum. These findings further nuance the understanding of fundamental and clinically important qualitative differences between the schizophrenia spectrum and the autism spectrum.

31918613	doi: 10.1177/0033294119898120	A Matter of Perspective: An Exploratory Study of a Theory of Mind Autism Intervention for Adolescents.	Psychological reports	2021	Mishon Lecheler, Jon Lasser, Phillip W Vaughan, Jesi Leal, Kirstina Ordetx, Michelle Bischofberger	Pinnacle Academy, Bradenton, FL, USA. Texas State University, San Marcos, TX, USA.	Theory of Mind (ToM) is the capacity to make attributions of mental states such as thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of others. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder are often characterized by delayed or impaired Theory of Mind development and poor social skills. A positive correlation between Theory of Mind skills and social skills exists, but effective interventions that generalize these skills have proven to be a challenge in the field. Furthermore, few effective interventions exist to increase Theory of Mind skills in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. The Teaching Theory of Mind curriculum is a 12-week intervention aimed at increasing social understanding in children and adolescents with deficits in Theory of Mind. To date, there have not been any empirical studies to test the efficacy of the curriculum. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the Teaching Theory of Mind curriculum on adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and explore the impact of the intervention when addressing various domains of social understanding. Results, though tentative, indicated that parents saw improved social understanding following intervention, though direct measures of Theory of Mind with adolescent participants did not change significantly.

"Thomas is a 13-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder who presented for a follow-up to his developmental and behavioral pediatrician (DBP). His mother describes an increase in symptoms of anxiety and depression for the last 6 weeks, accompanied by suicidal ideation and thoughts of self-mutilation.Before this increase in symptoms, he had been doing well for the last several months with the exception of increasing weight gain, and Abilify was decreased from 5 mg to 2.5 mg at his last visit. Other medications at that time included Zoloft 100 mg twice daily, Focalin XR 40 mg every morning, and Focalin 5 mg every night. Without seeking the guidance of our developmental and behavioral pediatrics clinic, his mother increased his intake of Zoloft to 150 mg each morning and continued 100 mg each evening because of worsening anxiety and depression.Religion is very important to Thomas and his family. He acknowledges that he does not want to die and feels badly because ""suicide is against our religion.""Helping Thomas receive appropriate care has been a challenge. He was diagnosed with ADHD and Asperger disorder at the age of 5. Thomas is homeschooled and is very attached to his mother. His parents have very different parenting styles, with his mother being more permissive and his father more authoritarian. At the time of initial diagnosis, the behavioral health services (BHS) in Thomas' community, which is about an hour away from the DBP, were limited to older children, and he was followed by a DBP for ADHD medication management. At the age of 11, he expressed passive suicidal ideation and described that he imagined his mother as ""the devil with fire coming out of her eyes"" when she corrected him. He was evaluated by BHS, diagnosed with anxiety disorder, and started on Lexapro. BHS linked to the DBP were out of network for his insurance. The family was unable to pay out of pocket, so care was subsequently transferred to a DBP clinic that was in network. Soon after, Thomas developed auditory hallucinations, and Abilify was added after consultation with BHS.Over the last few years, Thomas' symptoms have waxed and waned. He did well for a short time and then again developed auditory hallucinations, worsening symptoms of anxiety and depression, and increasing somatic symptoms including vomiting and penile pain. Medications were adjusted with input from BHS, and further attempts were made to link him to local BHS but were unsuccessful. With his current concerns of suicidal ideation and self-mutilation, what would be your next steps?"

The contribution of mosaic alterations to tumors of the nervous system and to non-malignant neurological diseases has been unmasked thanks to the development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. We report here the case of a young patient without any remarkable familial medical history who was first referred at 7 years of age, for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) of Asperger type, not associated with macrocephaly. The patient subsequently presented at 10 years of age with multiple nodular lesions located within the trigeminal, facial and acoustic nerve ganglia and at the L3 level. Histological examination of this latter lesion revealed a glioneuronal hamartoma, exhibiting heterogeneous PTEN immunoreactivity, astrocyte and endothelial cell nuclei expressing PTEN, but not ganglion cells. NGS performed on the hamartoma allowed the detection of a PTEN pathogenic variant in 30% of the reads. The presence of this variant in the DNA extracted from blood and buccal swabs in 3.5 and 11% of the NGS reads, respectively, confirmed the mosaic state of the PTEN variant. The anatomical distribution of the lesions suggests that the mutational event affecting PTEN occurred in neural crest progenitors, thus explaining the absence of macrocephaly. This report shows that mosaic alteration of PTEN may result in multiple central and peripheral nervous system hamartomas and that the presence of such alteration should be considered in patients with multiple nervous system masses, even in the absence of cardinal features of PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, especially macrocephaly.

Escuela de Lenguas Modernas, Universidad de Costa Rica, Costa Rica.	Professional interventions for autistic people often encourage the development of neurotypical behavior. However, the pressure to appear or behave neurotypically has been associated with negative mental health outcomes. Consequently, autistic perspectives on the concept of neurotypicality are a critical area for empirical research. As a follow-up to a prior study on perceptions of autism, the present study examined the concept of neurotypicality as represented in 39 online video logs authored by YouTubers who self-identified as autistic. The study aimed to understand autistic perspectives on neurotypicality to guide professional service provision toward practices that support overall well-being.

Integrative psychological & behavioral science	2019	Alessandra Fasulo	Department of Psychology, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK. alessandra.fasulo@port.ac.uk.	Observations about peculiarities in the autistic population concerning type and frequency of references to subjective states, and lack of perspective taking, have been on the whole referred to as the paradox of the autistic self, i.e. a co-presence of ego-centeredness and weak self-referentiality (Lombardo & Baron Cohen 2010). Prevalent approaches in autism ascribe these peculiarities to high order disfunctions caused by neurological factors, such as defective self-encoding processes. Two narratives told by an adult man with Asperger during counselling are examined with Conversation Analysis; the analysis identifies features that may lead to descriptions like the paradox of autistic self, but also reveals competences related to perspective-taking and narrative construction. Drawing on Bruner's narrative theory, as well on recent interactional research on autism and the psychology of self, it is suggested that a relatively limited practice with narrative co-construction might be at the origin of the peculiarities observed. A socio-developmental approach to the understanding of autism not only can provide explanations compatible with first and second person accounts of life with autism, but can also open new paths for researching ways of self-construction that are less reliant on social interaction. The article finally challenges assumptions in psychological research about the ability of humans to access their internal states, and discusses how such assumptions can deter understanding of atypical populations.

Developmental neurobiology	2019	David A Geier, Janet K Kern, Mark R Geier	Institute of Chronic Illnesses, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which evidence reveals oxidative stress and transsulfuration pathway abnormalities. Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder characterized by similar oxidative stress and transsulfuration pathway abnormalities. This hypothesis-testing longitudinal cohort study determined whether transsulfuration abnormalities and oxidative stress are important susceptibility factors in ASD etiology by evaluating the rate of ASD diagnoses in DS as compared to the general population. The Independent Healthcare Research Database was analyzed for healthcare records prospectively generated in Florida Medicaid. A cohort of 101,736 persons (born: 1990-1999) with ≥10 outpatient office visits and continuously followed for 120 months after birth was examined. There were 942 children in the DS cohort (ICD-9 code: 758.0) and 100,749 children in the undiagnosed cohort (no DS diagnosis). ASD diagnoses were defined as autistic disorder (ICD-9 code: 299.00) or Asperger's disorder/pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (ICD-9 code: 299.80). ASDs were diagnosed in 5.31% of the DS cohort and 1.34% of the undiagnosed cohort. The risk ratio of being diagnosed with an ASD in the DS cohort as compared to the undiagnosed cohort was 3.97-fold significantly increased with a risk difference of 3.97%. Among children diagnosed with DS, less than 6% were also diagnosed with an ASD. Among children diagnosed with an ASD, less than 5% were also diagnosed with DS. Children diagnosed with DS are apparently more susceptible to ASD diagnosis relative to the general population suggesting oxidative stress and transsulfuration pathway abnormalities are important susceptibility factors in ASD.

Electronic address: luigi.degennaro@uniroma1.it. Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.	Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are often characterised by sleep problems, and recent evidence indicates alterations of the sleep electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations in these patients. Sleep microstructure plays a crucial role in cognitive functioning and brain maturation. In this view, modifications in sleep EEG oscillations in NDDs could further impair the cognitive maturation process in these patients. We provide an overview of sleep microstructure alterations observed in three NDDs without intellectual disabilities (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, high-functioning autism/Asperger syndrome and developmental dyslexia) and their relationships with the disorders' phenomenology. For each NDD, we discuss empirical evidence of altered EEG oscillations, and we consider their interaction with patients' cognitive and behavioural functioning, with the aim to elucidate their functional meaning. We highlight the limits of the present literature and propose possible future directions while underlining the clinical relevance of the research in this field. Beyond confirming the importance of sleep management in atypically developing children, the review findings suggest that sleep EEG oscillations in NDDs could become a target for specific clinical intervention.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2020	Shefaly Shorey, Esperanza D Ng, Gørill Haugan, Evelyn Law	Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Norway. National University of Singapore, Singapore. National University Hospital, Singapore.	"Parents of children with autism are faced with higher risks of unemployment, divorce, and poorer mental health than parents of children with other disorders. Such parenting stress can be further exacerbated by cultural and environmental factors such as the more conservative and collectivistic Asian values. Therefore, this review identifies and synthesizes literature on the parenting experiences and needs of Asian primary caregivers of children with autism using a critical interpretive method. A qualitative meta-summary was conducted. Seven electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase, ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched from each database's date of inception to November 2018. In total, 44 studies were included in this review. Thirteen studies examined Asian immigrant parents' experiences, and 31 studies were done among Asia-based parents. Six domains were identified: ""personal parenting journey""; ""adaptation and coping strategies""; ""family, community, and social support""; ""experiences with healthcare, education, and social services""; ""future hopes and recommendations""; and ""unique experiences of immigrants."" The distinctive influence of religious beliefs, cultural values, and environmental factors on Asian parenting experiences were discussed, and recommendations were proposed to better meet the needs of parents with autistic children."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2020	Olivia Smith, Sandra C Jones	ACU Engagement, Australian Catholic University, Sydney, Australia. sandra.jones@acu.edu.au. ACU Engagement, Australian Catholic University, Sydney, Australia.	Asperger's Syndrome was introduced as a separate diagnostic category in the DSM-4 (1994). Its subsequent absorption into autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5 (2013) led to vigorous debate and concerns about the loss of the unique Asperger's identity. Existing research has identified that adults previously diagnosed with Asperger's have expressed a diverse range of opinions regarding the DSM-5 changes. This Australian study explored the role of disability identity development in responses to the change through semi-structured interviews with 12 adults diagnosed with Asperger's under the DSM-4. Their different views did not appear to be a function of demographic variables; a connection was identified between participants' views of the change and differing stages of integration with the Asperger's and/or autism identities.

Electronic address: C.S.Allely@salford.ac.uk.	This paper examines how the symptomology of the small number of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) charged with online sexual offenses in Australia is established during legal arguments and conceived by the judiciary to impact legal liability and offending behavior. This study aims to provide empirical support for the proposition that judicial discourses regarding the connection between ASD and online sexual offending, including conduct related to child exploitation material (CEM), have little bearing on overall questions of criminal liability or the use of alternative penal dispositions. It does so by exploring a sample of nine recent Australian criminal cases, involving ten rulings, that examine how evidence of ASD is raised in legal arguments in ways that suggest a diagnosed condition may have contributed significantly to the alleged wrongdoing. We conclude by suggesting current Australian judicial practice requires more sensitivity to the impact of clinical factors associated with ASD in shaping alternative supervisory and non-custodial dispositions for individuals convicted of online sexual offenses.

An increasing number of students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) enroll in inclusive schools and classrooms. The aim of this study was to research how students with ASD experience the social aspect of inclusive high schools. Five adolescences with Asperger syndrome were interviewed, and the results show that high school was perceived as an important platform for social training, and an equally important place to find new friends and acquaintances. A majority of the participants had experienced loneliness and bullying in junior high school. However, they experienced high school as a new start, with a more open and inclusive environment. Nevertheless, several of the participants expressed that they used quite a lot of energy on social settings, such as interpreting social situations and on being amongst a larger group of students. In order to support this group of adolescents in their schooling, it is important to look at their strength and resources, and not only focus on the challenges and difficulties.

With the exception of a low Cognitive alpha in the AUT group, internal consistency reliabilities ranged from moderate to high. Significant between-group mean differences were observed for all scores. Receiver operating characteristic analyses indicated Area Under the Curve in the fair range (.71). Cutoff points and interpretation are discussed. The ASDS appears most useful in cases of either low or high scores or as an adjuvant to gold-standard measures.

"Here, we describe a case in which an original diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Asperger's syndrome was later adapted to social communication disorder, to meet the new guidelines. First, separate diagnostic labels of autism disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD-NOS have been replaced by one umbrella term ""autism spectrum disorder"". Second, the new DSM-5 criteria are more stringent than the old criteria. For example, observation of a higher number of symptoms is necessary to meet the criteria, such as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors. Third, the communication and social interaction domains are combined into one, titled ""social/communication deficits."" Finally, requirement of a delay in language development is no longer necessary to establish a diagnosis of autism."

Institute of Psychology II, University of Lübeck, Lübeck, Germany. Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School, Hanover, Germany. Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.	Audiovisual (AV) integration deficits have been proposed to underlie difficulties in speech perception in Asperger's syndrome (AS). It is not known, if the AV deficits are related to alterations in sensory processing at the level of unisensory processing or at levels of conjoint multisensory processing. Functional Magnetic-resonance images (MRI) was performed in 16 adult subjects with AS and 16 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, gender, and verbal IQ as they were exposed to disyllabic AV congruent and AV incongruent nouns. A simple semantic categorization task was used to ensure subjects' attention to the stimuli. The left auditory cortex (BA41) showed stronger activation in HC than in subjects with AS with no interaction regarding AV congruency. This suggests that alterations in auditory processing in unimodal low-level areas underlie AV speech perception deficits in AS. Whether this is signaling a difficulty in the deployment of attention remains to be demonstrated.

Keck School of Medicine, Pediatrics University of Southern California Los Angeles, USA.	Play in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is often atypical, yet consensus regarding effective occupational therapy strategies for improving play is not established. To examine the efficacy of strategies used in occupational therapy to improve play in ASD, authors completed a systematic review of papers from January 1980 through January 2019. Search terms included autism, Asperger's, ASD, autistic in combination with play, playfulness, pretend, imagination, praxis, creativity, and generativity. Twenty papers met inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Reviewed interventions included parent education, modified play materials or environments, imitation of the child, and modeling by an adult, a peer, or video. Moderate to strong support exists for the specific strategies of imitation of the child and modeling for the child, with lesser or mixed support for other strategies. Certain strategies commonly used in occupational therapy may be effective in improving the occupation of play in ASD.

Department of Neuroscience, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome, Italy. Department of Anatomical, Histological, Forensic and Orthopedic Sciences, ""Sapienza"" University of Rome."	This systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aims at evaluating the efficacy of Occupational therapy (OT) interventions in Asperger's syndrome (AS) pediatric patients. We conducted a systematic review according to PRISMA guidelines. The screening of the literature was carried out on PUBMED, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE and OT SEEKER databases, TO December 2018. We selected three RCTs having the common objective to evaluate whether children with AS can improve their social skills thanks to OT treatments. The interventions targeted by the three selected studies were: LEGO therapy, Social Use of Language Programme, Let's Face It! software and Parent Training combined with the administration of risperidone. All the studies showed that the intervention groups improved their overall social ability.This review shows that OT interventions can help concretely AS children in overcoming their social issues. Nevertheless, more RCTs are needed to better understand the OT's benefits and limitations in AS patients.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2020	Murat Coskun, Aydan Hajdini, Alper Alnak, Ali Karayagmurlu	Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Istanbul Medicine Faculty, Istanbul University, Fatih, 34116, Istanbul, Turkey. Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Istanbul Medicine Faculty, Istanbul University, Fatih, 34116, Istanbul, Turkey. drmc78@gmail.com.	We aimed to investigate the characteristics of internet use in a clinical sample of 60 young subjects with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and its relationship with parental control and psychiatric comorbidity. Of the participants, 38.3% were classified as having problematic internet use (PIU). Subjects with normal internet use (NIU), compared to the subjects with PIU, had significantly higher scores on parental control scale. While there was no significant difference in terms of any comorbid diagnoses between subjects with NIU versus PIU, severity of depressive symptoms was found to predict higher scores on Young Internet Addiction Scale (YIAS). In conclusion, PIU may be common in AS and may be associated with internalizing problems, while parental control may protect against it.

This study examined the perception of an ASD label compared to Asperger's syndrome or no diagnosis. Seventy-one undergraduates read an adapted vignette (Ohan et al. J Autism Dev Disord 45:3384-3389, 2015) about an undergraduate with ASD, Asperger's Syndrome, or No Diagnosis. Participants also completed questionnaires. More positive ratings emerged for the Asperger's and ASD labels than No Diagnosis in low contact scenarios, particularly when involving greater social versus professional interaction. In contrast, more positive ratings emerged for the Asperger's compared to the ASD and No Diagnosis on high contact items. Ratings between low and high contact items differed only for ASD. Results demonstrate the impact of diagnostic labels across social contexts and support the need for education surrounding changes in nosology.

Neuropsychiatric Rehabilitation and Medical Center, NeuroMental, Helsinki, Finland.	"We examined the emotional and psychophysiological underpinnings of social interaction in the context of autism spectrum disorder, more specifically, involving participants diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (AS). We recorded participants' autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation (electrodermal activity, heart rate, and heart rate variability) and facial muscle activation during conversations in two different types of male dyads: (1) ten dyads where one participant has been diagnosed with AS (AS/NT dyads) and (2) nine dyads where both participants are neurotypical (NT/NT dyads). Afterwards, three independent raters assessed continuously each participant's affiliative and dominant behaviors during the first and last 10 minutes of the conversations. The relationship between the assessed data and ANS responses was examined. We found that, in the NT/NT dyads, a high level of affiliation displayed by the conversational partner calms down the participant when they are actively dominating the interaction. In contrast, when the participants themselves expressed affiliation, their psychophysiological responses indicated increase in arousal, which suggests that the giving of affiliation is physiologically ""hard work."" The affiliation-related ANS responses were similar in those NT participants whose conversational partner had AS, while some differences in facial muscle activation did occur in comparison to NT/NT dyads. In the AS participants, in contrast, a high level of affiliation provided by the conversational partner was associated with increase in arousal, suggesting heightened alertness and stress. As for their own affiliative behavior, the AS participants exhibited similar indicators of alertness and stress as the NT participants, but only when their own level of dominance was low. Our results increase understanding of how individuals with AS experience social interaction at the physiological level, and how this experience differs from that in NT individuals. Moreover, our results confirm and further specify our earlier results, where we proposed that affiliation involves the type of ""sharing of the burden"" that also reverberates in the participants' bodies."

These pregnancies are, however, more at risk of psychiatric, obstetrical and neonatal complications (increased risks of post-partum depression, relapse, suicide, gestational diabetes, placental abnormalities or low birth weight). Midwives often feel isolated and resourceless when taking care of these women. Specialized units such as mother-infant psychiatric units or the Transversal Unit of Perinatal Care (UTAP) in the Grenoble Alpes University Hospital (CHUGA) enhance the coordination between psychiatric and obstetrical teams and have shown effectiveness in improving maternal and child outcomes.

A 24-year-old man, who had been treated for 3 years as Asperger syndrome in adolescence due to behavioral disturbances, lack of social awareness and inability to socialize, was referred to our hospital shortly after tremors developed. On the basis of clinical features, laboratory findings and the brain MRI, a diagnosis of Wilson's disease (WD) was made. WD was further confirmed by genetic testing (the mutation of ATP7B gene). He was started with trientine hydrochloride 500 mg/day, and after 1 year of follow-up, his psychiatric symptoms have improved. Since psychiatric symptoms may precede the neurological symptoms, the possibility of WD should be always considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in young adults.

34908951		Autism as a Disruption of Affective Contact: The Forgotten Role of George Frankl.	Clinical neuropsychiatry	2019	Filippo Muratori, Valeria Bizzari	University of Pisa, Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Stella Maris. Clinic University of Heidelberg, Department of Psychiatry, Center of Psychosocial Medicine.	The simultaneous description of autism by Asperger in Vienna and Kanner in Baltimore is usually considered a strange coincidence. Here we propose that the Jewish psychiatrist Georg Frankl, who worked with both Asperger and Kanner, had more than a marginal role in the early history of autism. While Hans Asperger did not recognize the talent of his superior Georg Frankl, Leo Kanner immediately recognized his merits and acumen when Georg Frankl arrived at the Johns Hopkins as a refugee. This proposal is supported by the retrieval of an unpublished Frankl's manuscript on autism which is here analysed and that deserves credit for anticipating some of the contemporary visions of autism. The manuscript deepens the distinction between 'affective language' and 'word language' that George Frankl had already developed in his previous papers in 1933 and 1943. While in neurotypical subjects the everyday language is an integration of affective and word language, autistic children register a break between them and, according to Frankl, this break is at the core of autism and can have a wide range of expression and tentatives of compensation. It is also proposed that the centrality of disturbances in affective language can be in agreement with a vision of autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder that interferes with the current notions of intersubjectivity, intercorporeality and interaffectivity. Frankl's perspective about autism can still be considered innovative today for other reasons. He proposed that autism could cover a spectrum of conditions; that it is a state of mind that is not necessarily abnormal; that it is a neurobiological condition that needs to be understood by others before of being modified. Finally the conceptualization of autism as a disturbance of affective language is in agreement with the DSM-5 which has created a sociocommunicative domain that comprises only deficits in non-verbal communication (that is affective language), putting the verbal language (that is word language) as a specificator outside the diagnostic criteria.

Journal of applied behavior analysis	2020	Charlotte C Mann, Amanda M Karsten	Western New England University.	Better conversational skills correspond to a higher quality of life for adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study, we taught vocal-verbal responses discriminated by compound arrangements of concealed conversation partner mands to two college students with ASD. Participants learned to engage in self-questioning about their conversation partner's behavior and to reinforce three concealed mands for termination of an aversive conversation scenario. We assessed generalization to conversation probes with trained confederates and to interactions with untrained conversational partners (e.g., peers, professors). Finally, we collected peer ratings of the social validity of changes in conversational behavior as well as participants' ratings of study goals, procedures, and outcomes.

Applied Computer technologies can address the needs of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Data on the efficacy of assistive technology in ASD is limited, and its effectiveness in supporting and facilitating skill acquisition in this specific population must be still demonstrated. 63 Italian ASD subjects underwent learning activities administered by cardboards or a touch screen support. The support preference was evaluated in a choice trial, and quantitative analysis was performed on items regarding communication and challenging behaviours. Touch devices are attractive especially for males without intellectual disability and a lower communication and cooperation behaviours with the use of touch screen compared with paper support was shown depending on activities. Overall, our data do not confirm the hypothesis that touch screen presentation improves activity completion and behavioural performance for each individual with ASD. Data discourage an indiscriminate use of these devices and suggest analysing with more attention the core ingredients that should shape digital devices when used for people on ASD.

Case reports in psychiatry	2019	Claudia Carmassi, Carlo Antonio Bertelloni, Gianluca Salarpi, Elisa Diadema, Maria Teresa Avella, Valerio Dell'Oste, Liliana Dell'Osso	Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.	This case report highlights the relevance of the consequences of trauma in a female patient with an undetected autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affected by bipolar disorder (BD) with multiple comorbidities. A 35-year-old woman with BD type II, binge eating disorder and panic disorder was admitted in the Inpatient Unit of the Psychiatric Clinic of the University of Pisa because of a recrudescence of depressive symptomatology, associated with increase of anxiety, noticeable ruminations, significant alteration in neurovegetative pattern, and serious suicide ideation. During the hospitalization, a diagnosis of ASD emerged besides a history of childhood trauma and affective dysregulation, marked impulsivity, feeling of emptiness, and self-harm behavior. The patient was assessed by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale (RAADS-R), the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), Trauma and Loss Spectrum (TALS-SR), and Ruminative Response Scale (RRS). Total scores of 38/50 in the AQ, 146/240 in the RAADS-R, 99/160 in the AdAS Spectrum emerged, compatible with ASD, 47/116 in the TALS-SR, and 64/88 in the RRS. We discuss the implications of the trauma she underwent during her childhood, in the sense that caused a complex posttraumatic disorder, a lifelong disease favored and boosted by the rumination tendency of high functioning ASD.

Falk's paper, which relies heavily on online translation software, does not contain a single relevant piece of new evidence, but abounds with mistranslations, misrepresentations of the content of sources, and basic factual errors, and omits everything that does not support the author's agenda of defending Hans Asperger's record. The paper should never have passed peer review and, in view of the academic credibility of all parties concerned, it should be retracted."

Czech's claims that my paper abounds with mistranslations, misrepresentations, and factual errors are refuted point-by-point, as is his declaration that the paper contains no relevant or new evidence. Asperger's statements that Franz Hamburger saved him from the Gestapo are reaffirmed and supported with a personal communication from Asperger's daughter, Dr. Maria Asperger Felder. Czech's criticism of anonymous peer reviewers and his call for retraction of my paper are, at best, unconstructive. In light of the current resurgence of authoritarian governments that promote xenophobic and racist ideology in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, it is essential that details about the Nazi euthanasia program continue to be recalled and deliberated, as they are in this exchange. I stand by my paper.

Difficulties in social cognition are present both in persons with schizophrenia (SCZ) and persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, qualitative similarities and differences in this field remain unclear. The aim of this study was to explore attribution of intentionality in patients with recent onset SCZ in comparison to patients with high functioning ASD, and to explore relationships between alterations in attribution and clinical profile. Animated shapes are a non-verbal Theory of Mind (ToM) task involving the interpretation of geometric figure interactions in three conditions: random, goal-directed and ToM. We compared 51 young adults with SCZ, 32 with ASD and 23 healthy controls (HC) matched for age and gender. In random, goal-directed and ToM conditions, persons with SCZ attributed less intentionality with less appropriate answers than HC, while the same anomalies were only found in the ToM condition in persons with ASD. In SCZ, thought and langage disorganization and earlier age at onset were correlated with intentionality score in the random condition. Moreover, a mixed ToM impairment was found in SCZ, combining undermentalizing (for movements involving a mental state) similar to what was found in ASD, and overmentalizing (for random movements), related to dizorganization and precocity of the first psychotic episode. In the frame of the hypothesis of a continuum, these results underline both similarities and differences between autism and schizophrenia.

Empathy is an essential component of human social life. It requires the ability to understand another's mental state and respond with an appropriate emotion or action. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been described to exhibit atypical empathic responses which limit communication and social interactions. This review highlights the clinical characteristics and mechanisms underlying empathy in ASD by summarizing 61 peer-reviewed articles. Studies characterized empathic differences due to sex, age, intelligence, and disorder severity and provided valuable insights into the roles that genetics, neural networks, and sensory processing have in eliciting empathy. This knowledge will lead to improved diagnostics and therapies to improve social cognition, emotional recognition, and the empathic response in patients with ASD.

Discrepancies in efficacy between single-dose and repeated administration of oxytocin for autism spectrum disorder have led researchers to hypothesize that time-course changes in efficacy are induced by repeated administrations of the peptide hormone. However, repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of autism spectrum disorder's core symptoms are lacking, making it difficult to examine potential time-course changes in efficacy. We tested this hypothesis using repeatable, objective, and quantitative measurement of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. We examined videos recorded during semi-structured social interaction administered as the primary outcome in single-site exploratory (n = 18, crossover within-subjects design) and multisite confirmatory (n = 106, parallel-group design), double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week trials of repeated intranasal administrations of oxytocin (48 IU/day) in adult males with autism spectrum disorder. The main outcomes were statistical representative values of objectively quantified facial expression intensity in a repeatable part of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: the maximum probability (i.e. mode) and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression and the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of happy expression. Our recent study revealed that increases in these indices characterize autistic facial expression, compared with neurotypical individuals. The current results revealed that oxytocin consistently and significantly decreased the increased natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression compared with placebo in exploratory (effect-size, -0.57; 95% CI, -1.27 to 0.13; P = 0.023) and confirmatory trials (-0.41; -0.62 to -0.20; P < 0.001). A significant interaction between time-course (at baseline, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks) and the efficacy of oxytocin on the natural logarithm of mode on the probability density function of neutral facial expression was found in confirmatory trial (P < 0.001). Post hoc analyses revealed maximum efficacy at 2 weeks (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.78; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.35) and deterioration of efficacy at 4 weeks (P = 0.042, Cohen's d = -0.46; 95% CI, -0.90 to -0.01) and 6 weeks (P = 0.10, Cohen's d = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.77 to 0.08), while efficacy was preserved at 2 weeks post-treatment (i.e. 8 weeks) (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = -1.24; 95% CI, -1.71 to -0.78). Quantitative facial expression analyses successfully verified the positive effects of repeated oxytocin on autistic individuals' facial expressions and demonstrated a time-course change in efficacy. The current findings support further development of an optimized regimen of oxytocin treatment.

There are historical and theoretical indications of a difference in subjective experience between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the schizophrenia spectrum. However, this difference has not been empirically explored. Therefore, to explore potential differences in subjective experience between the 2 spectra, we examined the presence/absence of self-disorders in Asperger syndrome/autism spectrum disorder (As/ASD) compared to schizotypal disorder (Sd). Self-disorders represent changes in basic self-awareness which have been found to accumulate within the schizophrenia spectrum.

Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. Scott.Jackson@yale.edu.	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often have co-morbid anxiety and depression. Alexithymia and emotion regulation difficulties are commonly seen in individuals with ASD and in mood disorders. We hypothesized that alexithymia and emotional regulation would mediate the relationship between autistic features and anxiety/depression symptom severity. We collected data about emotional regulation, alexithymia, autistic symptoms and depression/anxiety in a sample of 64 young adults with ASD. We constructed two serial multiple mediator models, using autistic features as the independent variable and anxiety/depression symptoms as outcome variables. The serial relationship between alexithymia and emotional regulation mediated associations between autistic features and depression and anxiety, separately. The findings suggest that targeting alexithymia may benefit therapies designed to alleviate mood disorders in ASD.

Three phase 2 trials were conducted to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of weight-based memantine extended release (ER) treatment in children with autism spectrum disorder. MEM-MD-91, a 50-week open-label trial, identified memantine extended-release treatment responders for enrollment into MEM-MD-68, a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal trial. MEM-MD-69 was an open-label extension trial in which participants from MEM-MD-68, MEM-MD-91, and open-label trial MEM-MD-67 were treated ⩽48 weeks with memantine extended release. In MEM-MD-91, 517 (59.6%) participants were confirmed Social Responsiveness Scale responders at week 12; mean Social Responsiveness Scale total raw scores improved two to three times a minimal clinically important difference of 10 points. In MEM-MD-68, there was no difference between memantine and placebo on the primary efficacy parameter, the proportion of patients with a loss of therapeutic response (defined as ⩾10-point increase from baseline in Social Responsiveness Scale total raw score). MEM-MD-69 exploratory analyses revealed mean standard deviation improvement in Social Responsiveness Scale total raw score of 32.4 (26.4) from baseline of the first lead-in study. No new safety concerns were evident. While the a priori-defined efficacy results of the double-blind trial were not achieved, the considerable improvements in mean Social Responsiveness Scale scores from baseline in the open-label trials were presumed to be clinically important.

"Peter is a 26-year-old group home resident in Austria with a history of poor peer relationships, including being bullied, and previous diagnoses of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, Asperger syndrome, social anxiety, depression, and developmental coordination disorder. Consultation from our international neurodevelopmental team was requested for severe anxiety and avoidance of social interactions. He reported 4 or more spontaneous anxiety episodes per day. Anxiety triggers included returning to his group home from his vocational rehabilitation program each evening or returning to the group home after weekends at his parents' house. Each Sunday evening, in anticipation of returning to the group home, Peter engaged in tantrums, including screaming and throwing objects and suicidal threats without intent, but not direct aggression toward family members. He phoned his mother several times per day on weekdays.Peter's early history was significant for hyperactivity, impulsivity, aggression, and socially intrusive behavior; he repeated kindergarten and by first grade was characterized as motorically clumsy and ""too much in [peers'] personal space."" He played alone in kindergarten and had poor social boundaries; when older, he evidenced reduced social perception, and his family reported he did not notice when peers made fun of him. His language developed normally, but he had a ""sophisticated style of speaking"" and as an adult continued to have trouble understanding gestures, jokes, and social themes in movies.Between ages 7 and 11 years, Peter had been bullied and ostracized by male peers but did well academically, always got along well with adults, and preferred to play with girls. Exclusion by peers persisted through high school, at which time his independent functioning declined and he required his mother's assistance with organizing his materials. At age 15 years, Peter repeated a grade so that he could change classmates, and by the equivalent of his junior year, his grades deteriorated. He had several psychiatric admissions for depression and destructive outbursts (to avoid going to school) and was diagnosed with Asperger disorder. At age 18 years, Peter refused to return to school. He lived at home with his parents, only leaving the house to accompany them on errands, until placed in a group home for people with mental health disorders at age 20 years. At age 26 years, he is sharing a supported-living apartment with 2 young adults with chronic psychiatric disorders. He works in 3 highly structured sheltered workshops for a few hours each and becomes easily overwhelmed in unstructured situations and/or in situations in which he anticipates being reprimanded or letting someone down. Despite a strong interest in marine biology, anxiety prevents him from considering college.How would you proceed with diagnostic testing or intervention to help this young man?"

Research Department of Experimental Psychology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK. Research Department of Clinical, Educational and Health Psychology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, UK.	In this study, three hundred and sixty-eight participants answered a questionnaire consisting of three vignettes describing a person with depression, severe Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and high-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder/Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Each vignette was followed by thirteen questions concerning the participant's knowledge about diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. Participants demonstrated good mental health literacy (MHL) for depression, but were poor at diagnosing ASD. Drug therapy was rated as the least effective treatment and 'talking to a family member of friend' was rated as the most effective for each disorder. The highest prognosis ratings were given to depression, and the lowest given to ASD. Participants demonstrated better MHL than expected, possibly due to the availability of information on the Internet and the increase in prevalence of mental illnesses such as depression and ASD among the general population.

American journal of speech-language pathology	2019	Henry Angulo-Jiménez, Laura DeThorne	Department of Speech and Hearing Science, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.	Purpose The goal of this study was to expand the field's understanding of autism through the analysis of 1st-person perspectives from autistic video webloggers (vloggers). Method This study analyzed the representation of autism in 39 YouTube videos authored by self-identified autistic individuals and published between 2007 and 2015. Consistent with the cross-disciplinary tradition of narrative inquiry, thematic analyses of the video transcripts were conducted. Findings Vloggers were predominantly, but not exclusively, White male adults who spoke mainstream American English and self-identified as experiencing Asperger's syndrome. Key findings included (a) the predominance of a narrative about autism that incorporated features of both the medical model of disability and the neurodiversity paradigm to varying degrees, (b) a trend toward more medical model features across most content areas, and (c) a relatively high prevalence of neurodiversity paradigm features related specifically to language use and the description of autistic traits. Conclusions Implications include the need for clinicians to (a) familiarize themselves with the varying views of autism held within the autistic community, (b) reflect on the language used to talk about autism and listen to how clients and/or their caregivers talk about it, and (c) consider the exploration of potential positive dimensions of autistic traits.

"In this work, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is applied for nonlinear dimensionality reduction and visualization of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data. We evaluate the performance of the UMAP algorithm on MSI data sets acquired in mouse pancreas and human lymphoma samples and compare it to those of principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and the Barnes-Hut (BH) approximation of t-SNE. Furthermore, we compare different distance metrics in (BH) t-SNE and UMAP and propose the use of spatial autocorrelation as a means of comparing the resulting low-dimensional embeddings. The results indicate that UMAP is competitive with t-SNE in terms of visualization and is well-suited for the dimensionality reduction of large (>100 000 pixels) MSI data sets. With an almost fourfold decrease in runtime, it is more scalable in comparison with the current state-of-the-art: t-SNE or the Barnes-Hut approximation of t-SNE. In what seems to be the first application of UMAP to MSI data, we assess the value of applying alternative distance metrics, such as the correlation, cosine, and the Chebyshev metric, in contrast to the traditionally used Euclidean distance metric. Furthermore, we propose ""histomatch"" as an additional custom distance metric for the analysis of MSI data."

Motor functions are frequently impaired in Asperger syndrome (AS). In this study, we examined the motor cortex structure and function using navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and correlated the results with the box and block test (BBT) of manual dexterity and physical activity in eight boys with AS, aged 8-11 years, and their matched controls. With nTMS, we found less focused cortical representation areas of distinct hand muscles in AS. There was hemispheric asymmetry in the motor maps, silent period duration and active MEP latency in the AS group, but not in controls. Exploratory VBM analysis revealed less gray matter in the left postcentral gyrus, especially in the face area, and less white matter in the precentral area in AS as compared to controls. On the contrary, in the right leg area, subjects with AS displayed an increased density of gray matter. The structural findings of the left hemisphere correlated negatively with BBT score in controls, whereas the structure of the right hemisphere in the AS group correlated positively with motor function as assessed by BBT. These preliminary functional (neurophysiological and behavioral) findings are indicative of asymmetry, and co-existing structural alterations may reflect the motor impairments causing the deteriorations in manual dexterity and other motor functions commonly encountered in children with AS.

Institute for Sex Research and Forensic Psychiatry, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. briken@uke.de.	Adults with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, repetitive and stereotyped interests and behaviours as well as hyper- and/or hyposensitivities. These disorder specific symptoms could be associated with the development of sexual disorders. The Dual Control Model of Sexual Response presents one approach that is frequently used to explain the emergence of sexual dysfunctions. The aim of the present study was to assess the extent of symptoms of sexual dysfunctions in men and women with ASD and to evaluate their association with the individual propensity of sexual excitation and inhibition as defined by the Dual Control Model. Both men and women with ASD were more likely to report about sexual dysfunctions than individuals from the control group. In men with ASD, sexual inhibition was significantly correlated with the emergence of sexual dysfunctions, while there was no association between sexual functioning and sexual excitation. In women, the opposite pattern was found. Especially the peculiarities in sensitive perception could be responsible for the observed problems with sexual functioning in individuals with ASD. The present findings highlight the great need for specialized treatment programs addressing the frequently observed sexuality-related problems in individuals with ASD. However, up to now such treatment programs are lacking.

"Recent allegations that pediatrician Hans Asperger legitimized Nazi policies, including forced sterilization and child euthanasia, are refuted with newly translated and chronologically-ordered information that takes into account Hitler's deceptive 'halt' to the T4 euthanasia program in 1941. It is highly unlikely that Asperger was aware of the T4 program when he referred Herta Schreiber to Am Spiegelgrund or when he mentioned that institution 4 months later on the medical chart of another (unrelated) girl, Elisabeth Schreiber. Asperger campaigned vigorously from 1938 to 1943 to have his specialization, Curative Education, take priority in the diagnosis and treatment of disabled children over other fields that promoted Nazi racial hygiene policies. He neither disparaged his patients nor was he sexist. By 1938, he had identified the essentials of Asperger syndrome and described an unnamed boy whom he later profiled (as Ernst K.) in 1944. Rather than doing 'thin' research, Asperger made discoveries that were prescient, and some of his activities conformed to definitions of ""individual resistance."""

"In this paper, nanostructured TiO₂ film was prepared by the by sol-gel process and dip-coating technique with titanium tetraisopropoxide as a precursor. After heat treatment at 550 °C, the deposited film was characterized by means of micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found that the TiO₂ film consisted of only the TiO₂ anatase phase and showed a granular microstructure. Photocatalytic degradation of azithromycin by using sol-gel nanostructured TiO₂ film was studied to define the most effective degradation process for potential use in wastewater treatment. Different factors were evaluated during photocatalysis, such as pH (3, 7, and 10), water matrix (ultrapure water and synthetic municipal waste water effluent), influence of another pharmaceutically active compound (sulfamethoxazole, one of the most often detected pharmaceutic compounds in waste waters), and radiation sources (low pressure ultraviolet (UV) mercury lamps with a UV-A and UV-C range; a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp with a radiation peak at 365 nm). The most effective degradation process was achieved with the UV-C irradiation source in matrices at pH 10. The water matrix had little effect on the photocatalytic degradation rates of azithromycin. The presence of sulfamethoxazole in the water matrix decreased the degradation rate of azithromycin, however, only in matrices with a pH level adjusted to 10. During the experiments, five azithromycin degradation products were identified and none of them showed toxic properties, suggesting effective removal of azithromycin. LED 365 nm as the irradiation source was not as effective as the UV-C lamp. Nevertheless, considering the cost, energy efficiency, and environmental aspects of the irradiation source, the LED lamp could be a ""real-life"" alternative."

Functional connectivity between different regions of the brain in the resting state has been a recent topic of interest in neurophysiological research. EEG coherence happened to be an useful tool for measuring changes in neuro-psycho-physiological functioning which are not detectable by simply measuring amplitude or power spectra. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes in the EEG coherence in groups of different mental disorders such as: depression, general anxiety disorder, ADHD, Asperger syndrome and headaches, compared to control group. All measures were made in two conditions: eye opened (EO) and eyes closed (EC). The obtained results show that in EO condition there is a significantly lower coherence for delta waves between analyzed groups. For theta coherence only for Asperger syndrome we found lower coherence compared to control group, ADHD and headaches in parietal region (P3-P4). Obtained results for intrahemispheric coherence have shown that there was significantly lower coherence in both conditions for delta and theta bands in almost all sites for Asperger's syndrome, and opposite increased intrahemispheric coherence for patients with headaches (for delta band in the anterior regions and for theta band in the posterior regions). ADHD patients expressed lower delta inter-hemispheric coherence in frontal regions, and increased coherence of theta in central regions but increased delta coherence in posterior regions only in EO condition. For depressive and anxiety patients we found decreased intrahemispheric coherence for EO condition for delta brain waves all over the cortex. Concerning the coherence in anxiety patients in our current study we have obtained hypo coherence in centro-parieto-occipital region only for delta in inter-hemispheric coherence and also lower delta coherence through the cortex for intrahemispheric coherence. Our findings for interhemispheric hyper coherence in subjects with depression specifically for alpha and beta bands were confirmed in other studies. We suggest that EEG coherence analysis could be a sensitive parameter in the detection of electrophysiological abnormalities in patients with anxiety, depression, ADHD, Asperger syndrome and headaches. These results can confirm the development of QEEG state and trait biomarkers for psychiatric disorders.

We conducted a 5-year follow-up systematic review and meta-analysis to determine change in frequency of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis since diagnostic and statistical manual 5 (DSM-5) publication and explore the impact of Social Communication Disorder (SCD). For 33 included studies, use of DSM-5 criteria suggests decreases in diagnosis for ASD [20.8% (16.0-26.7), p < 0.001], DSM-IV-TR Autistic Disorder [10.1% (6.2-16.0), p < 0.001], and Asperger's [23.3% (12.9-38.5), p = 0.001]; pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified decrease was not significant [46.1% (34.6-58.0), p = 0.52]. Less than one-third [28.8% (13.9-50.5), p = 0.06] of individuals diagnosed with DSM-IV-TR but not DSM-5 ASD would qualify for SCD. Findings suggest smaller decreases in ASD diagnoses compared to earlier reviews. Future research is needed as concerns remain for impaired individuals without a diagnosis.

E-mail: neuropediatria.huca@gmail.com. Unidad de Neurología Infantil, Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, España.	Autism spectrum disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders that share the presence of two core symptoms: problems in social interaction / communication and the tendency to present restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Over the last years, several epidemiologic studies have been published by different authors in diverse countries, having all of them shown two common characteristics: a global increase in the prevalence rates of autism spectrum disorders, and the existence of a great geographical variability no only between geographical areas, but also within the same geographical areas. At the present manuscript, we analyze some of the most recent prevalence data published in USA and some European countries (including Spain). All of them show different prevalence rates, ranging from 1/59 children with autism spectrum disorders in the USA to 1/806 in Portugal. In a second part, we briefly describe some of the current scientific hypotheses that try to explain this variability.

Department of Neurology, Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA. fhd@sover.net.	Autism prevalence continues to grow, yet a universally agreed upon etiology is lacking despite manifold evidence of abnormalities especially in terms of genetics and epigenetics. The authors postulate that the broad definition of an omnibus 'spectrum disorder' may inhibit delineation of meaningful clinical correlations. This paper presents evidence that an objectively defined, EEG based brain measure may be helpful in illuminating the autism spectrum versus subgroups (clusters) question.

Irish journal of psychological medicine	2022	L Alexander, N Farrelly	St Vincent's Hospital Fairview, Fairview, Dublin, Ireland. College Health Centre, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is frequently identified in children but is often unrecognised in adults. ASD is characterised by difficulties in social interaction, communication and restricted interests, but other presentations are common, especially in adults. This report describes a 34-year-old man with a history of multiple psychiatric diagnoses including generalised anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder and panic disorder. He was diagnosed with ASD in his early 30s and engaged in a targeted treatment plan, including rationalisation of medications, supportive therapy and occupational therapy, which successfully facilitated discharge from mental health services. This case illustrates the atypical presentation of ASD in adults, which is diagnostically challenging. Such cases often present to community mental health services and may be misdiagnosed as treatment resistant cases of depressive, anxiety or personality disorders. Accurate diagnosis and targeted management is more likely to yield a successful outcome.

Asperger's syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder which is part of the large family of autism spectrum disorders. People with Asperger's syndrome have difficulties in social interactions, verbal and non-verbal communication, and may display behavioural oddities, with stereotypies and limited interests. They show no language delay and their cognitive development is not marked by an overall delay but by specific impairments in certain areas such as the executive functions. The clinical presentations are very heterogeneous, varying according to age and psychiatric comorbidities. Screening, diagnosis and specialized treatment are not made any easier by the diversity of the clinical manifestations. Asperger's syndrome is often diagnosed belatedly, at 11years of age on average and even in adulthood in some cases. This late diagnosis has a significant impact on the risks of depression and a poor quality of life. However, in adulthood or in adolescence, certain situations, personality traits and cognitive profiles or certain comorbidities should suggest the hypothesis of an Asperger-type autism spectrum disorder. We propose here a review of the clinical situations at different ages of life that could help with the screening and the referral of patients to specialized clinicians for diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

Journal of health and social behavior	2019	Jane D McLeod, Lydia DiSabatino	2 Chicago Public Schools, Chicago, IL, USA. 1 Indiana University, Bloomington, IN, USA.	We used data from the 2011 Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Services (N = 1,420) to evaluate a conceptual model linking social background (race-ethnicity, socioeconomic status [SES]) to parental distress through children's clinical profiles and parental beliefs about the nature and causes of their child's autism. Children's clinical profiles varied by social background; white children and children of more highly educated and affluent parents were less likely to experience comorbid conditions and were more likely to be diagnosed with Asperger's. Parental beliefs also varied such that parents of racial-ethnic minority children and parents of lower SES perceived their child's condition as more uncertain and were less likely to attribute it to genetic causes. Parents of Hispanic children and with lower incomes were more likely to be upset by the child's condition. Although parental beliefs had independent associations with distress, children's clinical profiles contributed more to explaining variation in distress.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2019	Sheena K Au-Yeung, Louise Bradley, Ashley E Robertson, Rebecca Shaw, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sarah Cassidy	3 University of Cambridge, UK. 1 Coventry University, UK.	Previous research shows that autistic people have high levels of co-occurring mental health conditions. Yet, a number of case reports have revealed that mental health conditions are often misdiagnosed in autistic individuals. A total of 420 adults who identified as autistic, possibly autistic or non-autistic completed an online survey consisting of questions regarding mental health diagnoses they received, whether they agreed with those diagnoses and if not why. Autistic and possibly autistic participants were more likely to report receiving mental health diagnoses compared to non-autistic participants, but were less likely to agree with those diagnoses. Thematic analysis revealed the participants' main reasons for disagreement were that (1) they felt their autism characteristics were being confused with mental health conditions by healthcare professionals and (2) they perceived their own mental health difficulties to be resultant of ASC. Participants attributed these to the clinical barriers they experienced, including healthcare professionals' lack of autism awareness and lack of communication, which in turn prevented them from receiving appropriate support. This study highlights the need for autism awareness training for healthcare professionals and the need to develop tools and interventions to accurately diagnose and effectively treat mental health conditions in autistic individuals.

Frontiers in physiology	2018	Xia-An Bi, Jie Chen, Qi Sun, Yingchao Liu, Yang Wang, Xianhao Luo	College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China.	Asperger syndrome (AS) is subtype of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Diagnosis and pathological analysis of AS through resting-state fMRI data is one of the hot topics in brain science. We employed a new model called the genetic-evolutionary random Support Vector Machine cluster (GE-RSVMC) to classify AS and normal people, and search for lesions. The model innovatively integrates the methods of the cluster and genetic evolution to improve the performance of the model. We randomly selected samples and sample features to construct GE-RSVMC, and then used the cluster to classify and extract lesions according to classification results. The model was validated by data of 157 participants (86 AS and 71 health controls) in ABIDE database. The classification accuracy of the model reached to 97.5% and we discovered the brain regions with significant differences, such as the Angular gyrus (ANG.R), Precuneus (PCUN.R), Caudate nucleus (CAU.R), Cuneus (CUN.R) and so on. Our method provides a new perspective for the diagnosis and treatment of AS, and a universal framework for other brain science research as the model has excellent generalization performance.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2019	Jerry Stuger	Independent Researcher, Overvoorde 19, 1082GA, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. jerrystuger@yahoo.com.	Religious beliefs and faith in high-functioning autistic persons are analyzed by discussing the work and biography of Franz Kafka. It enables researchers to differentiate between how autistic and non-autistic persons experience and express religious beliefs and spiritual issues because Kafka as an autistic person also wrote about these topics in his philosophical-religious writings. This Franz Kafka case study provides additional inner (cognitive) state input to better understand high-functioning autism. This contribution with new and different perspectives to the field of autism and religious beliefs could help to explore the varieties of religious experience and cognition, and to improve our insights in high-functioning autism.

Our search retrieved 811 articles, of which 34 met the inclusion criteria. Data on 26 instruments were extracted, and the measurement properties of the instruments were combined with information about their outcomes and presentation. The most commonly used interventions were the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children program and the Picture Exchange Communication System. The Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children program was shown to produce improvements in the communication skills, socialization and self-care skills of children with autism spectrum disorder. The Picture Exchange Communication System produced inconsistent results. The results of the identified studies confirm the significant importance of these instruments in improving the communicative process of autistic children."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder underdiagnosed in adults. To date, no consistent evidence of alterations in brain structure has been reported in adults with ASD and few studies were conducted at that age. We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 167 high functioning adults with ASD and 195 controls. We ran our analyses on a discovery (n = 301) and a replication sample (n = 61). The right caudal anterior cingulate cortical thickness was significantly thinner in adults with ASD compared to controls in both the discovery and the replication sample. Our work underlines the relevance of studying the brain anatomy of an adult ASD population.

Many adults with autism spectrum condition (ASC) desire outpatient psychotherapy (PT). This study compared reasons for seeking PT, experiences with PT, and modifications preferred with respect to PT of individuals with ASC to non-autistic individuals with depression (MDD). Furthermore, factors predictive for treatment satisfaction were identified in individuals with ASC. A total of 262 adults with ASC without intellectual impairment and 304 non-autistic controls with MDD were surveyed. In this pilot study both groups predominantly sought treatment for depressiveness. A low level of expertise with autism was the main reason for being declined by therapists and a contributing factor to the overall treatment dissatisfaction of patients with ASC. ASC patients desire adjustments such as written communication, and clearly structured sessions.

Frontiers in neuroinformatics	2018	Grzegorz M Wojcik, Jolanta Masiak, Andrzej Kawiak, Lukasz Kwasniewicz, Piotr Schneider, Nikodem Polak, Anna Gajos-Balinska	Neurophysiological Independent Unit of the Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland. Department of Neuroinformatics, Faculty of Mathematics, Physics and Computer Science, Institute of Computer Science, Maria Curie-Sklodowska University in Lublin, Lublin, Poland.	There are still no good quantitative methods to be applied in psychiatric diagnosis. The interview is still the main and most important tool in the psychiatrist work. This paper presents the results of electroencephalographic research with the subjects of a group of 30 patients with psychiatric disorders compared to the control group of healthy volunteers. All subjects were solving working memory task. The digit-span working memory task test was chosen as one of the most popular tasks given to subjects with cognitive dysfunctions, especially for the patients with panic disorders, depression (including the depressive phase of bipolar disorder), phobias, and schizophrenia. Having such cohort of patients some results for the subjects with insomnia and Asperger syndrome are also presented. The cortical activity of their brains was registered by the dense array EEG amplifier. Source localization using the photogrammetry station and the sLORETA algorithm was then performed in five EEG frequency bands. The most active Brodmann Areas are indicated. Methodology for mapping the brain and research protocol are presented. The first results indicate that the presented technique can be useful in finding psychiatric disorder neurophysiological biomarkers. The first attempts were made to associate hyperactivity of selected Brodmann Areas with particular disorders.

Electronic address: roberto.herai@pucpr.br.	Mitochondria are small cytosolic organelles and the main source of energy production for the cells, especially in the brain. This organelle has its own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and genetic variants in this molecule can alter the normal energy metabolism in the brain, contributing to the development of a wide assortment of Neurological Disorders (ND), including neurodevelopmental syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. These ND are comprised by a heterogeneous group of syndromes and diseases that encompass different cognitive phenotypes and behavioral disorders, such as autism, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Huntington disease, Leigh Syndrome and bipolar disorder. In this work we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and describe the mitochondrial genetic variants associated with the occurrence of ND. Most of genetic variants found in mtDNA were associated with Single Nucleotide Polimorphisms (SNPs), ~79%, with ~15% corresponding to deletions, ~3% to Copy Number Variations (CNVs), ~2% to insertions and another 1% included mtDNA replication problems and genetic rearrangements. We also found that most of the variants were associated with coding regions of mitochondrial proteins but were also found in regulatory transcripts (tRNA and rRNA) and in the D-Loop replication region of the mtDNA. After analysis of mtDNA deletions and CNV, none of them occur in the D-Loop region. This SLR shows that all transcribed mtDNA molecules have mutations correlated with ND. Finally, we describe that all mtDNA variants found were associated with deterioration of cognitive (dementia) and intellectual functions, learning disabilities, developmental delays, and personality and behavior problems.

Head banging is a commonly observed movement disorder which is typically self-limited. Complications secondary to this behavior are rare. In this report, the authors present the case of a 15-year-old patient who was treated for a forehead mass which developed secondary to chronic head banging. Surgical excision was performed for treatment of the lesion. Results from surgical pathology were notable for fibrosis consistent with history of chronic head banging. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and physical examination were also consistent with this diagnosis. This is a rare clinical entity that should be considered in patients presenting with a forehead mass and a history of head banging.

"Pathological (""extreme"") demand avoidance (PDA) involves obsessively avoiding routine demands and extreme emotional variability. It is clinically linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The observer-rated EDA Questionnaire (EDA-Q) for children was adapted as an adult self-report (EDA-QA), and tested in relation to personality and the short-form Autism Screening Questionnaire (ASQ). Study 1 (n = 347) found the EDA-QA reliable, univariate, and correlated with negative affect, antagonism, disinhibition, psychoticism, and ASQ scores. Study 2 (n = 191) found low agreeableness, greater Emotional Instability, and higher scores on the full ASQ predicted EDA-QA. PDA can screened for using this tool, occurs in the general population, and is associated with extremes of personality. Future studies will examine if PDA occurs in other clinical populations."

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2019	Taylor-Leigh Stacey, Elspeth H Froude, Julian Trollor, Kitty-Rose Foley	2 UNSW, Australia. 1 Australian Catholic University, Australia.	Leisure participation is important for well-being and has been attributed to improved quality of life for autistic individuals. Rigorous studies exploring the leisure participation of autistic adults are sparse. This study aimed to compare the type of leisure activity and frequency of participation between autistic adults and neurotypical adults as well as compare and identify factors associated with their leisure satisfaction. Data for 145 autistic and 104 neurotypical adults were obtained from time point one of the Australian Longitudinal Study of Adults with Autism. The primary outcome measure used was the Leisure Satisfaction Scale. Autistic adults were less satisfied with their leisure overall (mean = 3.29, standard deviation = 0.75) compared with neurotypical adults (mean = 3.69, standard deviation = 0.55). Multiple linear regression revealed being younger and reporting less depressive symptoms were significantly associated with higher leisure satisfaction in autistic but not neurotypical adults. Engagement in solitary leisure activities was comparable across participants, but socialising in person was predominated by neurotypical adults. Leisure activity preferences of autistic adults' and the frequency of their leisure participation are important factors for clinicians to understand when working with this population and tailoring well-being interventions.

Schizophrenia and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) are two neurodevelopmental disorders that have different symptom presentations, ages of onset and developmental courses. Both schizophrenia and ASD are characterized by marked deficit in communication, social interactions, affects and emotions. Social cognitive impairments in ASD and schizophrenia were demonstrated separately in both disorders. It was reported that these impairments have direct relation with social deficits of both disorders. The apparent similarity between social cognition impairments in ASD and schizophrenia highlights questions about the existence of common or different neurocognitive mechanisms related to social dysfunctions. In order to examine these questions, the present article provides a comprehensive review of all published studies which directly compare individuals with ASD and schizophrenia on the same cognitive tasks of social cognition.

Febantel is widely used anthelmintic drug active against a range of gastrointestinal parasites in animals. Despite the fact that it has been detected in the aquatic environment, there is no information on its environmental fate. Therefore, abiotic elimination processes of febantel in the aquatic environment have been studied. The results of direct and indirect photodegradation experiments showed that febantel was persistent against solar radiation. Kinetics of hydrolytic elimination was pH and temperature dependent with half-lives in the range from 210 min to 99 days. Febantel metabolites, fenbendazole and fenbendazole sulfone, were found as major degradation products using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The proposed hydrolytic degradation pathway consisted of the base catalyzed hydrolysis followed by consecutive oxidative cyclization to the five-membered ring of the benzo-imidazole derivative. Aquatic toxicity of febantel and its hydrolytic mixture were evaluated toward the luminescence bacteria Vibrio fischeri. Investigation of febantel sorption onto river sediments showed that the best agreement was obtained with the linear model (R

It is defined by impairments in social communication or the presence of restricted or repetitive behaviours, or both. Diagnosis is made according to existing classification systems. In recent years, especially following publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fifth Edition (DSM-5; APA 2013), children are given the diagnosis of ASD, rather than subclassifications of the spectrum such as autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified. Tests to diagnose ASD have been developed using parent or carer interview, child observation, or a combination of both.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease that is specially characterized by impairments in social communication and social skills. ASD has a high prevalence in children, affecting 1 in 160 subjects. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective tool for intervention in the health field. Different recent papers have reviewed the VR-based treatments in ASD, but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical databases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal &amp; Country Rank. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including both clinical and technical databases about the effectiveness of VR-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 450 records. After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies, duplicated articles, and the screening of the abstract and full text, 31 articles met the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) criteria and were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the effectiveness of VR-based treatments in ASD. VR can add many advantages to the treatment of ASD symptomatology, but it is necessary to develop consistent validations in future studies to state that VR can effectively complement the traditional treatments.

Since Hans Asperger's first description (Arch Psych Nervenkrankh 117:76-136, 1944), through Lorna Wing's translation and definition (Psychol Med 11:115-129, 1981), to its introduction in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM, 1994), Asperger Syndrome has always aroused huge interest and debate, until vanishing in the DSM fifth edition (2013). The debate regarded its diagnostic validity and its differentiation from high functioning autism (HFA). The present study aimed to examine whether AS differed from HFA in clinical profiles and to analyze the impact of DSM-5's innovation. Differences in cognitive, language, school functioning and comorbidities, were revealed when 80 AS and 70 HFA patients (3-18 years) were compared. Results suggested that an AS empirical distinction within autism spectrum disorder should be clinically useful.

Paraphilic disorder in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can be extremely disturbing to both the patient and caretakers. It can interfere with these patient's ability to develop social skills, which are essential for adaptation, and function within society. This case report details the history of an 18-year-old male patient previously diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, who also exhibited symptoms consistent with paraphilic disorder. A review of the literature was then conducted to determine if there is any documented association of paraphilic disorder, or abnormal sexual behavior in patients with ASD. Several case reports involving patients with ASD, and co-morbid paraphilic disorder have been described in the literature. ASD appears to be associated with paraphilic disorder.

29978627		Jurors' and Judges' Evaluation of Defendants with Autism and the Impact on Sentencing: A Systematic Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) Review of Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Courtroom.	Journal of law and medicine	2017	Clare S Allely, Penny Cooper	Barrister (39 Essex Chambers, London). Lecturer in Psychology, Centre for Health Sciences Research, University of Salford, Salford, England; affiliate member of the Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.	Concern has been highlighted in the literature regarding how juries and judges handle cases which involve a defendant with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The relatively little research on judicial perceptions or decision-making regarding individuals with ASD indicates that judges have limited understanding and familiarity with high-functioning ASD (hfASD) and ASD. The present systematic review will identify studies which investigate jurors' (eg using mock jurors) and/or judges' evaluations of defendants with ASD and studies which investigate whether the defendant diagnosis of ASD impacts on sentencing. Only four studies were identified which investigated jurors' and/or judges' evaluations of a defendant with an ASD or investigated whether the defendant diagnosis of ASD impacts on sentencing. Further research is recommended which should include an evaluation of cases involving a defendant with an hfASD or ASD diagnosis comparing charges, pleas entered, procedural adjustments at court, evidence adduced about the defendant's condition, directions to juries, judicial remarks on the evidence (eg summing-up for the jury), verdicts and sentencing. This would enable the assessment of the specific offending behaviour and disorder of the defendant, and how these may be relevant to their mental capacity and culpability.

Following our previous cross-sectional analysis, indicating age-related improvements of response inhibition in a random-motor-generation task (MPT) in adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS), the present study reports data from a 2.5-year follow-up examination in the original sample. We found more marked improvements within the follow-up interval in younger AS children, while older AS boys as well as typically developing (TD) boys remained at a relatively constant level throughout. The current longitudinal study further substantiates the notion that AS children (on average) catch up with TD children when they grow older as regards the basic inhibition of developing routine response patterns.

Many young adults, specifically those with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), do not meet the national physical activity (PA) guidelines. One way to address this problem may be to examine the factors that motivate individuals to engage in PA. However, the majority of current literature does not consider the unique characteristics of individuals with ASD, which may influence their motivation.

Neurophysiological Independent Unit of the Department of Psychiatry, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.	The interview is still the main and most important tool in psychiatrist's work. The neuroimaging methods such as CT or MRI are widely used in other fields of medicine, for instance neurology. However, psychiatry lacks effective quantitative methods to support of diagnosis. A novel neuroinformatic approach to help clinical patients by means of electroencephalographic technology in order to build foundations for finding neurophysiological biomarkers of psychiatric disorders is proposed. A cohort of 30 right-handed patients (21 males, 9 females) with psychiatric disorders (mainly with panic and anxiety disorder, Asperger syndrome as well as with phobic anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, nonorganic hypersomnia, and moderate depressive episode) were examined using the dense array EEG amplifier in the P300 experiment. The results were compared with the control group of 30 healthy, right-handed male volunteers. The quantitative analysis of cortical activity was conducted using the sLORETA source localization algorithm. The most active Brodmann Areas were pointed out and a new quantitative observable of electrical charge flowing through the selected Brodmann Area is proposed. The precise methodology and research protocol for collecting EEG data as well as the roadmap of future investigations in this area are presented. The essential result of this study is the idea proven by the initial results of our experiments that it is possible to determine quantitatively biomarkers of particular psychiatric disorders in order to support the process of diagnosis and hopefully choose most appropriate medical treatment later.

Institute of Genomic Medicine, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.	The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) controversially combined previously distinct subcategories of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) into a single diagnostic category. However, genetic convergences and divergences between different ASD subcategories are unclear. By retrieving 1725 exonic de novo mutations (DNMs) from 1628 subjects with autistic disorder (AD), 1873 from 1564 subjects with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), 276 from 247 subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS), and 2077 from 2299 controls, we found that rates of putative functional DNMs (loss-of-function, predicted deleterious missense, and frameshift) in all three subcategories were significantly higher than those in control. We then investigated the convergences and divergences of the three ASD subcategories based on four genetic aspects: whether any two ASD subcategories (1) shared significantly more genes with functional DNMs, (2) exhibited similar spatio-temporal expression patterns, (3) shared significantly more candidate genes, and (4) shared some ASD-associated functional pathways. It is revealed that AD and PDD-NOS were broadly convergent in terms of all four genetic aspects, suggesting these two ASD subcategories may be genetically combined. AS was divergent to AD and PDD-NOS for aspects of functional DNMs and expression patterns, whereas AS and AD/PDD-NOS were convergent for aspects of candidate genes and functional pathways. Our results indicated that the three ASD subcategories present more genetic convergences than divergences, favouring DSM-5's new classification. This study suggests that specifically defined genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes should be integrated analyzed for precise diagnosis of complex disorders, such as ASD.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism, Asperger's syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The new diagnostic criteria of ASD focuses on two core domains: social communication impairment and restricted interests/repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of ASD has been steadily increasing over the past two decades, with current estimates reaching up to 1 in 36 children. Hereditary factors, parental history of psychiatric disorders, pre-term births, and fetal exposure to psychotropic drugs or insecticides have all been linked to higher risk of ASD. Several scales such as the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), The Autism Spectrum Disorder-Observation for Children (ASD-OC), The Developmental, Dimensional, and Diagnostic Interview (3di), are available to aid in better assessing the behaviors and symptoms associated with ASD. Nearly 75% of ASD patients suffer from comorbid psychiatric illnesses or conditions, which may include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, Tourette syndrome, and others. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are available for ASD. Pharmacological treatments include psychostimulants, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists. These medications provide partial symptomatic relief of core symptoms of ASD or manage the symptoms of comorbid conditions. Non-pharmacological interventions, which show promising evidence in improving social interaction and verbal communication of ASD patients, include music therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy and social behavioral therapy. Hormonal therapies with oxytocyin or vasopressin receptor antagonists have also shown some promise in improving core ASD symptoms. The use of vitamins, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements in conjunction with pharmacological and behavioral treatment appear to have some effect in symptomatic improvement in ASD, though additional studies are needed to confirm these benefits. Developing novel disease-modifying therapies may prove to be the ultimate intervention for sustained improvement of symptoms in ASD.

Journal of applied behavior analysis	2018	Mahshid Ghaemmaghami, Gregory P Hanley, Joshua Jessel, Robin Landa	Western New England University.	Response efficiency plays an important role in the initial success of functional communication training (FCT). Although low-effort functional communication responses (FCRs) have been shown to be most effective in replacing problem behavior; more developmentally advanced FCRs are favored later in the treatment process. Attempts to teach these more complex FCRs, however, often lead to the resurgence of problem behavior. In this study, we provide a detailed description of an effective shaping process applied within a changing criterion design to develop complex FCRs from simple FCRs without resurgence of problem behavior. Four children with various language and intellectual abilities participated in this study. A practical shaping procedure, suitable for typical teaching contexts, is described for two participants in Experiment 1. The necessity and efficacy of the shaping process are demonstrated with the participants in Experiment 2. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

School of Psychology and Counselling, University of Southern Queensland, West Street, Toowoomba, 4350, Australia.	Increasing attention is being paid to how adults on the autism spectrum perceive and interpret the interoceptive sense. This 20-item Interoception Sensory Questionnaire represents a single factor scale that can be interpreted as representing confusion about interoceptive bodily states unless these states are extreme (Alexisomia), and has been designed to discriminate across populations (total sample 511 participants). Findings showed that 74% of adults with autism reported interoceptive confusion. Another finding of the study was that as autistic traits increased, interoceptive confusion increased, with adults with diagnosed autism scoring highest on the construct. Implications for physiological self-regulation as well as physical health outcomes are discussed, as well as recommendations for future research.

Molecular autism	2018	Herwig Czech	Ethics, Collections, and History of Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Straße 25, 1090 Vienna, Austria.	Hans Asperger (1906-1980) first designated a group of children with distinct psychological characteristics as 'autistic psychopaths' in 1938, several years before Leo Kanner's famous 1943 paper on autism. In 1944, Asperger published a comprehensive study on the topic (submitted to Vienna University in 1942 as his postdoctoral thesis), which would only find international acknowledgement in the 1980s. From then on, the eponym 'Asperger's syndrome' increasingly gained currency in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the conceptualization of the condition. At the time, the fact that Asperger had spent pivotal years of his career in Nazi Vienna caused some controversy regarding his potential ties to National Socialism and its race hygiene policies. Documentary evidence was scarce, however, and over time a narrative of Asperger as an active opponent of National Socialism took hold. The main goal of this paper is to re-evaluate this narrative, which is based to a large extent on statements made by Asperger himself and on a small segment of his published work.

There is increasing evidence that altered immune responses play a role in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), together with dysfunction of the serotonergic and glutamatergic systems. Since the kynurenine (KYN) pathway that degrades tryptophan (TRP) is activated in various neuroinflammatory states, we aimed to determine whether this pathway is activated in ASD.

The present study aimed to compare prevalence of autistic traits measured by the self-reported autism spectrum quotient-short (AQ-short) in a transgender clinical population (n = 656) matched by age and sex assigned at birth to a cisgender community sample. Results showed that transgender and cisgender people reported similar levels of possible autistic caseness. Transgender people assigned female were more likely to have clinically significant autistic traits compared to any other group. No difference was found between those assigned male. High AQ scores may not be indicative of the presence of an autism spectrum condition as the difference between groups mainly related to social behaviours; such scores may be a reflection of transgender people's high social anxiety levels due to negative past experiences.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the severity of symptoms varies over subjects. The iCAPs model (innovation-driven co-activation patterns) is a recently developed spatio-temporal model to describe fMRI data. In this study, the iCAPs model was employed to find functional imaging biomarkers for ASD in resting-state fMRI data. MRI data from 125 ASD patients and 243 healthy controls was selected from the online ABIDE data repository. Following standard fMRI preprocessing steps, the iCAP patterns were fitted to the data to obtain network time series. Furthermore, specific combinations of iCAPs were mapped to behavioral domain time series. To quantify to which extent the time series contribute to the fMRI dynamics, their (temporal) standard deviation was calculated and compared between patients and controls. Abnormalities were found in networks involving subcortical and limbic areas and default mode network regions. When mapping the network dynamics to behavioral domain time series, abnormalities were found in emotional and visual behavioral subdomains, and within the ASD spectrum were more pronounced in subjects with autism compared to Asperger's syndrome. Also a trend towards impairment in networks facilitating social cognition was found. The functional imaging abnormalities are consistent with the behavioral impairments typical for ASD.

People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly experience symptoms related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. One-third of ASD cases may be complicated by the presence of ADHD. Individuals with dual diagnoses face greater barriers to accessing treatment for ADHD and respond less positively to primary pharmacologic interventions. Nonpharmacologic technology-aided tools for hyperactivity and inattention in people with ASD are being developed, although research into their efficacy and safety remains limited.

This study tests if the drives to empathize (E) and systemize (S), measured by the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R) and Empathy Quotient (EQ), show effects of sex and academic degree. The responses of 419 students from the Humanities and the Physical Sciences were analyzed in terms of the E-S theory predictions. Results confirm that there is an interaction between sex, degree and the drive to empathize relative to systemize. Female students in the Humanities on average had a stronger drive to empathize than to systemize in comparison to males in the Humanities. Male students in the Sciences on average had a stronger drive to systemize than to empathize in comparison to females in the Sciences. Finally, students in the sciences on average had a stronger drive to systemize more than to empathize, irrespective of their sex. The reverse is true for students in the Humanities. These results strongly replicate earlier findings.

Frontiers in integrative neuroscience	2018	Carla Caballero, Sejal Mistry, Joe Vero, Elizabeth B Torres	Department of Mathematics, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, United States. Department of Biomedical Engineering, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States. Department of Psychology, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United States.	The variability inherently present in biophysical data is partly contributed by disparate sampling resolutions across instrumentations. This poses a potential problem for statistical inference using pooled data in open access repositories. Such repositories combine data collected from multiple research sites using variable sampling resolutions. One example is the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange repository containing thousands of imaging and demographic records from participants in the spectrum of autism and age-matched neurotypical controls. Further, statistical analyses of groups from different diagnoses and demographics may be challenging, owing to the disparate number of participants across different clinical subgroups. In this paper, we examine the noise signatures of head motion data extracted from resting state fMRI data harnessed under different sampling resolutions. We characterize the quality of the noise in the variability of the raw linear and angular speeds for different clinical phenotypes in relation to age-matched controls. Further, we use bootstrapping methods to ensure compatible group sizes for statistical comparison and report the ranges of physical involuntary head excursions of these groups. We conclude that different sampling rates do affect the quality of noise in the variability of head motion data and, consequently, the type of random process appropriate to characterize the time series data. Further, given a qualitative range of noise, from pink to brown noise, it is possible to characterize different clinical subtypes and distinguish them in relation to ranges of neurotypical controls. These results may be of relevance to the pre-processing stages of the pipeline of analyses of resting state fMRI data, whereby head motion enters the criteria to clean imaging data from motion artifacts.

Asperger Syndrome and/or Clinical High Risk of Psychosis? A Differential Diagnostic Challenge This case-study deals with the often difficult differential diagnosis of Asperger syndrome and a clinical high risk state of psychosis, in particular as indicated by attenuated psychotic symptoms, as well as with its therapeutic implications. The presented case is a 10-year old girl, who has not been diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder before being referred to a specialized center for early detection of psychosis due to possible hallucinatory experiences and delusional ideas. We demonstrate how to perform a context-sensitive differential diagnosis to distinguish between specific interests as well as related behaviors and unusual thought content as well as perceptive abnormalities, between paranoid ideas and biased interpretations of the behaviors of others typical for autism, and between disorganized symptoms and autistic unusual communication and social behavior. The resulting dual diagnoses in our case-study formed the basis for a complex differential indication, which considered both the increased stress vulnerability associated with an increased risk for the development of psychosis as well as the rigid thinking style associated with autism. Our case-report shows that such a precise differential indication can lead to stabilization over the long-term, even in patients with dual diagnoses.

The perisylvian areas, located around the Sylvian fissure, are constituted by frontal, temporal and parietal brain regions. These are connected forming specialized neural networks and play a primary role in the development of linguistic skills and social cognition. These areas are a possible neuronal substrate of cognitive and behavioral impairments in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).

Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) previously hypothesized that pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) was not associated with mercury (Hg) exposure because the medical conditions associated with Hg exposure were not associated with PDD. A hypothesis-testing longitudinal case-control study evaluated the frequency of medically diagnosed conditions previously associated with Hg poisoning, including: epilepsy, dysarthria, failure to thrive, cerebral palsy, or contact dermatitis and other eczema among children preceding their eventual PDD diagnosis (cases) compared to controls. A retrospective examination of medical records within the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) was undertaken. Cases diagnosed with PDD (n = 534) were born from 1991 to 2000 and continuously enrolled until their PDD diagnosis. Controls (n = 26,367) were born from 1991 to 1993 and continuously enrolled from birth for 7.22 years. Within the first 5 years of life, cases compared to controls were significantly (p < 0.0001) more likely to be assigned a diagnosis of contact dermatitis and other eczema (odds ratio (OR) = 2.033), dysarthria (OR = 23.992), epilepsy (OR = 5.351), failure to thrive (OR = 25.3), and cerebral palsy (OR = 4.464). Similar results were observed when the data were separated by gender. Overall, the results of the present study and recently published studies provide direct evidence supporting a link in twelve of twelve categories (100%) of Hg poisoning associated symptoms as defined by Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) and symptoms observed in those with a PDD diagnosis. The results of this study support the biological plausibility of Hg poisoning to induce PDD diagnoses and rejection of the Nelson and Bauman (Pediatrics 111:674-679, 2003) hypothesis because those with a PDD diagnosis have an increased frequency of conditions previously associated with Hg poisoning.

Neurodevelopmental disorders disproportionately affect males. The mechanisms underlying male vulnerability or female protection are not known and remain understudied. Determining the processes involved is crucial to understanding the etiology and advancing treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders. Here, we review current findings and theories that contribute to male preponderance of neurodevelopmental disorders, with a focus on autism.

Department of Psychiatry, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany. Electronic address: stefan.roepke@charite.de.	Although deficits in the recognition of emotional facial expressions are considered a hallmark of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), characterization of abnormalities in the differentiation of emotional expressions (e.g., sad vs. angry) has been rather inconsistent, especially in adults without intellectual impairments who may compensate for their deficits. In addition, previous research neglected the ability to detect emotional expressions (e.g., angry vs. neutral). The present study used a backward masking paradigm to investigate, a) the detection of emotional expressions, and b) the differentiation of emotional expressions in adults diagnosed with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (n = 23) compared to neurotypical controls (n = 25). Compensatory strategies were prevented by shortening the stimulus presentation time (33, 67, and 100 ms). In general, participants with ASD were significantly less accurate in detecting and differentiating emotional expressions compared to the control group. In the emotion differentiation task, individuals with ASD profited significantly less from an increase in presentation time. These results reinforce theoretical models that individuals with ASD have deficits in emotion recognition under time constraints. Furthermore, first evidence was provided that emotion detection and emotion differentiation are impaired in ASD.

Individuals with ASD have abnormal motor and perceptual functions that do not currently form diagnostic criteria of ASD, but nevertheless may affect everyday behaviour. Temporal processing seems to be one of such non-diagnostic yet impaired domains, although the lack of systematic studies testing different aspects of timing in the same sample of participants prevents a conclusive assessment of whether there is a generalized temporal deficit in ASD associated with diagnostic symptoms. 17 children diagnosed with ASD and 18 typically developing age- and IQ-matched controls carried out a set of motor and perceptual timing tasks: free tapping, simultaneity judgment, auditory duration discrimination, and verbal duration estimation. Parents of participants filled in a questionnaire assessing the sense and management of time. Children with ASD showed faster and more variable free tapping than controls. Auditory duration discrimination thresholds were higher in the ASD group than controls in a sub-second version of the task, while there were no group differences in a supra-second discrimination of intervals. Children with ASD showed more variable thresholds of simultaneity judgment, and they received lower parental scores for their sense and management of time. No group differences were observed in the verbal duration estimation task in the minute-range. Different timing functions were correlated in the ASD group but not among controls, whilst several timing measures correlated with ASD symptoms. We conclude that children with ASD show a broad range of abnormalities in temporal processing tasks including motor timing, perceptual timing, and temporal perspective.

Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital-Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan. Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan.	School dysfunction is observed in youths with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the factors moderating their school dysfunction have not been well explored. This study investigated school functions in youths with ASD in Taiwan, stratified by personal characteristics including demographics, ASD subtypes, intelligence profiles, and the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). We recruited 160 youths (aged 6-18 years, 87.5% boys) with a clinical diagnosis of ASD and 160 age and gender-matched typically developing (TD) youths. Their parents received a semi-structured psychiatric interview for their ASD and ADHD diagnoses and reported their school functions. Youths with ASD were further grouped into low-functioning autism (LFA, ASD with intellectual disability and developmental language delay, n = 44), high-functioning autism (HFA, ASD with no intellectual disability, n = 55) and Asperger's syndrome (AS, ASD with neither language delay nor intellectual disability, n = 61). Compared to TD, ASD had worse school functions in the domains of academic performance, attitude toward schoolwork, social interaction, and behavioral problems except for no academic differences from TD in HFA and ASD without ADHD. Subgroup analysis revealed that HFA and AS had better academic performance but showed worse attitude toward school than LFA. Comorbidity of ADHD negatively impacted all domains of school functions. Besides autistic and ADHD symptoms, oppositional symptoms, lower intelligence, older age, and female gender in youths also predicted school dysfunction. Although youths with ASD have school dysfunction in several domains, this study specifically addresses the role of intelligence and comorbid ADHD on their school dysfunction.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2018	Isaac R Melamed, Melinda Heffron, Alessandro Testori, Kellie Lipe	IMMUNOe Research Centers, Centennial, Colorado.	Research has shown that a subset of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population presents with immune dysregulation. To explore this topic further, we investigated the efficacy and tolerability of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion in children with ASD. In this study, participants were recruited based on a diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Participants also showed evidence of immune dysfunction based on abnormal levels of specific biomarkers, including CD40 ligand (CD154), lymphocyte stimulation, and T or B cell dysfunction. Of 17 screened patients, 14 completed the trial and received IVIG treatment (1 g/kg dose) for ten 21-day treatment cycles. The primary endpoint was disease improvement assessed using standardized cognitive and behavioral tests (Children's Communication Checklist [CCC-2], Social Responsiveness Scale [SRS], Aberrant Behavior Checklist [ABC], Clinical Global Impressions-Severity [CGI-S] and -Improvement [CGI-I], Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [ADOS], and Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [PPVT]). Secondary endpoints included experimental biomarkers such as CD154, toll-like receptor-4, memory B cells, FOXP3, and lymphocyte stimulation. Significant improvements from baseline to study endpoint were observed in several subscales of the CCC-2, SRS, CGI-I, CGI-S, and ADOS, including Associated Maladaptive Behaviors (P ≤ .043), Reciprocal Social Interaction (P = .015), Communication (P < .001), and Stereotyped Behaviors and Repetitive Interests (P ≤ .013). Statistically significant reductions were also seen in numerous secondary outcomes of immunological biomarkers indicative of neuroinflammation. IVIG was well tolerated; no subjects withdrew due to an adverse event, and clinical data showed no evidence of thromboembolic events.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2018	N Shea, E Payne, N Russo	Department of Psychology, Syracuse University, 430 University Ave, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA. nrusso@syr.edu. Department of Psychology, Syracuse University, 430 University Ave, Syracuse, NY, 13244, USA.	Individuals with ASD often display externalizing behaviors, which have been associated with lower quality of life in adulthood. Social difficulties have been hypothesized to underlie externalizing problems among individuals with ASD (Klin and Volkmar in Asperger Syndrome, 340-366, 2000), but this has never been tested empirically. We examined whether socialization abilities predicted externalizing problems assessed by parent report in a group of 29 individuals with ASD (age range 7-16 years) and 29 TD individuals matched for IQ, age, and gender. Socialization scores accounted for 50% of the variance in externalizing behaviors among individuals with ASD, but not in TD children. These findings have implications for intervention, and suggest that targeting social difficulties might provide a better means to addressing externalizing problems.

We compared the maternal reports on mothering and family processes between 160 youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 160 age and gender-matched typically developing (TD) youth stratified by personal characteristics from Taiwan. The ASD groups consisted of 51 'typical autism' (TA), 52 'high-functioning autism' (HFA), and 57 'Asperger syndrome (AS).' Maternal reports showed that youth with ASD obtained less affection and more protection from the mother, and had less active mother-child interactions and more behavioral problems at home. Their mothers perceived less family support when compared to mothers of TD youth. Moreover, both TA and AS groups had more maternal protection and less maternal perceived family support, whereas HFA and co-occurring ADHD were only associated with more behavioral problems at home. The maternal and family process may vary across different ASD subgroups.

Emotion goals lie at the heart of emotion regulation, as people have to first decide what emotions they want to feel before engaging in emotion regulation. Given that children with Asperger's syndrome (AS) are characterized by exhibiting difficulties in emotion regulation, studying whether they display similar or different emotion goals compared to typically developing (TD) children may provide insightful information.
29398933		Sexuality in autism: hypersexual and paraphilic behavior in women and men with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.	Dialogues in clinical neuroscience	2017	Daniel Schöttle, Peer Briken, Oliver Tüscher, Daniel Turner	Institute for Sex Research and Forensic Psychiatry, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.

Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany. Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Mainz, Mainz, Germany.	Like nonaffected adults, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) show the entire range of sexual behaviors. However, due to the core symptoms of the disorder spectrum, including deficits in social skills, sensory hypo- and hypersensitivities, and repetitive behaviors, some ASD individuals might develop quantitatively above-average or nonnormative sexual behaviors and interests. After reviewing the relevant literature on sexuality in high-functioning ASD individuals, we present novel findings on the frequency of normal sexual behaviors and those about the assessment of hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors in ASD individuals from our own study. Individuals with ASD seem to have more hypersexual and paraphilic fantasies and behaviors than general-population studies suggest. However, this inconsistency is mainly driven by the observations for male participants with ASD. This could be due to the fact that women with ASD are usually more socially adapted and show less ASD symptomatology. The peculiarities in sexual behaviors in ASD patients should be considered both for sexual education and in therapeutic approaches.

The International journal of psycho-analysis	2018	Mauro Manica	Via Porta 3, 28100 Novara, Italy.	This paper presents the case of a patient on the autistic spectrum (ASD) and proposes a theoretical and technical model which seeks to illustrate the characteristics of the relational and intersubjective perspective in psychoanalysis. Along a complementary axis this perspective combines the knowledge which psychoanalytic research, starting from Kanner and Asperger, has developed through the studies by among others Tustin and Meltzer. The model is conceived from the vertex of a psychoanalysis which seeks to deal with disorganized and unrepresentable states of mind. Important is the personality of the analyst, who must be prepared to experience nothingness, meaninglessness and the chaos of a contiguous-autistic (CA) position. We can then consider a wider oscillation in the field in addition to PS↔D, namely CA↔PS↔D. Disorganized states of mind exist that result from a cumulative trauma which occured very early on, during the pre-natal or at least pre-verbal and pre-representational stages of psychic development.Such states then become the effect of a basic deficit that the analytic field can oneirically transform into trauma which, through reciprocity, micro-attunements, the encounter with the analyst's negative capability and rêverie, can then evolve into a traumatic experience which can finally be subjected to symbolic alphabetization.

Centre for Innovative Research Across the Life Course, Coventry University, UK. School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, UK. Centre for Violence Prevention, University of Worcester, UK.	Depression is the most commonly experienced mental health condition in adults with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, it is unclear what tools are currently being used to assess depression in ASC, or whether tools need to be adapted for this group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess depression in adults with and without ASC, and then evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties. Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched for studies of depression in: (a) adults with ASC, without co-morbid intellectual disability; and (b) adults from the general population without co-morbid conditions. Articles examining the measurement properties of these tools were then searched for using a methodological filter in PubMed, and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist. Twelve articles were identified which utilized three tools to assess depression in adults with ASC, but only one article which assessed the measurement properties of one of these tools was identified and thus evaluated. Sixty-four articles were identified which utilized five tools to assess depression in general population adults, and fourteen articles had assessed the measurement properties of these tools. Overall, two tools were found to be robust in their measurement properties in the general population-the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Crucially only one study was identified from the COSMIN search, which showed weak evidence in support of the measurement properties of the BDI-II in an ASC sample. Implications for effective measurement of depression in ASC are discussed.

"During observation of the Necker cube perception becomes unstable and alternates repeatedly between a from-above-perspective (""fap"") and a from-below-perspective (""fbp"") interpretation. Both interpretations are physically equally plausible, however, observers usually show an a priori top-down bias in favor of the fap interpretation. Patients with Autism spectrum disorder are known to show an altered pattern of perception with a focus on sensory details. In the present study we tested whether this altered perceptual processing affects their reversal dynamics and reduces the perceptual bias during Necker cube observation."

Journal of the history of the behavioral sciences	2018	Annemieke Van Drenth		"Historiographies on the phenomenon of ""autism"" display Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger as the great pioneers. The recent controversy on who was first in ""discovering"" autism urges research into the question of how scientific discoveries relate to processes of academic reflection and social intervention. The Netherlands provide an interesting case in pioneering work in autism, since Dutch experts described autism in children already in the late 1930s, preceding the first publications on autism in children by Kanner and Asperger. This paper examines the Dutch origins of autism by focusing on Ida Frye's contribution to the teamwork at the Paedological Institute in Nijmegen, which resulted in descriptions of children with autism. The theoretical aim of this paper is to underline the importance of the productive interplay between social interventions and scientific efforts concerning the complex inner world of special children."

Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, No. 7, Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, 10002, Taiwan.	In a sample of 37 adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 35 typically-developing controls (TDC), we investigated sensory symptoms by clinical measures, and Mismatch Negativity and P3a component at Fz with the frequency and duration oddball paradigms of event-related potentials. Results showed that compared to TDC, ASD participants reported more sensory symptoms, and presented a shorter P3a peak latency in the duration paradigm, which was correlated with more social awareness deficits. In the frequency paradigm, P3a parameters were correlated with sensation avoiding and attention characteristics of ASD. Our findings suggest that sensory abnormality in ASD may extend into adolescence and young adulthood. P3a latency might be a potential neurophysiological marker for ASD.

Division of Habilitation and Rehabilitation, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Lillehammer, Norway. Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. Department of Education and Social Work, Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Lillehammer, Norway.	Children with autism often struggle with emotional and behavioral problems (EBP). This study investigated whether level of autism symptoms, attention problems or verbal IQ at baseline can predict EBP 2 years later in children with High-Functioning Autism (HFA). Thirty-four participants with HFA and 45 typically developing children (TD) (ages 9-16) were assessed with parent ratings of EBP, autism symptoms, attention problems, and a test of verbal IQ. The amount of autism symptoms and degree of attention problems at baseline significantly predicted EBP at follow-up, whereas verbal IQ did not. The findings from this study emphasize the importance of assessing and understanding the consequences of autism symptoms and attention problems when treating EBP in children with HFA. Furthermore, interventions aimed at improving ASD symptoms may positively affect the prevalence of EBP in children with HFA.
29172638	doi: 10.1177/1362361317742140	The Survey of Favorite Interests and Activities: Assessing and understanding restricted interests in children with autism spectrum disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2019	A Smerbeck	Rochester Institute of Technology, USA.	Restricted interests are an established diagnostic symptom of autism spectrum disorder. While there is considerable evidence that these interests have maladaptive consequences, they also provide a range of benefits. This article introduces a new instrument, the Survey of Favorite Interests and Activities, and uses it to examine the nature of restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder. Respondents report substantial benefits of restricted interests as well as areas of difficulty. The Survey of Favorite Interests and Activities assesses Social Flexibility, Perseveration, Respondent Discomfort, Adaptive Coping, and Atypicality. All scales have Cronbach's α > 0.70. Age and socioeconomic status have little effect on Survey of Favorite Interests and Activities scales; nor does gender with the exception of interest Atypicality. The expected pattern of correlations with existing scales was found. Research and clinical implications are discussed.
29167722	doi: 10.18869/nirp.bcn.8.5.349	Behavioral, Cognitive and Neural Markers of Asperger Syndrome.	Basic and clinical neuroscience	2017	Farnaz Faridi, Reza Khosrowabadi	Institute for Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.	Asperger syndrome (AS) is a subtype of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterized by major problems in social and nonverbal communication, together with limited and repetitive forms of behavior and interests. The linguistic and cognitive development in AS is preserved which help us to differentiate it from other subtypes of ASD. However, significant effects of AS on cognitive abilities and brain functions still need to be researched. Although a clear cut pathology for Asperger has not been identified yet, recent studies have largely focused on brain imaging techniques to investigate AS. In this regard, we carried out a systematic review on behavioral, cognitive, and neural markers (specifically using MRI and fMRI) studies on AS. In this paper, behavior, motor skills and language capabilities of individuals with Asperger are compared to those in healthy controls. In addition, common findings across MRI and fMRI based studies associated with behavior and cognitive disabilities are highlighted.

It is important to consider whether there are innate vulnerabilities that increase the risk of an individual with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), predominantly those defendants with a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome, being charged and convicted of a sexual offence. The significance of such can be readily seen in recent English case law, with judgments on appeal finding convictions unsafe where there have been a number of failings in the Judge's summing up. In this article, we will consider the gravity of Judges omitting to highlight a defendant's diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and the necessity of detailed explanations to jury members regarding the condition and its effect upon thoughts and behaviour. Consideration will be specifically given to the necessity to prove sexual motivation in such offences and the judicial direction required in relation to whether the appellant's actions had been sexually motivated. Recognition of the social impairments inherent in ASDs are vital to this work and we shall consider whether the difficulty with the capacity to develop appropriate, consenting sexual relationships as a result of impaired social cognition may be one of the factors which increases the risk of sexual offending in individuals with ASD (Higgs & Carter, 2015).

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has both genetic and environmental origins, including potentially maternal effects. Maternal effects describe the association of one or more maternal phenotypes with liability to ASD in progeny that are independent of maternally transmitted risk alleles. While maternal effects could play an important role, consistent with association to maternal traits such as immune status, no study has estimated maternal, additive genetic, and environmental effects in ASD.

The Questionnaire for Autism Spectrum Conditions (Q-ASC) was developed by Attwood et al. (2011) to identify gender-sensitive profiles of autism symptomatology; prioritise and adjust the direction of clinical interventions; and support positive psychosocial outcomes and prognosis into adulthood. The current research piloted the Q-ASC with parents of 238 children with a clinical diagnosis of ASD-Level 1 (without intellectual or language impairment). Data analysis revealed eight interpretable and reliable components of the Q-ASC using Principle components analysis. Comparisons across age and gender groups found statistically significant mean differences of parent-reported characteristics. The findings from this study aim to identify improvements in the Q-ASC towards the future assessment of the sensitivity and diversity of presentations of autism among female children and adolescents.

Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health	2017	Megan Hatfield, Marita Falkmer, Torbjorn Falkmer, Marina Ciccarelli	School of Occupational Therapy and Social Work, Curtin University, Perth, Australia.	The majority of existing transition planning programs are focused on people with a disability in general and may not meet the specific need of adolescents on the autism spectrum. In addition, these interventions focus on specific skills (e.g. job readiness or self-determination) rather than the overall transition planning process and there are methodological limitations to many of the studies determining their effectiveness. The Better OutcOmes & Successful Transitions for Autism (BOOST-A™) is an online program that supports adolescents on the autism spectrum to prepare for leaving school. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the BOOST-A™ in enhancing self-determination.

PloS one	2017	Ewa Pisula, Anna Porębowicz-Dörsmann	Faculty of Psychology, University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.	The aim of the study was to investigate the perception of the family functioning in parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with normal-range intelligence and the relationships between family functioning, parenting stress and quality of life. Dyads of parents of children with ASD without intellectual disability and parents of typically developing children (controls) completed a set of self-report questionnaires. Parents of children with ASD reported lower functioning of the family as a whole and their own functioning as family members; they exhibited higher levels of parenting stress and lower quality of life. Mothers of children with ASD experienced more stress in personal domain than fathers. Relationships between family functioning, parenting stress and quality of life have been established. There were also moderate to strong correlations in mother-father dyads between their assessments of family functioning, parenting stress and QoL in social relationships and environmental domains.

Increasing numbers of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are enrolling in post-secondary academic institutions. However, research indicates that post-secondary students with ASD are struggling more than their typically developing peers, with high rates of loneliness, anxiety, depression, and an increased incidence of dropping-out before completion of their degrees. The current study utilized an online survey to gain insight into the self-reported academic, social, and mental health experiences of post-secondary students with ASD. Participants reported high levels of academic comfort, but struggled with issues of isolation/loneliness and high levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Of greatest concern, were the nearly three-quarters of participants who reported lifetime suicidal behaviors. Further analysis on collected data and implications of findings are discussed.

Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Saarland University Hospital, 66421, Homburg, Germany.	"Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are defined by persistent deficits in reciprocal social interaction, communication, and language, as well as stereotyped and repetitive behavior. Functional incontinence, as well as ASD are common disorders in childhood. The aim of this systematic review was to give an overview of the co-occurrence of nocturnal enuresis (NE), daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), and fecal incontinence (FI) in ASD, and vice versa, of ASD in children with incontinence. A systematic literature search of the terms ""incontinence"", ""enuresis"", and ""encopresis"" in combination with ""autism"" or ""Asperger"" in four databases (Scopus, PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of science) was conducted. All studies that examined incontinence frequencies in samples with ASD, and studies that measured frequencies of ASD diagnoses or symptoms in samples with incontinence were included. Risk of bias and limitations of each study were described. After eligibility assessment, 33 publications were included in the review. The published literature implies a higher prevalence of incontinence in children with ASD compared to typically developing children. Limitations and biases as inappropriate diagnostic criteria for ASD and incontinence, selected samples, or lack of control groups are reported. Associations of incontinence in ASD with psychopathological symptoms were found. Vice versa, ASD symptoms are found in incontinent children, but no study included a non-ASD control sample. Incontinence symptoms are also reported as an adverse effect of medication in ASD. Due to methodological problems and definitional discrepancies in some publications, results have to be interpreted cautiously. Research in ASD and incontinence is scarce. More systematic research including state-of-the-art assessments is needed."

A process evaluation was conducted to determine the effectiveness, usability, and barriers and facilitators related to the Better OutcOmes & Successful Transitions for Autism (BOOST-A™), an online transition planning program. Adolescents on the autism spectrum (n = 33) and their parents (n = 39) provided feedback via an online questionnaire. Of these, 13 participants were interviewed to gain in-depth information about their experiences. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Four themes were identified: (i) taking action to overcome inertia, (ii) new insights that led to clear plans for the future, (iii) adolescent empowerment through strengths focus, and (iv) having a champion to guide the way. The process evaluation revealed why BOOST-A™ was beneficial to some participants more than others. Trial registration #ACTRN12615000119594.

BMJ case reports	2017	Georgina Hicks, Nigel D'Souza, Rhys Thomas, Ranjeet Brar	Department of General Surgery, Croydon University Hospital, Croydon, UK.	Acute gastric necrosis is a very rare but potentially fatal condition which has been reported in patients with abnormal eating behaviours.We describe the case of a 24-year-old female with a background of Asperger's syndrome, who presented with abdominal pain and gross distension. She underwent an emergency exploratory laparotomy and was found to have a massively distended, necrotic stomach. A total gastrectomy was performed with interval reconstruction planned. This case reports the surgical management of a rarely seen condition and highlights the importance of recognising gastric necrosis and its causes, which include patients with abnormal eating behaviours, the majority of whom are young females. This is the first report highlighting gastric necrosis in a patient with Asperger's syndrome and coincides with a growing recognition of the association between eating disorders and the autistic spectrum. It is also a rare example of patient survival following total gastric necrosis with perforation.

Psychiatria Danubina	2017	Chloe Gamlin	School of Clinical Medicine University of Cambridge, Lucy Cavendish College University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, chloegamlin@live.co.uk.	In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed Asperger's Disorder from the DSM, offering instead the new DSM-5 diagnosis: Autism Spectrum Disorder. This change has been hailed the most controversial exclusion from the DSM, yet unlike the 1973 removal of homosexuality from DSM-III, Asperger's disorder has not been demedicalised. Rather, the disorder has simply been reclassified as part of the DSM-5 Autism Spectrum and therefore retains its fundamental characteristic as a mental disorder owing to its inclusion within the sphere of the DSM.

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle response is a well-established neurophysiological marker of sensorimotor gating ability in psychiatric patients including those with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). PPI has been utilized as an indicator of the central inhibitory function and is potentially linked to the clinical features of this disease. However, it remains inconclusive whether ASD patients exhibit PPI deficits compared with healthy controls. The present meta-analysis aimed to explore the pooled effect sizes of PPI in ASD patients. We searched major electronic databases from 1990 to January 2017. Seven studies, consisting of 21 individual investigations with 135 healthy controls and 99 ASD patients, were obtained. The effect size, calculated as Hedges's g and 95% confidence interval, were estimated. Overall, we found ASD patients exhibited an impaired PPI compared with healthy controls (p = 0.008). Specifically, significant PPI deficits were observed among ASD children/adolescents, compared with their healthy counterparts (p = 0.019). However, differences in PPI responses were not observed among adults. Conclusively, our results reconciled the previous studies and showed that ASD children/adolescents, but not adults, exhibit reduced sensorimotor gating function compared to healthy controls. We also suggest that the parameters of PPI are particularly important and the results should be interpreted with cautions.

When the system of self is explored in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), it is important to measure it via both their own perceptions of the self and their understanding of others' perceptions on themselves at a multidimensional level. This paper reviews existing research in this area using a three-dimension approach. Researchers have found that impairments in the self-system are usually correlated with these individuals' social and cognitive functioning levels: high functioning individuals with ASD who have higher IQ are found to have better awareness of their limitations in social and communication domains than those with lower IQ. Many researchers believe that there

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral impairment in social interactions. Although theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that impairment in the social brain network could be the neural underpinnings of ASD, previous structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in adults with ASD have not provided clear support for this, possibly due to confounding factors, such as language impairments. To further explore this issue, we acquired structural MRI data and analyzed gray matter volume in adults with ASD (

Cognitive Brain Research Unit (CBRU), Department of Psychology and Logopedics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Finland. Pediatric Neurology, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.	Sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) was introduced in 1980s in the field of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Studies indicate that symptoms of SCT are separate from symptoms of ADHD and independently associated with multiple domains of functioning in clinical groups and in typical development. We assessed whether similar pattern would apply to higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Children with higher functioning ASD (N = 55; 5-15 years) were divided into the ASD+High SCT (n = 17), the ASD+Medium SCT (n = 18) and the ASD+Low SCT (n = 20) groups based on parent-rated daydreaming and slowness on the Five to Fifteen questionnaire (FTF). The groups were compared on SCT-related impairments found in previous studies: social skills, academic functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and processing speed. Assessment methods were the FTF, the Development and Well-Being Assessment, and the Coding subtest of the WISC-III. The ADHD symptoms were statistically controlled due to the overlap between SCT and ADHD. The ASD+High SCT and ASD+Medium SCT groups were significantly more likely to have the most pronounced social impairments, and the ASD+High SCT group had significantly higher rate of internalizing disorders compared to the ASD+Low SCT group. Our results suggest that children with higher functioning ASD and high or medium levels of SCT symptoms could be at higher risk for psychosocial impairments than children with higher functioning ASD with low levels of SCT symptoms. Co-occurring ADHD symptoms do not explain the finding. Recognizing SCT symptoms in higher functioning ASD would be important to targeting preventive support.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	Amanda A Webster, Susanne Garvis	1 University of Wollongong, Australia. 2 University of Gothenburg, Sweden.	Ten women with autism spectrum disorder participated in oral interviews in order to share their experiences since their diagnosis and to discuss the factors that had enabled them to achieve success in different aspects of their life. Participants were encouraged to share their perspectives on their success and to discuss the challenges they encountered in their daily lives and how they overcame these. Interviews were analysed using a narrative-themed approach. Participants indicated that both internal and external factors enabled them to achieve success in different aspects of their lives. These included being an agent of change, a changed identity after diagnosis, experiencing the belief of others in their capability and seeing themselves as a mentor to others. Their experiences with overcoming obstacles in their lives enabled them to develop self-efficacy and to shape their own success.

However, this clinical categorization largely overlaps with the presence or absence of a speech onset delay which is associated with clinical, cognitive, and neural differences. It is unknown whether these different speech development pathways and associated cognitive differences are involved in the heterogeneity of the restricted interests that characterize autistic adults.

Frontiers in psychology	2017	Elaine C Zachi, Thiago L Costa, Mirella T S Barboni, Marcelo F Costa, Daniela M O Bonci, Dora F Ventura	Department of Experimental Psychology, Nucleus for Neuroscience and Behavior, Institute of Psychology, University of São PauloSão Paulo, Brazil.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impairments in social/communication abilities and restricted behaviors. The present study aims to examine color vision discrimination in ASD children and adolescents without intellectual disability. The participants were also subdivided in order to compare color vision thresholds of autistic participants and those who achieved diagnostic criteria for Asperger Syndrome (AS). Nine subjects with autism, 11 participants with AS and 36 typically developing children and adolescents participated in the study. Color vision was assessed by the Cambridge Color Test (CCT). The Trivector protocol was administered to determine color discrimination thresholds along the protan, deutan, and tritan color confusion lines. Data from ASD participants were compared to tolerance limits for 90% of the population with 90% probability obtained from controls thresholds. Of the 20 ASD individuals examined, 6 (30%) showed color vision losses. Elevated color discrimination thresholds were found in 3/9 participants with autism and in 3/11 AS participants. Diffuse and tritan deficits were found. Mechanisms for chromatic losses may be either at the retinal level and/or reflect reduced cortical integration.

While behavioural difficulties in facial emotion recognition (FER) have been observed in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), behavioural studies alone are not suited to elucidate the specific nature of FER challenges in ASD. Eye tracking (ET) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide insights in to the attentional and neurological correlates of performance, and may therefore provide insight in to the mechanisms underpinning FER in ASD. Given that these processes develop over the course of the developmental trajectory, there is a need to synthesise findings in regard to the developmental stages to determine how the maturation of these systems may impact FER in ASD. We conducted a systematic review of fifty-four studies investigating ET or EEG meeting inclusion criteria. Findings indicate divergence of visual processing pathways in individuals with ASD. Altered function of the social brain in ASD impacts the processing of facial emotion across the developmental trajectory, resulting in observable differences in ET and EEG outcomes.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2017	Grace I P Hancock, Mark A Stokes, Gary B Mesibov	Faculty of Health, Deakin University, 221 Burwood highway, Burwood, VIC, 3030, Australia. Division TEACCH, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.	Socio-sexual functioning encompasses an individual's interests, behaviors, and knowledge with respect to sexual, romantic, and social aspects of life. An individual's understanding of these domains is developed through a range of informal and formal avenues of sexual health education. The current model demonstrated this and proposed that, compared to typically developing individuals, those with ASD develop socio-sexual functioning differently due to having less peer engagement, less relationship experience, more parental guidance, greater use of online materials, receive less school-based sexual health education, and more support from wellbeing services. Systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature revealed that individuals with ASD have greater difficultly adhering to privacy norms, engage in less social behavior, are described as engaging in less appropriate sexual behavior, have greater concerns about themselves, and receive less sexual health education. Having fewer opportunities for appropriate informal and formal sexual health education leaves them at a double disadvantage from others who are receiving this information from both of these avenues. Some of the current meta-analytic results are cautioned by large l-square statistics which suggest that a degree of variance is being caused by extraneous factors. Further empirical research in this area is needed to overcome current design and sample limitations. Finally, the Sexual Behavior Scale was the most commonly utilized tool in the meta-analyzed studies, thus comprehensive evaluation of its functioning is warranted. The importance of work in this area is highlighted by the central role of social and sexual wellbeing on one's quality of life.

Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki	2017	Chr Anomitri, H Lazaratou	Child and Adolescent Unit, Community Mental Health Byron Kesariani, 1st Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece.	"This article is an overview of the literature on Asperger's syndrome and schizophrenia and aim to discuss their similarities and differences. Eugen Bleuler who associated the terms ""schizophrenia"" and ""autism"" a century ago, viewed autism as a form of solitude of schizophrenic patients representing withdrawal from reality. Ever since, there has been confusion as to the boundaries between these conditions. Nowadays recent research, from a variety of perspectives-genomics, neurodevelopment, psychiatry, etc. has given new information on these conditions. It is easier to demarcate these two disorders at the extremes, but it is extremely difficult dissociating milder forms of both disorders. Asperger's syndrome (AS), is considered to be a continuous and lifelong disorder with strong heritability, present from early childhood. It is included within the category of autism spectrum disorders and it is usually diagnosed in childhood. Patients with Asperger syndrome are often diagnosed late or they are considered as having schizophrenia. Misdiagnosing Asperger syndrome creates severe problems by preventing effective therapy. A lot of clinical characteristics of Asperger's syndrome are also present in schizophrenia, such as impaired social interaction, disabilities in communication and restricted interests. On the other side some clinical features may facilitate the differential diagnosis, such as the younger age at onset, family history of pervasive developmental disorders, pragmatic aspects of language use, lack of imagination, ect. It is known that symptoms of Asperger's syndrome have some overlap with those of schizophrenia, but less is known about comorbidity between these two syndromes. It is still a question whether autism spectrum disorders in young children can increase the risk for the development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, later in life. Both disorders are of neurodevelopmental origin and genetic factors are prominent. In both neurocognitive deficits as well as deficits in social cognition and social functioning are marked. The boundaries between AS and schizophrenia are still not clear even if this distinction is necessary for the appropriate treatment of the patient and his family. For the writing of the literature review, the following electronic databases were used: PubMed, Scopus, Psycinfo, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The key words used were: Asperger's syndrome, schizophrenia, children and adolescents, differential diagnosis, autism spectrum disorders."

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2018	Brett Heasman, Alex Gillespie	The London School of Economics and Political Science, UK.	Misunderstandings are social in nature, always having two sides. Yet the misunderstandings experienced by people with Asperger's syndrome are usually studied in terms of the individual with a diagnosis, with less emphasis on social relations. We use a two-sided methodology to map out misunderstandings within 22 dyads (n = 44) consisting of people with Asperger's syndrome and their family members. Both sides of the relationship were asked about 12 topics in terms of one's rating of Self, one's rating of Other and one's predicted rating by Other. The findings show that people with Asperger's are able to predict lower scores from family members, despite disagreeing with their view, and that family members often over-estimate the extent to which their relatives with Asperger's syndrome are egocentrically anchored in their own perspective. The research demonstrates that a two-sided methodology is viable, and it uses it to identify how representations of Asperger's syndrome can both support and hinder social understanding within relationships affected by Asperger's.

Revista de neurologia	2017	D Garrido, M Garcia-Fernandez, R Garcia-Retamero, G Carballo	Universidad de Granada, Granada, Espana.	Following the adoption of the new international diagnosis classification from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been established as a dimensional category that includes other disorders that were previously considered as separate entities. Previous research has shown that some people with this disorder exhibit different communicative and linguistic profiles. Therefore, contradictory results could be found among people who receive the same diagnosis.
28666391	doi: 10.1177/1362361317703090	The combined impact of social support and perceived stress on quality of life in adults with autism spectrum disorder and without intellectual disability.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2018	Lauren Bishop-Fitzpatrick, Carla A Mazefsky, Shaun M Eack	2 University of Pittsburgh, USA. 1 University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA.	Identifying modifiable correlates of good quality of life in adults with autism spectrum disorder is of paramount importance for intervention development as the population of adults with autism spectrum disorder increases. This study sought to examine social support and perceived stress as potential modifiable correlates of quality of life in adults with autism spectrum disorder. We hypothesized that adults with autism spectrum disorder without co-occurring intellectual disabilities ( N = 40; aged 18-44 years) would report lower levels of social support and quality of life than typical community volunteers who were matched for age, sex, and race ( N = 25). We additionally hypothesized that social support would buffer the effect of perceived stress on quality of life in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Results indicated that adults with autism spectrum disorder reported significantly lower levels of social support and quality of life than matched typical community volunteers. In addition, findings showed significant direct effects of social support and perceived stress on quality of life in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Social support did not buffer the effect of perceived stress on quality of life. Interventions that teach adults with autism spectrum disorder skills to help them better manage stress and cultivate supportive social relationships have the potential to improve quality of life.

Journal of child & adolescent trauma	2018	Michelle F Wright	1Department of Psychology, Child Study Center, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, State College, PA 16801 USA.	The purpose of the present study was to examine the buffering effect of parental mediation of technology use and social support from parents on the association between cyber victimization and depression, assessed over one year. Participants were 113 7th through 9th graders from the Midwestern United States (age ranged from 12 to 17 years old; 86% were male) who were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. They completed questionnaires on their perceptions of parental mediation of technology use, perceived social support from parents, and self-reported face-to-face and cyber victimization and depression at Wave 1. One year later, at Wave 2, they completed a questionnaire on their depression. Results indicated that the associations between cyber victimization and depression were more negative at higher levels of perceived parental technology mediation and social support, while these associations were more negative at lower levels of these variables, after controlling for face-to-face victimization and Wave 1 depression.

The transition from DSM-IV to DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sparked considerable concern about the potential implications of these changes. This study was designed to address limitations of prior studies by prospectively examining the concordance of DSM-IV and final DSM-5 criteria on a consecutive sample of 439 children referred for autism diagnostic evaluations. Concordance and discordance were assessed using a consistent diagnostic battery. DSM-5 criteria demonstrated excellent overall specificity and good sensitivity relative to DSM-IV criteria. Sensitivity and specificity were strongest for children meeting DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder, but poor for those meeting criteria for Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder. Higher IQ, older age, female sex, and less pronounced ASD symptoms were associated with greater discordance.

The symptomatology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) can make driving risky, but little is known about the on-road driving behaviour of individuals with ASD. This study assessed and compared the on-road driving performance of drivers with and without ASD, and explored how the symptomatology of ASD hinders or facilitates on-road driving performance. Sixteen drivers with ASD and 21 typically-developed drivers participated in the study. Drivers with ASD underperformed in vehicle manoeuvring, especially at left-turns, right-turns and pedestrian crossings. However, drivers with ASD outperformed the TD group in aspects related to rule-following such as using the indicator at roundabouts and checking for cross-traffic when approaching intersections. Drivers with ASD in the current study presented with a range of capabilities and weaknesses during driving.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are increasingly entering institutions of higher education. However, many are not prepared for the academic and social demands of postsecondary environments. Although studies have evaluated academic and social interventions for children and adolescents with ASD, little research exists on the college population. The current study utilized a multiple baseline across participants design to evaluate the effectiveness of a writing learning strategy on the writing performance of three college students with ASD. Results indicated that the quality of writing performance improved following strategy instruction. In addition, participants were able to generalize strategy use to content specific writing tasks.

Clinical genetic testing (CGT) of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may have positive and negative effects. Knowledge about parents' attitudes is needed to ensure good involvement of caregivers, which is crucial for accurate diagnosis and effective clinical management. This study aimed to assess parents' attitudes toward CGT for ASD. Parent members of the Norwegian Autism Society were given a previously untested questionnaire and 1455 answered. Linear regression analyses were conducted to evaluate contribution of parent and child characteristics to attitude statements. Provided it could contribute to a casual explanation of their child's ASD, 76% would undergo CGT. If it would improve the possibilities for early interventions, 74% were positive to CGT. Between 49-67% agreed that CGT could have a negative impact on health insurance, increase their concern for the child's future and cause family conflicts. Parents against CGT (9%) were less optimistic regarding positive effects, but not more concerned with negative impacts. The severity of the children's ASD diagnosis had a weak positive association with parent's positive attitudes to CGT (

Performance of a group of 35 youth and adults with High-Functioning Autism (HFA) was compared with a typical developing (TD) group on three Advanced Theory of Mind tests. The distinction between the social-cognitive and social-perceptual components of Theory of Mind was also explored. The HFA group had more difficulties in all tasks. Performance on the two social-cognitive tests was highly correlated in the HFA group, but these were not related with the social-perceptual component. These results suggest that the youth with HFA have difficulties on all the components of social knowledge but may be using different underlying cognitive abilities depending on the nature of the task.

BackgroundMaternal pre-pregnancy obesity may impair infant neuropsychological development, but it is unclear whether intrauterine or confounding factors drive this association.MethodsWe assessed whether maternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with neuropsychological development in 1,827 Spanish children. At 5 years, cognitive and psychomotor development was assessed using McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms using the Criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, and autism spectrum disorder symptoms using the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic factors and maternal intelligence quotient. We used paternal obesity as negative control exposure as it involves the same source of confounding than maternal obesity.ResultsThe percentage of obese mothers and fathers was 8% and 12%, respectively. In unadjusted models, children of obese mothers had lower scores than children of normal weight mothers in all McCarthy subscales. After adjustment, only the verbal subscale remained statistically significantly reduced (β: -2.8; 95% confidence interval: -5.3, -0.2). No associations were observed among obese fathers. Maternal and paternal obesity were associated with an increase in ADHD-related symptoms. Parental obesity was not associated with autism symptoms.ConclusionMaternal pre-pregnancy obesity was associated with a reduction in offspring verbal scores at pre-school age.

International clinical psychopharmacology	2017	Pavel Golubchik, Michal Rapaport, Abraham Weizman		The objective of this study was to assess the response of anxiety and depression symptoms to methylphenidate (MPH) treatment in patients with Asperger syndrome (AS) combined with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A group of 12 patients with AS/ADHD, aged 8-18 years, received 12 weeks of MPH treatment. The severities of ADHD, anxiety, and depression symptoms were assessed by means of the ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD-RS), Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, and the Children's Depression Inventory. The severity of ADHD and depression symptoms was reduced significantly (P<0.0003 and P=0.046, respectively). No improvement in total anxiety symptoms was found, but a significant reduction was obtained in the school-related subscale of the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (P=0.0054). A positive correlation was found between the reductions in ADHD-RS and Children's Depression Inventory scores (r=0.59, P=0.039). MPH treatment may be safe, tolerable, and effective in alleviating depression and school-related anxiety symptoms in patients with AS and ADHD.

Executive function (EF) deficits in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are ubiquitous and understudied. Further, there are no effective, neuroscience-based treatments to address this impairing feature of ASD. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has demonstrated promise in addressing EF deficits in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. This article will outline the design of a novel randomized-controlled trial of bilateral, 20 Hz, rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for treatment of EF deficits in ASD that is currently ongoing. We describe prior therapeutic rTMS research for ASD and prior rTMS trials targeting EFs in adult neuropsychiatric disorders. A neurophysiological rationale for rTMS treatment of EF deficits in ASD is presented.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disease characterized by difficulties in social communication, unusually restricted, repetitive behavior and interests, and specific abnormalities in language and perception. The precise etiology of ASD is still unknown and probably heterogeneous. In a subgroup of patients, toxic environmental exposure might lead to an imbalance between oxidative stress and anti-oxidant systems. Previous serum and postmortem studies measuring levels of glutathione (GSH), the main cellular free radical scavenger in the brain, have supported the hypothesis that this compound might play a role in the pathophysiology of autism.
28296371		[Autism spectrum disorder: Etiological, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects].	Revista medica del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social	2017	César Reynoso, María José Rangel, Virgilio Melgar		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was described for the first time in 1943 by Leo Kanner, and since 2004, 18 490 articles in the subject have been published, which in turn have been cited 48 416 times.1 Almost half of these publications come from the United States of America and the vast maority of the efforts to improve the quality of life of these patients have taken place in developed countries. This disorder consists of an inability to acquire social and emotional skills during early development that progressively results in variable degrees of social adaptation discapacity. The etiology is multifactorial and includes functional and structural neurological abnormalities, some of them with putative genetic and/or epigenetic origin. There is an alarming lack of knowledge in the subject among health care professionals. The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the most relevant historical, diagnostic and therapeutic aspects of ASD.

Frontiers in neuroscience	2017	André Fujita, Maciel C Vidal, Daniel Y Takahashi	Department of Psychology and Princeton Neuroscience Institute, Princeton University Princeton, NJ, USA. Department of Computer Science, Institute of Mathematics and Statistics, University of São Paulo São Paulo, Brazil.	One major problem in neuroscience is the comparison of functional brain networks of different populations, e.g., distinguishing the networks of controls and patients. Traditional algorithms are based on search for isomorphism between networks, assuming that they are deterministic. However, biological networks present randomness that cannot be well modeled by those algorithms. For instance, functional brain networks of distinct subjects of the same population can be different due to individual characteristics. Moreover, networks of subjects from different populations can be generated through the same stochastic process. Thus, a better hypothesis is that networks are generated by random processes. In this case, subjects from the same group are samples from the same random process, whereas subjects from different groups are generated by distinct processes. Using this idea, we developed a statistical test called ANOGVA to test whether two or more populations of graphs are generated by the same random graph model. Our simulations' results demonstrate that we can precisely control the rate of false positives and that the test is powerful to discriminate random graphs generated by different models and parameters. The method also showed to be robust for unbalanced data. As an example, we applied ANOGVA to an fMRI dataset composed of controls and patients diagnosed with autism or Asperger. ANOGVA identified the cerebellar functional sub-network as statistically different between controls and autism (

Pharmacotherapy	2017	Belinda M Cuomo, Sharmila Vaz, Elinda Ai Lim Lee, Craig Thompson, Jessica M Rogerson, Torbjorn Falkmer	School of Occupational Therapy & Social Work, Curtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.	Sleep problems are common in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This meta-synthesis collated eight previously published systematic reviews examining the efficacy of sleep interventions in children with ASD in an attempt to present a clear analysis of trialed interventions. The collated reviews consider five major groups of sleep interventions for children with ASD: melatonin therapy, pharmacologic treatments other than melatonin, behavioral interventions, parent education/education programs, and alternative therapies (massage therapy, aromatherapy, and multivitamin and iron supplementation). These eight reviews were based on 38 original studies and address the efficacy of interventions across 17 sleep problem domains. The results of this meta-synthesis suggest that no single intervention is effective across all sleep problems in children with ASD. However, melatonin, behavioral interventions, and parent education/education program interventions appear the most effective at ameliorating multiple domains of sleep problems compared with other interventions. Due to the heterogeneous causative factors and presentations of disordered sleep, further research into the effectiveness of sleep interventions may target specific phenotypic subgroups rather than a broad analysis across the general ASD population. Similarly, future research needs to consider the efficacy of different polytherapeutic approaches in order to provide clinicians with evidence to inform best practice. In the meantime, this review supports clinicians' decision making for a majority of the identified sleep problems in the ASD population.
28256681		[Deconstructing Kanner].	Revista de neurologia	2017	J Artigas-Pallares, I Paula-Perez	Universidad de Barcelona, Edifici Llevant, 08035 Barcelona, Espana. Centre Medic Psyncron, Sabadell, Espana.	Kanner, in 1943, and Asperger, in 1944, published papers that have been considered the first descriptions of autism. Kanner is acknowledged as having been the first to recognise this condition, while Asperger is attributed with the identification of a milder form of autism which has been denominated Asperger's syndrome. Kanner's paper played an important role in the development of the conceptualisation of autism due to its being published in the United States, where it became popular in the field of child psychiatry. In contrast, Asperger's work, written in German during the period dominated by Nazism, was practically ignored until almost four decades later. A review of the historical data, mostly collected by Silberman, reveals that Kanner had first-hand knowledge of the work on autism that Asperger had begun ten years earlier. Moreover, on re-reading and analysing the pioneering publications it becomes clear that the contributions made by Asperger are still fully valid today, to the point of having intuited a complex polygenic aetiology and that it would fit in perfectly with autism spectrum disorder in the DSM-5.

Herz	2017	I Kruck	Cardio Centrum Ludwigsburg Bietigheim, Asperger Str. 48, 71634, Ludwigsburg, Deutschland. I.Kruck@cclb.de.	Cardiac dysfunction caused by cardiotoxic treatment can appear at any time during or after therapy and sometimes even after years. To evaluate systolic left ventricular (LV) function assessment of the ejection fraction (EF), especially using 3D technology, is the established base value for cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). It has been found that additional analysis of the LV function using deformation imaging is a more accurate and sensitive tool for detecting subclinical systolic LV dysfunction. Diastolic function parameters are not recommended for screening. The decision to modify oncological treatment and/or to begin specific cardiac treatment after detecting LV dysfunction is based on known data taking both the prognosis and quality of life into consideration and performed in individual cases by a cardio-oncological team of experts. There is a widely held consensus that these patients should be examined in an echocardiographic laboratory which has the appropriate equipment and diagnostic expertise. The lack of multicenter studies and the paucity of outcome data do not yet answer the question if echocardiography is carried out too early or too late. Recommendations on the frequency of standardized follow-up examinations and standardized echocardiographic parameter vary between the specialist societies. Although increased morbidity and mortality due to cardiotoxic treatment are now well known facts, too few patients undergo appropriate examinations.

Psychiatric genetics	2017	Aurore Curie, Gaëtan Lesca, Gérald Bussy, Sabine Manificat, Valérie Arnaud, Sibylle Gonzalez, Olivier Revol, Alain Calender, Daniel Gérard, Vincent des Portes		Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) deleterious variants, which are responsible for Rett syndrome in girls, are involved in a wide spectrum of developmental disabilities in males. A neuropsychiatric phenotype without intellectual disability is uncommon in patients with MECP2 deleterious variants. We report on two dizygotic twins with an MECP2-related psychiatric disorder without intellectual disability. Neuropsychological and psychiatric phenotype assessments were performed, and a genetic analysis was carried out. Both patients fulfilled the Pervasive Developmental Disorder criteria on Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Asperger syndrome criteria on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV). One patient developed early-onset schizophrenia (DSM-IV criteria) with two acute psychotic episodes, the latest one following corticosteroids and sodium valproate intake, with major hyperammonemia. A novel MECP2 gene transversion c.491 G>T [p.(Ser164Ile)] was found in both twins. Pathogenicity of this variant was considered on the basis of strong clinical and molecular data. The underlying molecular basis of neuropsychiatric disorders may have important consequences on genetic counseling and therapeutic strategies.

Although, the quest to understand emotional processing in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) has led to an impressive number of studies, the picture that emerges from this research remains inconsistent. Some studies find that Typically Developing (TD) individuals outperform those with ASD in emotion recognition tasks, others find no such difference. In this paper, we move beyond focusing on potential group differences in behaviour to answer what we believe is a more pressing question: do individuals with ASD use the same mechanisms to process emotional cues? To this end, we rely on model-based analyses of participants' accuracy during an emotion categorisation task in which displays of anger and fear are paired with direct vs. averted gaze. Behavioural data of 20 ASD and 20 TD adolescents revealed that the ASD group displayed lower overall performance. Yet, gaze direction had a similar impact on emotion categorisation in both groups, i.e. improved accuracy for salient combinations (anger-direct, fear-averted). Critically, computational modelling of participants' behaviour reveals that the same mechanism, i.e. increased perceptual sensitivity, underlies the contextual impact of gaze in both groups. We discuss the specific experimental conditions that may favour emotion processing and the automatic integration of contextual information in ASD.

School of Psychology, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK. Electronic address: dscroggie03@qub.ac.uk. School of Psychology, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, UK.	There is increasing evidence to suggest both a symptomatic overlap and a clinically significant degree of co-occurrence between Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia but the nature of such relationships remain unclear. We reviewed the literature reporting prevalence rates of Autistic-like Traits (ALTs) and ASD in populations with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder. A search of three large databases was conducted and from this seven studies met the criteria for inclusion. The point prevalence rates for ALTs ranged from 9.6% to 61%, whilst the prevalence rates for diagnosed ASD ranged from <1% to 52% across outpatient and inpatient populations. This suggests that prevalence rates of ALTs and ASD in psychosis populations are much higher than in the general population. This has important implications regarding future research, and clinical implications in terms of ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2017	Randall Phelps, Robert Nickel, Debi Eisert, Martin T Stein		Robbie is a 4-year-old boy whose parents are concerned about his speech, social skills, and repetitive behaviors. He has poor articulation; at time, he is difficult to understand. On the other hand, he has a fair vocabulary, and he has good intent to communicate. He is generally able to communicate his needs and wants. He likes to tell his parents about his day.When he begins the day at preschool, Robbie initially stands by himself and watches. He slowly warms up and eventually participates in activities. He engages in parallel play or follows other children. He knows names of children at preschool, and he is well liked. He is affectionate with his parents.When Robbie is excited, he wiggles his fingers, flaps his arms, and grimaces. He can be quite rigid; for example, he gets very distressed when his mother sets his cup down on his right side instead of his left. However, in general, Robbie has a sunny personality. He likes to watch children's television shows. He pretends plays with action figures. Robbie is an only child who lives with both parents. His mother works full-time, and his father is in home with Robbie during the day.When examined in the office, Robbie had a bright affect, good eye contact, and social referencing. He demonstrated good communicative intent, but poor articulation and some jargoning. He frequently wiggled his fingers and flapped his hands with excitement. Robbie had a borderline score on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule.During the visit, the pediatrician noted that Robbie's father was rather quiet and rarely responded to questions. When he did respond, he had a monotone quality to his voice. He maintained either a flat or nervous affect throughout the visit. He made limited eye contact, and occasionally he stared excessively.

Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2017	Randall Phelps, Debra Eisert, Susan Schulz, Marilyn Augustyn		"Alex is a 9-year-old boy brought to you, his primary care provider, for a ""fifth opinion."" You have cared for Alex since he was adopted from a Romanian orphanage at 3 years of age. He has been physically healthy with normal growth parameters and no evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alex has long-standing history of social difficulties, impulsivity, lying, controlling, manipulative behaviors, violent outbursts at home with subsequent lack of remorse, and excessive chatter. You referred Alex to an interdisciplinary child development clinic 2 years ago, where he was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He was noted to have normal cognitive and language skills. Attachment therapy, stimulant therapy, and school accommodations for ADHD were recommended.Alex received some individual counseling with the school psychologist for a year after the first evaluation, with little improvement in core behaviors. The following year, Alex established care with a psychiatrist and a private counselor. The psychiatrist prescribed a succession of stimulants, each of which worked for only a short time and then had waning effect. The counselor worked with Alex and his parents on managing Alex's behavior, which the family reports has been somewhat helpful.Alex's parents express great frustration and sadness that parenting Alex has been such an ongoing struggle since he was adopted. They note that Alex is superficially friendly, chatty, and charming, with everyone he encounters, including strangers, but he never progresses past such superficial interaction, even with his adoptive parents. The parents express that they are deeply wounded that Alex is not more loving and is not more appreciative of the fact that they rescued him from the orphanage.His parents asked his pediatric clinician about Autism as they observe Alex's lack of real affection and social connection with parents or peers. They also note that Alex has difficulty verbalizing his feelings and that he lies frequently, chatters tangentially, and he can watch the Discovery channel for hours. A neurologist, to whom Alex was referred to evaluate staring spells, reassured the family that the spells did not seem to be epilepsy and also diagnosed Alex with ""Asperger's syndrome."" The school psychologist, after 2 years of equivocation, recently made Alex eligible for autism spectrum services.During the interview and examination, Alex is funny, friendly, and a bit silly. He uses normal eye contact, seems to enjoy the neuromotor examination, and is eager to show you his cool, new handshake. He engages in easy banter, using normal vernacular and prosody. After the visit, you call the therapist to express your opinion that the RAD diagnosis is valid after all and to ask whether the family is engaged in attachment therapy. The therapist refutes the RAD diagnosis, endorsing Asperger's syndrome (AS) instead and notes that Alex is making good progress in school and in therapy, where he is learning pragmatic skills and basic social skills with the use of social stories.Where do you head next?"

In SCZ, the link between symptomatic dimensions and social cognition deficits remains unclear. The Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC) test, available in several languages including English, investigates mental state attribution capabilities in complex interpersonal situations. After its translation into French, we used MASC to direct compare social cognition in 36 young participants with SCZ to 19 with ASD and 20 healthy controls (HC) matched for gender, age (18-25y.o.) and level of education. The MASC discriminated each group from the others, patients with SCZ exhibiting difficulties compared to ASD (MASC total score 28.1 (4) and 24.2 (6.6), respectively; p<.001). In the whole sample, MASC scores were inversely correlated with autistic traits, evaluated by autism quotient, and with disorganization symptoms. Finally, in SCZ, over-mentalizing difficulties were correlated with age at disease onset. Our results demonstrate the validity of the French version of the MASC and bring direct evidence supporting the hypothesis of a phenotypic continuum between autism and schizophrenia.

Research in developmental disabilities	2017	R S You, W Serniclaes, D Rider, N Chabane	Centre Cantonal de l'Autisme, Université de Lausanne, Switzerland. Laboratoire de Psychologie de la Perception, Université Paris Descartes, France; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), France; UNESCOG, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.

Laboratoire de Psychologie de la Perception, Université Paris Descartes, France.	Previous studies have claimed to show deficits in the perception of speech sounds in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The aim of the current study was to clarify the nature of such deficits. Children with ASD might only exhibit a lesser amount of precision in the perception of phoneme categories (CPR deficit). However, these children might further present an allophonic mode of speech perception, similar to the one evidenced in dyslexia, characterised by enhanced discrimination of acoustic differences within phoneme categories. Allophonic perception usually gives rise to a categorical perception (CP) deficit, characterised by a weaker coherence between discrimination and identification of speech sounds. The perceptual performance of ASD children was compared to that of control children of the same chronological age. Identification and discrimination data were collected for continua of natural vowels, synthetic vowels, and synthetic consonants. Results confirmed that children with ASD exhibit a CPR deficit for the three stimulus continua. These children further exhibited a trend toward allophonic perception that was, however, not accompanied by the usual CP deficit. These findings confirm that the commonly found CPR deficit is also present in ASD. Whether children with ASD also present allophonic perception requires further investigations.
28075089		Autism Spectrum Disorder: Primary Care Principles.	American family physician	2016	Kristian E Sanchack, Craig A Thomas	Naval Hospital Pensacola, Pensacola, FL, USA. Naval Hospital Jacksonville, Jacksonville, FL, USA.	Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulty with social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., created an umbrella diagnosis that includes several previously separate conditions: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for autism spectrum disorder in children 18 to 30 months of age in whom the disorder is not suspected; however, there is a growing body of evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention based on applied behavior analysis improves cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills. Therefore, early identification of autism spectrum disorder is important, and experts recommend the use of a validated screening tool at 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Medications can be used as adjunctive treatment for maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychiatric conditions, but there is no single medical therapy that is effective for all symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Prognosis is heavily affected by the severity of diagnosis and the presence of intellectual disability. Children with optimal outcomes receive earlier, more intensive behavioral interventions and less pharmacologic treatment.

Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) is a noninvasive neuroimaging method to quantify biochemical metabolites in vivo and it can serve as a powerful tool to monitor neurobiochemical profiles in the brain. Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a type of autism spectrum disorder, which is characterized by impaired social skills and restrictive, repetitive patterns of interest and activities, while intellectual levels and language skills are relatively preserved. Despite clinical aspects have been well-characterized, neurometabolic profiling in the brain of AS remains to be clear. The present study used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to investigate whether pediatric AS is associated with measurable neurometabolic abnormalities that can contribute new information on the neurobiological underpinnings of the disorder.

La Tunisie medicale	2016	Arwa Ben Amor, Soumeyya Halayem, Maissa Touati, Ahlem Belhadj, Riadh Gouider, Ridha Mrad, Asma Bouden		Background - Based on the recognized principles of assessment of autistic disorders, the child and adolescent psychiatry department in Razi Hospital developed an assessment unit with diagnostic as well as therapeutic roles. The aim of this work was to examine its functioning and to analyze the parents' perceptions about the unit services. Methods - We gathered the parental satisfaction about the unit by the means of a hetero-questionnaire. Results - Fifty-two parents of children evaluated within the unit were included.  Patients had received the diagnosis of Autistic Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorders Not Otherwise Specified and Asperger Syndrome in accordance with DSM IV criteria, and than that of Autism Spectrum Disorder after DSM 5 publication. The overall satisfaction rate was 63%. Most parents (84.6%) rated the Psycho Educative Profile examination positively, 75% appreciated the neurological examination and the final report steps, 55.8% appreciated step of the Autism Diagnostic Interview revised and 42.3% the genetic exploration. 67% of the parents reported an improvement of their child following the evaluation. This improvement was attributed to the unit in 57.7% of cases. Parents whose children did not have associated disorders such as intellectual disability (p = 0.02), aggressive behavior (p = 0.04), affective disorder (p = 0.01) and sleep-related disorders (p = 0.03) were the most satisfied. Parents of children with epilepsy comorbidity were the least satisfied (p <10-3). 96% of parents suggested repeating the assessment once a year. Conclusion - Assessment units are based on international recommendations. However, it would be interesting to adapt assessments and orientation to the parents' expectations.

The transition from high school to post-secondary education and work is difficult for adolescents on the autism spectrum. Transition planning can be an effective way of supporting adolescents on the autism spectrum to prepare for leaving school and to succeed in obtaining employment; however, there is a need for an autism-specific transition planning program with proven effectiveness. This paper describes a trial protocol for evaluating the Better OutcOmes & Successful Transitions for Autism (BOOST-A™); an online interactive program that empowers adolescents on the autism spectrum to plan their transition from school to further study, training, or employment.

Biological Psychology Unit, Department of Psychology, University of Graz, Univ.-Platz 2, 8010, Graz, Austria. Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy A, General Hospital Hall, Tirol, Austria.	Deficits in specific executive domains are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorder; however, age-related improvements in executive functions (reflecting prefrontal maturational changes) have been reported even in individuals diagnosed with autism. The current study examined two components of cognitive flexibility (inhibition of prepotent responses and memory monitoring/updating) by using a random-motor-generation task (MPT) in a group of 23 boys with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 23 matched healthy controls. We found poorer inhibition and more repetitive responses in younger AS children solely, but comparable memory monitoring/updating skills across groups. Overall, our findings correspond well with previous studies and reveal that even in AS specific EFs may improve with age and, thus, call for a more differentiated view of executive (dys) function profiles in children diagnosed with AS. Tests such as the random-motor-generation task may help to disentangle more specific processes of executive deficits in autism spectrum disorder as compared to the more classical tests.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), once considered to be rare, are now reaching prevalence estimates of 1% and higher. Studies conducted in North America indicate large racial/ethnic disparities in the diagnosis of ASDs. Others show, that immigrant children have similar prevalence rates of ASDs as native children, although they are diagnosed later compared with native children. In relation to a EU funded network action, Enhancing the Scientific Study of Early Autism, it was considered important to review the literature on this subject.

The aim was to describe the occupational transition process to upper secondary school, further education and/or work, and to discover what support influences the process from the perspectives of young adults with Asperger syndrome or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This qualitative study was performed in Sweden and comprised interviews with 15 young adults recruited from community based day centres. Support influencing the process included: occupational transition preparation in compulsory school, practical work experience in a safe environment, and support beyond the workplace. The overall understanding shows that the occupational transition process was a longitudinal one starting as early as in middle school, and continuing until the young adults obtained and were able to remain in employment or further education.

Individuals who have autism spectrum disorders (ASD) commonly experience social anxiety (SA). Disentangling SA symptoms from core ASD characteristics is complex, partly due to diagnostic overshadowing and co-occurring alexithymia. Causal and maintaining mechanisms for SA in ASD are underexplored, but it is feasible that there is an ASD specificity to the clinical presentation, with implications for the development of targeted treatments.

Department of Educational Studies and Research, University of Southern Mississippi. Texas Tech University.	"In analyzing data from the National Database for Autism Research, we utilized Mokken scaling techniques as a means of creating a more effective and efficient screening procedure for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) via the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). With a sample of 1,040, approximately 80% (n = 827) of the sample were males while approximately 20% (n = 213) were females. In regard to ethnicity, approximately 68% of the sample were White/Caucasian, while 7% were African American, 16% were Hispanic, 4% were Asian, and 1% were Native American or American Indian. As the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) states that, ""individuals with a well-established DSM-IV diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified should be given the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder,"" (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, p. 51), the primary labeling difference between the DSM-IV and the DSM-5 would appear to be in identifying social communication disorder as a newly introduced disorder in the DSM-5, which we discuss. Though school psychologists are not dependent on the DSM to the same extent as clinical psychologists to provide services, school psychology is invested in the effective and efficient assessment of ASD. The current study demonstrates how Mokken scaling procedures may be utilized with respect to ASD identification via the SCQ as well as providing information regarding the prevalence of potential social communication disorder as a new disorder and its discrimination with ASD.

Autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia have been variously characterized as separate nosological entities with overlapping deficits in social cognition or diametrical extremes of a phenotypic continuum. This study aimed to determine how these models apply to comparative morphometric data. MRI scans of the brain were obtained in 49 subjects with schizophrenia, 20 subjects with autism and 39 healthy controls. Images were parcellated into 40 Brodmann areas and entered into repeated-measures ANOVA for between-group comparison of global and localized gray and white matter volumes. A pattern of lower gray mater volumes and greater white matter volumes was found in subjects with schizophrenia in comparison to subjects with autism. For both gray and white matter, this pattern was most pronounced in regions associated with motor-premotor and anterior frontal cortex, anterior cingulate, fusiform, superior and middle temporal gyri. Patient groups tended to diverge from healthy controls in opposite directions, with greater-than-normal gray matter volumes and lower-than-normal white matter volumes in subjects with autism and reversed patterns in subjects with schizophrenia. White matter reductions in subjects with autism were seen in posterior frontal lobe and along the cingulate arch. Normal hemispheric asymmetry in the temporal lobe was effaced in subjects with autism and schizophrenia, especially in the latter. Nearly identical distribution of changes and diametrically divergent volumetry suggest that autism and schizophrenia may occupy opposite extremes of the same cognitive continuum.

Existing literature on the profile of executive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorder showed inconsistent results. Age, comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and cognitive abilities appeared to play a role in confounding the picture. Previous meta-analyses have focused on a few components of executive functions. This meta-analysis attempted to delineate the profile of deficit in several components of executive functioning in children and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD). Ninety-eight English published case-control studies comparing children and adolescents with HFASD with typically developing controls using well-known neuropsychological measures to assess executive functions were included. Results showed that children and adolescents with HFASD were moderately impaired in verbal working memory (g = 0.67), spatial working memory (g = 0.58), flexibility (g = 0.59), planning (g = 0.62), and generativity (g = 0.60) except for inhibition (g = 0.41). Subgroup analysis showed that impairments were still significant for flexibility (g = 0.57-0.61), generativity (g = 0.52-0.68), and working memory (g = 0.49-0.56) in a sample of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subjects without comorbid ADHD or when the cognitive abilities of the ASD group and the control group were comparable. This meta-analysis confirmed the presence of executive dysfunction in children and adolescents with HFASD. These deficits are not solely accounted for by the effect of comorbid ADHD and the general cognitive abilities. Our results support the executive dysfunction hypothesis and contribute to the clinical understanding and possible development of interventions to alleviate these deficits in children and adolescents with HFASD.

Despite altered definition, executive functioning, expressed as higher cognitive skills required complex behaviors linked to the prefrontal cortex, are defective in autism. Specific difficulties in children presenting autism or verbal disabilities at executive functioning levels have been identified. Nevertheless, the developmental deficit of executive functioning in autism is highly diversified with huge individual variation and may even be absent.

Besides, according to recent studies, the quality of life of adolescents with ASD without mental retardation seems to be lower than adolescents with typical development. We guess that anxiety disorders may be responsible for a low quality of life in adolescents with ASD.

Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia. c.dissanayake@latrobe.edu.au.	Change over time in the age and number of children registered for autism-specific funding was examined, prior to and following introduction of the revised diagnostic criteria (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-fifth edition; DSM-5). De-identified data for 32,199 children aged under 7 years between 2010 and 2015 was utilised. Fluctuations were evident in the frequency and age of diagnoses, with slight increases in age of diagnosis corresponding with increases in frequency of diagnoses. The incidence of autism increased from 2010 to 2013, and then plateaued to 2015. A significant trend-relative reduction in the number of children registered to receive autism-specific funding was evident post 2013, suggesting the more stringent DSM-5 criteria may have curbed the trend of increasing diagnoses over time.

Compulsive movements, complex tics and stereotypies are frequent, especially among patients with autism or psychomotor retardation. These movements can be difficult to characterize and can mimic other conditions like epileptic seizures or paroxysmal dystonia, particularly when abnormal breathing and cerebral hypoxia are induced.

Community-based studies have consistently shown a sex ratio heavily skewed towards males in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The factors underlying this predominance of males are largely unknown, but the way girls score on standardized categorical diagnostic tools might account for the underrecognition of ASD in girls. Despite the existence of different norms for boys and girls with ASD on several major screening tests, the algorithm of the Autism Diagnosis Interview-Revised (ADI-R) has not been reformulated. The aim of our study was to investigate which ADI-R items discriminate between males and females, and to evaluate their weighting in the final diagnosis of autism. We then conducted discriminant analysis (DA) on a sample of 594 probands including 129 females with ASD, recruited by the Paris Autism Research International Sibpair (PARIS) Study. A replication analysis was run on an independent sample of 1716 probands including 338 females with ASD, recruited through the Autism Genetics Resource Exchange (AGRE) program. Entering the raw scores for all ADI-R items as independent variables, the DA correctly classified 78.9% of males and 72.9% of females (P < 0.001) in the PARIS cohort, and 72.2% of males and 68.3% of females (P < 0.0001) in the AGRE cohort. Among the items extracted by the stepwise DA, four belonged to the ADI-R algorithm used for the final diagnosis of ASD. In conclusion, several items of the ADI-R that are taken into account in the diagnosis of autism significantly differentiates between males and females. The potential gender bias thus induced may participate in the underestimation of the prevalence of ASD in females.

27788627		A qualitative study of attachment relationships in ASD during middle childhood.	Attachment & human development	2017	Belinda M Keenan, Louise K Newman, Kylie M Gray, Nicole J Rinehart	b Centre for Women's Mental Health , The Royal Women's Hospital and University of Melbourne , Melbourne , Australia. a Centre for Developmental Psychiatry and Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, School of Clinical Sciences , Monash University , Notting Hill , Australia. c Deakin Child Study Centre, School of Psychology , Deakin University , Geelong , Australia.	Although research has indicated that children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) display normative attachment behaviours, to date there has been limited qualitative research exploring these relationships. This study aimed to describe qualitative features of the child-caregiver attachment relationship in children with ASD. Primary caregivers to 26 children with ASD (aged 7-14 years) and 23 typically developing children (aged 7-13 years) were administered the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (Smyke & Zeanah, 1999) to elicit descriptions of children's attachment behaviours. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts indicated that while children with ASD demonstrated a range of normative attachment behaviours, they displayed impairments in the use of the caregiver as a secure base and co-regulating agent. ASD-associated impairments in emotion processing, sharing/reciprocity, and emotion co-regulation, as well as the caregiver's experience, were important in understanding attachment relationships in ASD. Findings highlight the need to consider the bidirectional nature of the attachment relationship in ASD.
27369067		Temporal voice areas exist in autism spectrum disorder but are dysfunctional for voice identity recognition.	Social cognitive and affective neuroscience	2016	Stefanie Schelinski, Kamila Borowiak, Katharina von Kriegstein	Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Max Planck Research Group, Neural mechanisms of human communication, Leipzig, 04103, Germany schelinski@cbs.mpg.de. Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Max Planck Research Group, Neural mechanisms of human communication, Leipzig, 04103, Germany.	The ability to recognise the identity of others is a key requirement for successful communication. Brain regions that respond selectively to voices exist in humans from early infancy on. Currently, it is unclear whether dysfunction of these voice-sensitive regions can explain voice identity recognition impairments. Here, we used two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging studies to investigate voice processing in a population that has been reported to have no voice-sensitive regions: autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our results refute the earlier report that individuals with ASD have no responses in voice-sensitive regions: Passive listening to vocal, compared to non-vocal, sounds elicited typical responses in voice-sensitive regions in the high-functioning ASD group and controls. In contrast, the ASD group had a dysfunction in voice-sensitive regions during voice identity but not speech recognition in the right posterior superior temporal sulcus/gyrus (STS/STG)-a region implicated in processing complex spectrotemporal voice features and unfamiliar voices. The right anterior STS/STG correlated with voice identity recognition performance in controls but not in the ASD group. The findings suggest that right STS/STG dysfunction is critical for explaining voice recognition impairments in high-functioning ASD and show that ASD is not characterised by a general lack of voice-sensitive responses.

Electronic address: P.E.Langdon@kent.ac.uk. Department of Clinical Psychology, Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK.	The aims of this study were to undertake a meta-analytic and systematic appraisal of the literature investigating the effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) when used with individuals who have autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs) for either a) affective disorders, or b) the symptoms of ASDs. Following a systematic search, 48 studies were included. CBT, used for affective disorders, was associated with a non-significant small to medium effect size, g=0.24, for self-report measures, a significant medium effect size, g=0.66, for informant-report measures, and a significant medium effect size, g=0.73, for clinician-report measures. CBT, used as a treatment for symptoms of ASDs, was associated with a small to medium non-significant effect size, g=0.25, for self-report measures, a significant small to medium effect size, g=0.48, for informant-report measures, a significant medium effect size, g=0.65, for clinician-report measures, and a significant small to medium effect size, g=0.35, for task-based measures. Sensitivity analyses reduced effect size magnitude, with the exception of that based on informant-report measures for the symptoms of ASDs, which increased, g=0.52. Definitive trials are needed to demonstrate that CBT is an empirically validated treatment for use with people who have ASDs.

"The study examines whether ""optimal outcome"" (OO) children, despite no longer meeting diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), exhibit personality traits often found in those with ASD. Nine zero acquaintance raters evaluated Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP) and Big Five personality traits of 22 OO individuals, 27 high functioning individuals with ASD (HFA), and 23 typically developing (TD) peers. HFA children displayed higher ratings than their peers on all BAP traits. OO were indistinguishable from TD, with the exception of greater extraversion (e.g., increased talkativeness), a potential tendency to be less emotionally stable, and pragmatic language deficits such as getting sidetracked in conversation. Overall, OO individuals are not showing BAP characteristics, but may be subject to other mild ADHD-like characteristics."

Virenze RIAGG Maastricht (Child and Youth Care) and Department of Clinical Psychological Science, Maastricht University, Postbox 616, 6200 MD, Maastricht, The Netherlands. Department of Clinical Psychology, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.	A social skills training (SST) for high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was evaluated in an outpatient setting using a combined between- and within-subject design in which SST and a waiting list condition were compared. According to parents and teachers, the SST produced greater improvement of social skills than the waiting list, and these effects were maintained at 3 months follow-up. No between-group effects were found for loneliness, although in general scores on this outcome measure decreased from pre- to follow-up. The effects of SST were unaffected by social anxiety, ADHD symptoms, Theory of Mind, or desire for social interaction. Altogether, SST seems an effective intervention for high-functioning children with ASD that can be applied in daily clinical practice.

The pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is not completely understood, but there is evidence of associations with altered immune responses. The aim of this study was to determine the serum levels of various cytokines in children with ASD and in healthy controls, in order to determine their role in ASD and its diagnostic subgroups. Sixty-five ASD patients were enrolled from an epidemiological survey in Norway, of which 30 were diagnosed with childhood autism, 16 with Asperger syndrome, 12 with atypical autism, 1 with Rett syndrome, and 6 with another ASD diagnosis. The serum levels of 12 cytokines were measured in all of the patients and in 30 healthy children. The cytokine levels did not differ significantly between the ASD group and the healthy controls. However, the interleukin-8 (IL-8) level was significantly higher (6.82 vs 4.58 pg/ml, p = 0.017) while that of IL-10 was significantly lower (2.24 vs 6.49 pg/ml, p = 0.009) in patients with childhood autism than in controls. Furthermore, the IL-8 level was significantly higher in childhood autism than in Asperger syndrome (6.82 vs 4.05 pg/ml, p = 0.013). Our study shows that the cytokine profile of children diagnosed with ASD, regardless of the subdiagnosis, does not differ from healthy controls. However, differentiation into different diagnostic subgroups reveals significantly different levels of IL-8 and IL-10. This indicates that different mechanisms may underlie the different ASD subdiagnoses. Future research into the pathophysiological mechanisms of ASD should pay more attention to the different subdiagnoses of ASD.

This study examined differences between adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; N = 40) and typical community volunteers (N = 25) on measures of stressful life events, perceived stress, and biological stress response (cardiovascular and cortisol reactivity) during a novel social stress task. Additional analyses examined the relationship between stress and social functioning as measured by the Social Adjustment Scale-II and the Waisman Activities of Daily Living scale. Results indicated that adults with ASD experienced significantly more stressful life events and perceived stress, and greater systolic blood pressure reactivity than typical community volunteers. Results also indicated that perceived stress and stressful life events were significantly associated with social disability. Interventions targeting stress management might improve social function in adults with ASD.

DeGroote School of Medicine,Faculty of Health Sciences,McMaster University,Hamilton,Ontario,Canada. Department of Psychiatry/Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute,Consultation-Liaison Service,University of California San Francisco Medical Center,San Francisco,California,USA.	"From 1943, when Leo Kanner originally described autism, and to the first objective criteria for ""infantile autism"" in DSM-III and the inclusion of Asperger's disorder in DSM-IV, the subsequent classification scheme for autistic disorders has led to a substantial change with the 2013 issuance of the DSM-5 by including subcategories into one umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Baker, 2013). ASD is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder, characterized by social and communication impairments and restricted, stereotypical patterns of behavior (Baker, 2013). It is currently expected that most, or all of the actual cases of ASD, are identified in a timely way (i.e. in early childhood). However, there are many undiagnosed older adults who may have met the current diagnostic criteria for ASD as children, but never received such a diagnosis due to the fact it had yet to be established. In addition, some patients with relatively less impairing phenotypes may escape formal diagnosis in childhood, only to later be diagnosed in adulthood. Nevertheless, the first generation of diagnosed patients with ASD is now in old age. Many such ASD patients have needed family and institutional support for their lives subsequent to childhood diagnosis. Due to aging and death of their parents and other supportive figures leading to a loss of social structures, there is no better time than now for the medical community to act."

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	John E Robison	The College of William & Mary in Virginia, USA.	"Scholars have long speculated about how Kanner and Asperger's descriptions of autistic behavior appeared just 1 year apart in America and Austria even as World War II had severed communication between the two countries. Both conspiracy and serendipity have been alleged, but a simpler explanation has now emerged. Autistic knowledge crossed the Atlantic with Georg Frankl-a previously unrecognized ""man in the middle"" who followed his fiancé to America. The evidence presented here fills in many blanks and suggests both Kanner and Asperger benefited from Frankl's insight. He was a guiding force for both men: unseen until now because he left very little in the way of published papers. To the end of their lives, Kanner and Asperger described their conditions as separate and distinct. Today, they are both part of the Autism Spectrum in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.). This article explains how and why Kanner and Asperger saw their descriptions as different. It makes the case that Georg Frankl helped both men see autism as we know it today and first saw the breadth of that continuum."

29924527		The Hyper-Modular Associative Mind: A Computational Analysis of Associative Responses of Persons with Asperger Syndrome.	Language and speech	2016	Yoed N Kenett, Rinat Gold, Miriam Faust		Rigidity of thought is considered a main characteristic of persons with Asperger syndrome (AS). This rigidity may explain the poor comprehension of unusual semantic relations, frequently exhibited by persons with AS. Research indicates that such deficiency is related to altered mental lexicon organization, but has never been directly examined. The present study used computational network science tools to compare the mental lexicon structure of persons with AS and matched controls. Persons with AS and matched controls generated free associations, and network tools were used to extract and compare the mental lexicon structure of the two groups. The analysis revealed that persons with AS exhibit a hyper-modular semantic organization: their mental lexicon is more compartmentalized compared to matched controls. We argue that this hyper-modularity may be related to the rigidity of thought which characterizes persons with AS and discuss the clinical and more general cognitive implications of our findings.

Frontiers in psychiatry	2016	John P Welsh, Jeffrey T Oristaglio	Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Drexel University College of Medicine , Philadelphia, PA , USA. Center for Integrative Brain Research, Seattle Children's Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA; Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington Autism Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.	Changes in the timing performance of conditioned responses (CRs) acquired during trace and delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC) are presented for diagnostic subgroups of children having autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 6-15 years. Children diagnosed with autistic disorder (AD) were analyzed separately from children diagnosed with either Asperger's syndrome or Pervasive developmental disorder (Asp/PDD) not otherwise specified and compared to an age- and IQ-matched group of children who were typically developing (TD). Within-subject and between-groups contrasts in CR performance on sequential exposure to trace and delay EBC were analyzed to determine whether any differences would expose underlying functional heterogeneities of the cerebral and cerebellar systems, in ASD subgroups. The EBC parameters measured were percentage CRs, CR onset latency, and CR peak latency. Neither AD nor Asp/PDD groups were impaired in CR acquisition during trace or delay EBC. Both AD and Asp/PDD altered CR timing, but not always in the same way. Although the AD group showed normal CR timing during trace EBC, the Asp/PDD group showed a significant 27 and 28 ms increase in CR onset and peak latency, respectively, during trace EBC. In contrast, the direction of the timing change was opposite during delay EBC, during which the Asp/PDD group showed a significant 29 ms decrease in CR onset latency and the AD group showed a larger 77 ms decrease in CR onset latency. Only the AD group showed a decrease in CR peak latency during delay EBC, demonstrating another difference between AD and Asp/PDD. The difference in CR onset latency during delay EBC for both AD and Asp/PDD was due to an abnormal prevalence of early onset CRs that were intermixed with CRs having normal timing, as observed both in CR onset histograms and mean CR waveforms. In conclusion, significant heterogeneity in EBC performance was apparent between diagnostic groups, and this may indicate that EBC performance can report the heterogeneity in the neurobiological predispositions for ASD. The findings will inform further explorations with larger cohorts, different sensory modalities, and different EBC paradigms and provide a reference set for future EBC studies of children having ASD and non-human models.

A growing number of publications indicates presence of significant deficits in social cognition in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). These deficits appear to be comparable in qualitative and quantitative dimension with impairment of the same functions among people with Asperger syndrome (AS). The aim of this study is to identify subject areas in the field of impairment of social cognition processes among people with Asperger syndrome and anorexia nervosa taking into consideration the potential contribution of genetic pathways of oxytocin and vasopressin in the pathogenesis of these diseases. In the first part of the paper a systematic analysis of studies aimed at the evaluation of the processes of social cognition among patients with AN and AS has been carried out. The results of a significant number of studies confirm the presence of deficits in social cognition in AN and AS. In addition, among patients with AN and AS there exists a similar structure and distribution of the brain functions in regions responsible for social cognition. The second part of the paper describes the role of the oxytocin-vasopressin system (OT-AVP) in the processes of social cognition in AN and AS. Its genetic basis and the possible importance of single nucleotide polymorphisms within the genes: OXT, AVP, CD38, OXTR, AVPR1A and LNPEP have also been presented.

Social cognitive and affective neuroscience	2017	Gabriela Rosenblau, Dorit Kliemann, Isabel Dziobek, Hauke R Heekeren	Cluster of Excellence 'Languages of Emotion', Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin 14195, Germany.	Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by severe deficits in social communication, whereby the nature of their impairments in emotional prosody processing have yet to be specified. Here, we investigated emotional prosody processing in individuals with ASD and controls with novel, lifelike behavioral and neuroimaging paradigms. Compared to controls, individuals with ASD showed reduced emotional prosody recognition accuracy on a behavioral task. On the neural level, individuals with ASD displayed reduced activity of the STS, insula and amygdala for complex vs basic emotions compared to controls. Moreover, the coupling between the STS and amygdala for complex vs basic emotions was reduced in the ASD group. Finally, groups differed with respect to the relationship between brain activity and behavioral performance. Brain activity during emotional prosody processing was more strongly related to prosody recognition accuracy in ASD participants. In contrast, the coupling between STS and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) activity predicted behavioral task performance more strongly in the control group. These results provide evidence for aberrant emotional prosody processing of individuals with ASD. They suggest that the differences in the relationship between the neural and behavioral level of individuals with ASD may account for their observed deficits in social communication.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2017	Riccardo Fusaroli, Anna Lambrechts, Dan Bang, Dermot M Bowler, Sebastian B Gaigg	The Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. Autism Research Group, City University London, London, UK.	Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to show distinctive, atypical acoustic patterns of speech. These behaviors affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically reviewed the literature quantifying acoustic patterns in ASD. Search terms were: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality OR acoustic) AND (autis* OR Asperger). Results were filtered to include only: empirical studies quantifying acoustic features of vocal production in ASD, with a sample size >2, and the inclusion of a neurotypical comparison group and/or correlations between acoustic measures and severity of clinical features. We identified 34 articles, including 30 univariate studies and 15 multivariate machine-learning studies. We performed meta-analyses of the univariate studies, identifying significant differences in mean pitch and pitch range between individuals with ASD and comparison participants (Cohen's d of 0.4-0.5 and discriminatory accuracy of about 61-64%). The multivariate studies reported higher accuracies than the univariate studies (63-96%). However, the methods used and the acoustic features investigated were too diverse for performing meta-analysis. We conclude that multivariate studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but yet unsystematic avenue for establishing ASD markers. We outline three recommendations for future studies: open data, open methods, and theory-driven research.

State Research Institute of Physiology and Basic Medicine; Novosibirsk State University. Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica; Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences. Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica.	Several neuroimaging studies have suggested that the low spatial frequency content in an emotional face mainly activates the amygdala, pulvinar, and superior colliculus especially with fearful faces(1-3). These regions constitute the limbic structure in non-conscious perception of emotions and modulate cortical activity either directly or indirectly(2). In contrast, the conscious representation of emotions is more pronounced in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal cortex, and somatosensory cortex for directing voluntary attention to details in faces(3,4). Asperger's syndrome (AS)(5,6) represents an atypical mental disturbance that affects sensory, affective and communicative abilities, without interfering with normal linguistic skills and intellectual ability. Several studies have found that functional deficits in the neural circuitry important for facial emotion recognition can partly explain social communication failure in patients with AS(7-9). In order to clarify the interplay between conscious and non-conscious representations of emotional faces in AS, an EEG experimental protocol is designed with two tasks involving emotionality evaluation of either photograph or line-drawing faces. A pilot study is introduced for selecting face stimuli that minimize the differences in reaction times and scores assigned to facial emotions between the pretested patients with AS and IQ/gender-matched healthy controls. Information from the pretested patients was used to develop the scoring system used for the emotionality evaluation. Research into facial emotions and visual stimuli with different spatial frequency contents has reached discrepant findings depending on the demographic characteristics of participants and task demands(2). The experimental protocol is intended to clarify deficits in patients with AS in processing emotional faces when compared with healthy controls by controlling for factors unrelated to recognition of facial emotions, such as task difficulty, IQ and gender.

PloS one	2016	Simon Baron-Cohen, Emma Robson, Meng-Chuan Lai, Carrie Allison	Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.	Research has linked Mirror-Touch (MT) synaesthesia with enhanced empathy. We test the largest sample of MT synaesthetes to date to examine two claims that have been previously made: that MT synaesthetes (1) have superior empathy; and (2) only ever experience their MT synaesthesia in response to viewing a person being touched. Given that autism has been suggested to involve deficits in cognitive empathy, we also test two predictions: that MT synaesthetes should (3) be less likely than general population individuals without MT synaesthesia to have an autism spectrum condition (ASC), if MT is characterized by superior empathy; and (4) have fewer autistic traits. We selected three groups: a pure MT synaesthesia group (N = 46), a pure grapheme-colour (GC) synaesthesia group (N = 36), and a typical control group without synaesthesia (N = 46). Participants took three measures of empathy and one measure of autistic traits. MT synaesthetes did not show enhanced empathy. In addition, 30% of all MT synaesthetes recruited into this study (N = 135) reported also having ASC, and MT synaesthetes showed higher autistic trait scores than controls. Finally, some MT experiences were reported in response to viewing objects being touched. Our findings dispute the views that MT synaesthesia is linked with enhanced empathy, is less likely to occur with ASC or elevated autistic traits, and is specific to seeing a person being touched.

Gillberg Neuropsychiatry Centre, University of Gothenburg, Kungsgatan 12, 411 19, Gothenburg, Sweden.	The literature concerning sexuality in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is limited regarding inappropriate sexual behaviours and paraphilias and its relation to age, verbal ability, symptom severity, intellectual ability, or adaptive functioning. A cohort of 184 adolescents and young adults (ages 15-39 years) with ASD diagnosed in childhood, including both low and high functioning individuals, was examined. The large majority were found to have a sexual interest and showed interest towards the opposite sex. Inappropriate sexual behaviours and paraphilias were reported for about a fourth of the individuals. No relationships were found between inappropriate sexual behaviours and any of the background variables listed above. However, associations were found between paraphilias and ASD symptom severity, intellectual ability, and adaptive functioning.

Adicciones	2016	Emilia Marchei, Ilaria Palmi, Simona Pichini, Roberta Pacifici, Ileana-Rita Anton Airaldi, Juan Antonio Costa Orvay, Joan García Serra, Bartolomé Bonet Serra, Óscar García-Algar		This study presents the case of a 4-year-old healthy child admitted to the paediatric ward for suspected accidental intoxication due to ingestion of narcoleptic drugs (methylphenidate, sertraline and quetiapine), taken on a regular basis by his 8-year-old brother affected by Asperger syndrome.Intoxication can be objectively assessed by measurements of drugs and metabolites in biological matrices with short-term (blood and urine) or long-term (hair) detection windows. At the hospital, the child's blood and urine were analysed by immunoassay (confirmed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry), and sertraline and quetiapine and their metabolites were identified. The suspicion that the mother administered drugs chronically prompted the analysis of six, consecutive 2-cm segments of the child's hair, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, thereby accounting for ingestion over the previous 12 months. Quetiapine was found in the first four segments with a mean concentration of 1.00 ng/mg ± 0.94 ng/mg hair while sertraline and its metabolite, desmethyl-sertraline, were found in all segments with a mean concentration of 2.65 ± 0.94 ng/mg and 1.50 ± 0.94 ng/mg hair, respectively. Hair analyses were negative for methylphenidate and its metabolite (ritalinic acid). Biological matrices testing for psychoactive drugs disclosed both acute and chronic intoxication with quetiapine and sertraline administered by the mother.

Frontiers in psychiatry	2016	Helene Haker, Maya Schneebeli, Klaas Enno Stephan	Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich , Zurich , Switzerland. Translational Neuromodeling Unit (TNU), Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, University College London, London, UK; Max Planck Institute for Metabolism Research, Cologne, Germany.	"Diagnosis and individualized treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) represent major problems for contemporary psychiatry. Tackling these problems requires guidance by a pathophysiological theory. In this paper, we consider recent theories that re-conceptualize ASD from a ""Bayesian brain"" perspective, which posit that the core abnormality of ASD resides in perceptual aberrations due to a disbalance in the precision of prediction errors (sensory noise) relative to the precision of predictions (prior beliefs). This results in percepts that are dominated by sensory inputs and less guided by top-down regularization and shifts the perceptual focus to detailed aspects of the environment with difficulties in extracting meaning. While these Bayesian theories have inspired ongoing empirical studies, their clinical implications have not yet been carved out. Here, we consider how this Bayesian perspective on disease mechanisms in ASD might contribute to improving clinical care for affected individuals. Specifically, we describe a computational strategy, based on generative (e.g., hierarchical Bayesian) models of behavioral and functional neuroimaging data, for establishing diagnostic tests. These tests could provide estimates of specific cognitive processes underlying ASD and delineate pathophysiological mechanisms with concrete treatment targets. Written with a clinical audience in mind, this article outlines how the development of computational diagnostics applicable to behavioral and functional neuroimaging data in routine clinical practice could not only fundamentally alter our concept of ASD but eventually also transform the clinical management of this disorder."
27374252	doi: 10.1111/1745-8315.12544	The capacity to tell a joke: Reflections from work with Asperger children.	The International journal of psycho-analysis	2016	Lawrence J Brown	37 Homer Street, Newton Centre, MA, USA.	The capacity to tell a joke is a highly complex interpersonal event that depends upon the maturation of certain developmental achievements which are absent or stunted in children with Asperger's Syndrome. These include the ability to know another's mind, a sense of interpersonal timing and, most notably, a capacity for abstract thinking. The author discusses Freud's () notion of joke-work, which is akin to dream-work, both of which are pathways to forming mental representations. Freud considered joke-work as a mental activity that operated on the verbal level and the author examines the preverbal dimensions that are rooted in the earliest mother/infant interactions. An extended case discussion of the psychoanalytic treatment of an Asperger boy is offered to illustrate these points and to demonstrate the activity of joke-work as a means of building mental representations.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	Theodore S Tomeny	The University of Alabama, USA.	The link between autism spectrum disorder symptoms and maternal stress has been well established, yet many mothers remain resilient to more severe psychopathology. For the current online study, 111 mothers of a child with autism spectrum disorder completed questionnaires about their child's symptoms, their own stress related to parenting, and any psychopathology symptoms they were experiencing. Autism spectrum disorder symptom severity was positively related to both parenting stress and maternal psychopathology symptoms. Furthermore, parenting stress mediated the relation between autism spectrum disorder symptom severity and maternal psychopathology symptoms. These results provide evidence for a pathway through which psychopathology may develop among mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder and a potential point of intervention for clinicians serving this population.

Acta chimica Slovenica	2016	Ivana Tomaz, Luna Maslov, Domagoj Stupić, Darko Preiner, Danijela Ašperger, Jasminka Karoglan Kontić		For the characterization of grape cultivars, the profile and content of flavonoids are important because these compounds have an impact on grape and wine quality. A new extraction method for the recovery of flavonoids, e.g. anthocyanins, flavonols and flavan-3-ols from grape skins was developed. The optimization of solid-liquid extraction of flavonoids was conducted, with respect to the type of the organic solvent and its percentage in the extraction solvent as well as the extraction temperature and extraction time, using response surface methodology. Optimal conditions were obtained by using extraction solvent composed from acetonitrile:water:formic acid (20:79:1; v/v/v), at an extraction temperature of 50 °C, an extraction time of 1 h in a single-step extraction and with a solid-to-solvent ratio of 1:80 g mL(-1) (125 mg of grape skin powder and 10 mL of extraction solvent). The new optimal extraction method is inexpensive, simple, fast, accurate and selective for the recovery of simple flavonoids.

[Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health	2016	Hiroko Honda, Emiko Saito		Purpose To clarify the care burden and associated factors among parents of adults with developmental disabilities in order to obtain suggestions for the family supports.Methods Subjects included 125 parents of adults (aged 18 or older) with developmental disabilities. All parents belonged to and/or contacted parents' associations, mental health welfare centers, and support centers for persons with developmental disabilities in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Participants completed self-report questionnaire surveys from October to November 2011. Questionnaire items included parent and adult demographic factors, parent care burden, disability state, and support available from family and others. The level of care burden was measured using the short Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview (J-ZBI_8).Results A total of 64 responses were analyzed. The mean J-ZBI_8 score was 12.8 (SD=7.2). Adults' most common diagnoses were autism (50%), Asperger's syndrome (25%), and pervasive developmental disorder (20%). state of daily life (P=0.041) and presence of secondary disability (P=0.001) were associated with parents' care burden in age-adjusted multiple linear regression analysis.Discussion Overall, the results suggest that it is important to assess developmental disability status and family support when developing programs to reduce parental care burden.

There has been limited study of the relationship between child attachment and caregiver wellbeing amongst children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined self-reported child attachment quality alongside caregivers' report of their own psychological distress, parenting stress and attachment style, amongst 24 children with high-functioning autism or Asperger's disorder (ASD; aged 7-14 years) and 24 typically developing children (aged 7-12 years), and their primary caregiver. Children with ASD were no less secure, but their caregivers were more stressed and reported more attachment-related anxiety, compared to typically developing dyads. Child attachment security was related to caregiver psychological distress and attachment style, but only amongst typically developing children. Impacts of emotion processing impairments on caregiver-child relationships in ASD are discussed.

Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology and Special Education, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.	The application of virtual reality technologies (VRTs) for users with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been studied for decades. However, a gap remains in our understanding surrounding VRT head-mounted displays (HMDs). As newly designed HMDs have become commercially available (in this study the Oculus Rift™) the need to investigate newer devices is immediate. This study explored willingness, acceptance, sense of presence and immersion of ASD participants. Results revealed that all 29 participants (mean age = 32; 33 % with IQ < 70) were willing to wear the HMD. The majority of the participants reported an enjoyable experience, high levels of 'presence', and were likely to use HMDs again. IQ was found to be independent of the willingness to use HMDs and related VRT immersion experience.

Department of Health Systems Management, Yezreel Valley College, Emek Yezreel, 19300, Israel. fridas@yvc.ac.il.	The prevalence of autism has increased dramatically. The objectives of this study were to explore attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis to detect autism prenatally and avoid having an affected child and to understand social acceptability of these disorders among students of allied health professions. In this study, college students of nursing and health systems management answered a structured self-report questionnaire (n = 305). The first part addressed the respondent's personal data. The second part targeted the respondent's attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis of non-life-threatening disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. We found that almost two thirds of the students responded that they would not proceed with a pregnancy if the child were diagnosed with autism, and more than half thought that they would not continue with a pregnancy if the fetus were diagnosed with Asperger's. Age, level of religiosity, and years of education were influential. This study is limited in scope; however, the positive attitude of the students toward prenatal diagnosis to avoid having an affected child might also reflect a negative view of autism spectrum disorders in future health care professionals. Further research of attitudes and the social acceptability of autism spectrum disorders, particularly among health care professionals, is required.

Atypical language is a fundamental feature of autism spectrum conditions (ASC), but few studies have examined the structural integrity of the arcuate fasciculus, the major white matter tract connecting frontal and temporal language regions, which is usually implicated as the main transfer route used in processing linguistic information by the brain. Abnormalities in the arcuate have been reported in young children with ASC, mostly in low-functioning or non-verbal individuals, but little is known regarding the structural properties of the arcuate in adults with ASC or, in particular, in individuals with ASC who have intact language, such as those with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. We used probabilistic tractography of diffusion-weighted imaging to isolate and scrutinize the arcuate in a mixed-gender sample of 18 high-functioning adults with ASC (17 Asperger syndrome) and 14 age- and IQ-matched typically developing controls. Arcuate volume was significantly reduced bilaterally with clearest differences in the right hemisphere. This finding remained significant in an analysis of all male participants alone. Volumetric reduction in the arcuate was significantly correlated with the severity of autistic symptoms as measured by the Autism-Spectrum Quotient. These data reveal that structural differences are present even in high-functioning adults with ASC, who presented with no clinically manifest language deficits and had no reported developmental language delay. Arcuate structural integrity may be useful as an index of ASC severity and thus as a predictor and biomarker for ASC. Implications for future research are discussed.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	Adam Helles, I Carina Gillberg, Christopher Gillberg, Eva Billstedt	1 University of Gothenburg, Sweden.	This study examined objective quality of life (work, academic success, living situation, relationships, support system) and subjective quality of life (Sense of Coherence and Short-Form Health Survey-36) in an adult sample of males ( n = 50, mean age: 30 years) with Asperger syndrome diagnosed in childhood and followed prospectively over two decades. The association between long-term diagnostic stability of an autism spectrum disorder and/or comorbid psychiatric disorders with quality of life was also examined. The results showed great variability as regards quality of life. The subsample that no longer fulfilled an autism spectrum disorder had full-time jobs or studies (10/11), independent living (100%), and reported having two or more friends (100%). In the stable autism spectrum disorder group, 41% had full-time job or studies, 51% lived independently, and 33% reported two or more friends, and a significant minority had specialized employments, lived with support from the government, or had no friends. Academic success was positively correlated with IQ. A majority of the total group scored average Sense of Coherence scores, and the mean for Short-Form Health Survey-36 was above average regarding psychical health and below average regarding mental health. Stability of autism spectrum disorder diagnosis was associated with objective but not subjective quality of life, while psychiatric comorbidity was associated with subjective but not objective quality of life.
27198123	doi: 10.1111/gbb.12298	Programming social behavior by the maternal fragile X protein.	Genes, brain, and behavior	2016	B Zupan, A Sharma, A Frazier, S Klein, M Toth	Department of Psychology, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA. Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, USA.	The developing fetus and neonate are highly sensitive to maternal environment. Besides the well-documented effects of maternal stress, nutrition and infections, maternal mutations, by altering the fetal, perinatal and/or early postnatal environment, can impact the behavior of genetically normal offspring. Mutation/premutation in the X-linked FMR1 (encoding the translational regulator FMRP) in females, although primarily responsible for causing fragile X syndrome (FXS) in their children, may also elicit such maternal effects. We showed that a deficit in maternal FMRP in mice results in hyperactivity in the genetically normal offspring. To test if maternal FMRP has a broader intergenerational effect, we measured social behavior, a core dimension of neurodevelopmental disorders, in offspring of FMRP-deficient dams. We found that male offspring of Fmr1(+/-) mothers, independent of their own Fmr1 genotype, exhibit increased approach and reduced avoidance toward conspecific strangers, reminiscent of 'indiscriminate friendliness' or the lack of stranger anxiety, diagnosed in neglected children and in patients with Asperger's and Williams syndrome. Furthermore, social interaction failed to activate mesolimbic/amygdala regions, encoding social aversion, in these mice, providing a neurobiological basis for the behavioral abnormality. This work identifies a novel role for FMRP that extends its function beyond the well-established genetic function into intergenerational non-genetic inheritance/programming of social behavior and the corresponding neuronal circuit. As FXS premutation and some psychiatric conditions that can be associated with reduced FMRP expression are more prevalent in mothers than full FMR1 mutation, our findings potentially broaden the significance of FMRP-dependent programming of social behavior beyond the FXS population.
27197697	doi: 10.1177/1362361316645429	Personality traits, autobiographical memory and knowledge of self and others: A comparative study in young people with autism spectrum disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	Sally Robinson, Patricia Howlin, Ailsa Russell	3 University of Bath, UK. 1 Evelina London Children's Hospital, UK. 2 King's College London, UK.	The relationship between dissociable components of autobiographical memory (e.g. semantic personality traits and episodic memory retrieval) and other cognitive skills that are proposed to enable one to develop a sense of self (e.g. introspection) have not previously been explored for children with autism spectrum disorder. This study compared autobiographical memory (semantic and episodic) and knowledge of self (internal/external self-knowledge and introspection/mentalising abilities) in children (aged 11-18 years) with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder and typically developing controls (total N = 48). Novel and standard tasks were employed. Compared to typically developing controls, young people with autism spectrum disorder had autobiographical memory difficulties that were characterised by a reduction in the retrieval of semantic personality traits, with more initial prompts required to facilitate episodic memory retrieval and fewer episodic memories containing emotional and sensory information. Knowledge of the self and others was also impaired, with reduced introspection and poorer mentalising abilities. Young people with autism spectrum disorder were also identified as presenting with an atypical relationship between autobiographical memory and self-knowledge, which was significantly different from typically developing controls. Test performance is discussed in relation to the functions of autobiographical memory, with consideration of how these cognitive difficulties may contribute to clinical practices and the social and behavioural characteristics of autism spectrum disorder.

A small body of literature has suggested that, rather than being more likely to engage in offending or violent behavior, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may actually have an increased risk of being the victim rather than the perpetrator of violence (Sobsey, Wells, Lucardie, & Mansell, 1995 ). There is no evidence that people with ASD are more violent than those without ASD (Im, 2016). There is nevertheless a small subgroup of individuals with ASD who exhibit violent offending behaviours and our previous work has suggested that other factors, such as adverse childhood experiences, might be important in this subgroup (Allely, Minnis, Thompson, Wilson, & Gillberg, 2014 ). Fitzgerald ( 2015 ) highlights that school shootings and mass killings are not uncommonly carried out by individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, with frequent evidence of warning indicators. The aim of the present review is to investigate this in more detail using the 73 mass shooting events identified by Mother Jones (motherjones.com) in their database for potential ASD features. There are 73 mass shooting events but there are two events where there is a pair of shooters which meant that 75 mass shooter cases were investigated. This exercise tentatively suggests evidence of ASD in six of 75 included cases (8%) which is about eight times higher when compared to the prevalence of ASD found in the general population worldwide (motherjones.com). The 8% figure for individuals with ASD involved mass killings is a conservative estimate. In addition to the six cases which provide the 8% figure, there were 16 other cases with some indication of ASD. Crucially, ASD may influence, but does not cause, an individual to commit extreme violent acts such as a mass shooting episode.

Journal of child sexual abuse	2016	Katrin Lainpelto, Johan Isaksson, Frank Lindblad	b Department of Neuroscience, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit , Uppsala University , Uppsala , Sweden. a Department of Law , Stockholm University , Stockholm , Sweden.	"This study aimed at investigating if attitudes toward children with neuropsychiatric disorders influence evaluations concerning allegations of child sexual abuse. Law students (n = 107) at Stockholm University, Sweden, were presented a transcript of a mock police interview with a girl, 11 years of age. This interview was based on a real case, selected as a ""typical"" example from these years concerning contributions from the interviewer and the alleged victim. After having read the transcript, the students responded to a questionnaire concerning degree of credibility, if the girl talked about events that had really occurred, richness of details, and if the narrations were considered truthful and age-adequate. Fifty-four of the students were also told that the girl had been given the diagnoses of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Asperger syndrome. Students who were informed about the diagnoses gave significantly lower scores concerning credibility of the interviewee. To a lesser degree they regarded her narrations as expressions of what had really occurred and considered her statements less truthful. Furthermore, they found that the narrations contained fewer details. Finally, they found the girl less competent to tell about abuse. We conclude that a neuropsychiatric disorder may infer risks of unjustified skeptical attitudes concerning trustworthiness and cognitive capacity."

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	Yu-Wei Chen, Anita C Bundy, Reinie Cordier, Yi-Ling Chien, Stewart L Einfeld	3 National Taiwan University Hospital, Taiwan. 2 Curtin University, Australia. 1 The University of Sydney, Australia.	Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder commonly have limited social participation. This study aimed to examine the similarities and differences of everyday participation among males and females with autism spectrum disorder in Australia and Taiwan, using an experience sampling methodology. A total of 14 Australians (4 males, aged 16-43 years) and 16 Taiwanese (12 males, aged 19-45 years) with autism spectrum disorder who are cognitively able were asked to carry a device which prompted them seven times per day for 7 days, to record everyday participation: where they were, what they were doing, and who they were with. Multilevel analyses were used to identify the relationships between everyday participation and associated factors including gender, country of residence, clinical severity of autism spectrum disorder, and social anxiety. The results showed that Taiwanese participants were more likely to stay at home than Australian participants. However, female participants were more likely to engage in social situations than males. Furthermore, participants with fewer autism spectrum disorder symptoms and those with higher levels of social anxiety were less likely to engage in social interactions. This study sheds light on ways that culture and gender affect social participation and highlights the relationship of social anxiety to social participation. The findings have implications for interventions for social participation.

CNS & neurological disorders drug targets	2016	Rei Wake, Tsuyoshi Miyaoka, Motohide Furuya, Sadayuki Hashioka, Jun Horiguchi		A neuropsychiatric syndrome, Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is qualified via impairments in qualitative communication, social interaction, and stereotyped or restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. While all ASDs are considered to have qualitative deficits in social relatedness to others, many people with ASDs have other symptoms, including irritability (which includes aggression, self-injurious behavior, and severe tantrums). In order to decrease these behaviors, it is often helpful to make use of behavioral therapy. In addition, due to the intensity and severity of irritability, adjunctive medications are sometimes needed. Although many of the adjunctive medications have been tested and demonstrated to be useful in treating ASD, no clear standardized treatment has emerged. While the adjunctive medications have shown efficacy, the associated side effects have proven to be a barrier to their accepted use. A traditional Japanese medicine, Yokukansan (YKS), is composed of seven kinds of dried herbs and is widely clinically prescribed for treating psychiatric disorders by acting mainly on the glutamatergic and serotonergic nervous systems. YKS may be safe and useful in treating dementia patients' behavioral and psychological symptoms according to indications from recent studies. We introduce in this review, the ameliorative effects of YKS on Asperger's disorder in open-label studies and on ASDs including pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). This review will suggest that YKS is well tolerated and effective for the treatment for subjects with ASD who have severe hyperactivity/noncompliance and irritability/agitation. Additionally, the serotonergic, glutamatergic, anti-inflammatory and neurogenesis effects are explored which are thought to be involved in the mechanisms underlying the efficacy of YKS.

Introduction This study examined the potential feasibility of tele-delivered parent coaching in a rural area of Italy through a survey of parents' attitudes towards this type of intervention. Methods Parents of all children up to six years of age registered with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder at the clinic catering for the area were invited to take part in the study. The final sample consisted of 43 parents. Results Parents with worse Internet skills and those who reported lower levels of satisfaction with currently received services were less likely to be willing to enrol. There was a trend for parents with lower self-efficacy to be less likely to enrol. Educational level, previous experience of video-calling, travel time to the clinic and child's level of ability were not associated with the choice of enrolment. Discussion Implications for strategies to contrast barriers to adoption and strengthen implementation plans are discussed.

26951327		Adolescent boys with an autism spectrum disorder and their experience of sexuality: An interpretative phenomenological analysis.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2017	Jeroen Dewinter, Hanna Van Parys, Robert Vermeiren, Chijs van Nieuwenhuizen	GGzE Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, The Netherlands jeroen.dewinter@antwerpen.be. GGzE Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, The Netherlands. Ghent University, Belgium. Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.	This qualitative study explored how adolescent boys with autism spectrum disorder experience their sexuality. Previous research has demonstrated that sexuality is a developmental task for boys with autism spectrum disorder, as it is for their peers. Case studies have suggested a relation between autism spectrum disorder and atypical sexual development; empirical studies on this subject, however, are scant and inconsistent. This study is based on interviews with eight boys, aged 16-20 years, with Asperger's disorder or autistic disorder. Interpretative phenomenological analysis of the data revealed three major themes relating to (a) how they experience sexual feelings, think about sexuality and think about themselves as sexual beings; (b) how they perceive messages relating to sexuality in their surroundings; and (c) how they experience finding and having a partner and partnered sex. We believe that attention to these themes is needed in assessment, education and further research.

International journal of mental health nursing	2016	Laura Foran Lewis	College of Nursing and Health Sciences, University of Vermont, Burlington, Vermont, USA.	Many individuals with autism spectrum disorder are not diagnosed until adulthood, yet little is known about their experiences. This descriptive phenomenological study aimed to explore the experience of realizing a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in adulthood. A purposive sample of 77 adults was asked to describe their experiences of realizing a diagnosis as adults via an open-ended online survey. Data were analysed using Colaizzi's method and six themes were derived: feeling different from others, riding an emotional rollercoaster, striving to accept themselves, strategizing to improve their lives, maintaining normalcy, and wandering into the future. Nurses must realize the importance of screening for depression following a new diagnosis. Barriers to reaching a formal diagnosis should also be evaluated.

There has been an increasing interest in possible connections between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia in the last decade. Neuropsychological comparison studies have, however, been few. The present study examined similarities and differences in intellectual and executive functioning between adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and adults with schizophrenic psychosis (SP). A group with AS and a group with SP were assessed neuropsychologically with WAIS-III and D-KEFS. Similarities were found between groups, as displayed by an uneven cognitive profile, limitations in working memory, processing speed and some aspects of executive functioning. Full Scale IQ was higher in the AS group. These results add to the current research illuminating similarities and differences between ASD and schizophrenia on a cognitive level.

Increasing numbers of girls have been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and other autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) over the past two decades; therefore, more women with ASDs are entering the childbearing phase of their lives. Little is known about the childbearing experiences of women with ASDs. This qualitative study describes the childbearing experiences of eight women with Asperger syndrome. Four major themes emerged: Processing Sensations, Needing to Have Control, Walking in the Dark, and Motherhood on My Own Terms. Clinicians can provide sensitive, individualized care by asking women with Asperger syndrome about their specific sensory experiences, counseling them about coping strategies for sensory intrusions, providing targeted support, and modifying the clinical environment to decrease distressing stimuli.

When reading Michael Fitzgerald's chapter entitled 'Autism: Asperger's Syndrome-History and First Descriptions' in 'Asperger's Disorder' edited by Rausch, Johnson and Casanova, a while ago, one of us was struck by his contention that Kanner was guilty of plagiarism as well as non-attribution of Asperger's 1938 paper 'Das psychisch abnorme kind' (Fitzgerald in Asperger's disorder. Informa Healthcare, New York, 2008) published in a Vienna weekly. Steve Silberman has discovered evidence that Kanner rescued Asperger's chief diagnostician from the Nazis in 1944 so must have been aware of Asperger's work and conclusions. Fitzgerald was on the right track but it appears that Kanner may have plagiarised Asperger's ideas rather than his 1938 paper.

The present study examined whether adults with high functioning autism (HFA) showed greater difficulties in (1) their self-reported ability to empathise with others and/or (2) their ability to read mental states in others' eyes than adults with Asperger syndrome (AS). The Empathy Quotient (EQ) and 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' Test (Eyes Test) were compared in 43 adults with AS and 43 adults with HFA. No significant difference was observed on EQ score between groups, while adults with AS performed significantly better on the Eyes Test than those with HFA. This suggests that adults with HFA may need more support, particularly in mentalizing and complex emotion recognition, and raises questions about the existence of subgroups within autism spectrum conditions.

Just 42 % of officers were satisfied with how they had worked with individuals with ASD and reasons for this varied. Although officers acknowledged the need for adjustments, organisational/time constraints were cited as barriers. Whilst 37 % of officers had received training on ASD, a need for training tailored to policing roles (e.g., frontline officers, detectives) was identified. Police responses are discussed with respect to the experiences of the ASD community (31 adults with ASD, 49 parents), who were largely dissatisfied with their experience of the police and echoed the need for police training on ASD.

First described in 1944 by Hans Asperger (1944), it was not before 1994 that Asperger Syndrome (AS) was included in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, only to disappear in the Manual's fifth edition in 2013. During its brief existence as a diagnostic entity, AS aroused immense interest and controversy. Similar to patients with autism, AS patients show deficits in social interaction, inappropriate communication skills, and interest restriction, but also display a rich variety of subtle clinical characteristics that for many distinguish AS from autism. However, difficulties operationalising diagnostic criteria and differentiating AS from autism ultimately led to its merging into the unifying category of Autistic Spectrum Disorders. Here we briefly review the short history of this fascinating condition.

Recruiting adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) into research poses particular difficulties; longitudinal studies face additional challenges. This paper reports on a mixed methods study to identify factors influencing the participation in longitudinal autism research of adults with ASD, including those with an intellectual disability, and their carers. Common and differentiating factors influencing the research participation of participants are identified and discussed. Factors influencing participation were found to differ both between and within participant categories. We propose a dichotomy whereby factors influencing research participation can be classified as those arising from a participant's values, which act as either a motivator or a deterrent; and those based on convenience, which act as either an enabler or inhibitor. These findings are applicable to research studies that seek to recruit adults with ASD as participants.

Assuming that testosterone levels from a dizygotic male twin fetus may lead to enhanced testosterone exposure of its co-twins, we aimed to test the prenatal testosterone hypothesis by comparing same-sex with opposite-sex dizygotic twins with respect to neurodevelopmental symptoms.

Transgender and gender nonconforming people who fulfill diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) often present to mental health providers with concerns that are distinct from those without ASDs. Gender Dysphoria (GD) and ASDs have been proposed to share etiologic mechanisms and there is evidence that ASDs may be more common in transgender and gender nonconforming people. We explore the impact of ASD characteristics on individual gender identity, expression, and the process of psychotherapy.

This study reviews the available clinical and empirical data. A systematic search of the literature was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus; utilizing different combinations of the following search terms: autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Asperger's disorder (AD), co-morbidity, gender dysphoria (GD), gender identity disorder (GID), transgenderism and transsexualism. In total, 25 articles and reports were selected and discussed. Information was grouped by found co-occurrence rates, underlying hypotheses and implications for diagnosis and treatment. GD and ASD were found to co-occur frequently - sometimes characterized by atypical presentation of GD, which makes a correct diagnosis and determination of treatment options for GD difficult. Despite these challenges there are several case reports describing gender affirming treatment of co-occurring GD in adolescents and adults with ASD. Various underlying hypotheses for the link between GD and ASD were suggested, but almost all of them lack evidence.

Medical law review	2016	Karen O'Connell	Faculty of Law, University of Technology Sydney (UTS), 15 Broadway, Ultimo, NSW 2007, Australia karen.oconnell@uts.edu.au.	At a time when brain-based explanations of behaviour are proliferating, how will law respond to the badly behaved child? In Australia, children and youth with challenging behaviours such as aggression, swearing, or impulsivity are increasingly understood as having a behavioural disability and so may be afforded the protections of discrimination law. A brain-based approach to challenging behaviour also offers a seemingly neutral framework that de-stigmatises a child's 'bad' behaviour, making it a biological or medical issue rather than a failure of discipline or temperament. Yet this 'brain-based' framework is not as neutral as it appears. How law regulates the brain-based subject in the form of the badly behaved child depends on how law conceptualises the brain. This article examines two competing approaches to the brain in law: a structural, deterministic model and a 'plastic', flexible model. Each of these impacts differently on disabled and abled identity and consequently on discrimination law and equality rights. Using examples from Australian discrimination law, this article argues that as new brain-based models of identity develop, existing inequalities based on race, gender, and disability are imported, and new forms of stigma emerge. In the neurological age, not all brains are created equal.

We evaluated 1,892 and 1,589 mother-child pairs at the ages of 14 months and 5 years, respectively, in a population-based Spanish birth cohort established during 2004-2008. Bayley and McCarthy scales and the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test were used to assess neuropsychological development. Results from multivariate linear regression models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics and further adjusted for umbilical cord blood mercury or long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. Overall, consumption of seafood above the recommended limit of 340 g/week was associated with 10-g/week increments in neuropsychological scores. By subtype, in addition to lean fish, consumption of large fatty fish showed a positive association; offspring of persons within the highest quantile (>238 g/week) had an adjusted increase of 2.29 points in McCarthy general cognitive score (95% confidence interval: 0.42, 4.16). Similar findings were observed for the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test. Beta coefficients diminished 15%-30% after adjustment for mercury or long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations. Consumption of large fatty fish during pregnancy presents moderate child neuropsychological benefits, including improvements in cognitive functioning and some protection from autism-spectrum traits.

Harvard review of psychiatry	2016	David S Im	From the University of Michigan Medical School and Center for Forensic Psychiatry, Saline, MI.	For the past two decades, researchers have been using various approaches to investigate the relationship, if any, between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and violence. The need to clarify that relationship was reinforced by the tragic mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012 by an individual diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The purpose of this article is (1) to provide an updated review of the literature on the association between ASD and violence, and (2) to examine implications for treating, and for preventing violence by, individuals with ASD.

Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Falmer, BN1 9RR, UK.	Emotions and affective feelings are influenced by one's internal state of bodily arousal via interoception. Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are associated with difficulties in recognising others' emotions, and in regulating own emotions. We tested the hypothesis that, in people with ASC, such affective differences may arise from abnormalities in interoceptive processing. We demonstrated that individuals with ASC have reduced interoceptive accuracy (quantified using heartbeat detection tests) and exaggerated interoceptive sensibility (subjective sensitivity to internal sensations on self-report questionnaires), reflecting an impaired ability to objectively detect bodily signals alongside an over-inflated subjective perception of bodily sensations. The divergence of these two interoceptive axes can be computed as a trait prediction error. This error correlated with deficits in emotion sensitivity and occurrence of anxiety symptoms. Our results indicate an origin of emotion deficits and affective symptoms in ASC at the interface between body and mind, specifically in expectancy-driven interpretation of interoceptive information.

La Revue du praticien	2016	Bojan Mirkovic, François Pinabel, David Cohen	Service de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent, groupe hospitalier La Pitié-Salpêtrière, AP-HP, Paris, France.	Asperger's syndrome symptoms in children, adolescents and young adults. Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopemental disorder which is classified into autism- spectrums disorders (ASDs). AS is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, stereotyped and restricted patterns of behaviour, activities and interests. There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development nor general delay in language. However, there are specific abnormalities such as literal interpretations, miscomprehension of nuance, unusually pedantic and formal speech. Clinical aspects are very heterogeneous and vary depending on age and psychiatric comorbidities. Among the associated disorders, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, mood and anxiety disorders are commonly found. To identify these conditions and offer appropriate treatment, elevated vigilance is needed in clinical practice.

C.H.U. Tivoli Service de Pédopsychiatrie, Avenue Max Buset 34, La Louviére, Belgium.	The purpose of this paper is to examine the possible benefits to keep using the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. We first describe the evolution of this entity over time and within nomenclature bases such as the ICD- 10, the CFTMEA and the last versions of DSM. Then, we discuss more precisely the impact of the decision made in the DSM-5 to suppress the Asperger syndrome as a differentiated entity within the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). This disorder chapter by the way also disappears and is replaced by Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We present here three clinical cases encountered in an outpatient general child psychiatry clinic : 1 case was diagnosed as Asperger syndrome, 1 as infantile autism (early infantile autism) and 1 as another pervasive developmental disorder (psychotic disharmony). The objective was to expose the commonali ties and differences between these three entities. We conclude that keeping using the Asperger diagnosis is important for the clinical management of these clinical situations but also for the individual, his or her family and society at large.

Neurological soft signs (NSS) are frequently found in psychiatric disorders of significant neurodevelopmental origin. Previous MRI studies in schizophrenia have shown that NSS are associated with abnormal cortical, thalamic and cerebellar structure and function. So far, however, no neuroimaging studies investigated brain correlates of NSS in individuals with Asperger-Syndrome (AS) and the question whether the two disorders exhibit common or disease-specific cortical correlates of NSS remains unresolved. High-resolution MRI data at 3 T were obtained from 48 demographically matched individuals (16 schizophrenia patients, 16 subjects with AS and 16 healthy individuals). The surface-based analysis via Freesurfer enabled calculation of cortical thickness, area and folding (local gyrification index, LGI). NSS were examined on the Heidelberg Scale and related to cortical measures. In schizophrenia, higher NSS were associated with reduced cortical thickness and LGI in fronto-temporo-parietal brain areas. In AS, higher NSS were associated with increased frontotemporal cortical thickness. This study lends further support to the hypothesis that disorder-specific mechanisms contribute to NSS expression in schizophrenia and AS. Pointing towards dissociable neural patterns may help deconstruct the complex processes underlying NSS in these neurodevelopmental disorders.

Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan. School of Occupational Therapy and Social Work, Faculty of Health Sciences, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia.	This study explored the everyday life experiences of individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Fourteen Australians and 16 Taiwanese (aged 16-45 years) with Asperger syndrome/high functioning autism recorded what they were doing, level of interest/involvement, emotional reactions and preference for being alone 7 times/day for 7 days. Multilevel analyses showed that 'solitary/parallel leisure' and 'social activities' were positively associated with interest and involvement. Engaging in these two activities and interacting with friends were positively associated with enjoyment. However, engaging in 'social activities' and having less severe ASD symptoms were associated with in-the-moment anxiety. Severity of ASD and social anxiety moderated experience in social situations. The findings highlight the importance of considering the in-the-moment experience of people with ASD.

PloS one	2015	Anne-Marie Nader, Patricia Jelenic, Isabelle Soulières	Psychology Department, University of Quebec in Montreal, Montréal (QC), Canada. Research center of Institut universitaire en santé mentale de Montréal, Rivière-des-Prairies Hospital, Montreal (QC), Canada.	"The cognitive profile and measured intellectual level vary according to assessment tools in children on the autism spectrum, much more so than in typically developing children. The recent inclusion of intellectual functioning in the diagnostic process for autism spectrum disorders leads to the crucial question on how to assess intelligence in autism, especially as some tests and subtests seem more sensitive to certain neurodevelopmental conditions. Our first aim was to examine the cognitive profile on the current version of the most widely used test, the Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC-IV), for a homogenous subgroup of children on the autism spectrum, i.e. corresponding to DSM-IV diagnosis of ""autism"". The second aim was to compare cognitive profiles obtained on the third edition versus 4th edition of WISC, in order to verify whether the WISC-IV yields a more distinctive cognitive profile in autistic children. The third aim was to examine the impact of the WISC-IV on the cognitive profile of another subgroup, children with Asperger's Syndrome. 51 autistic, 15 Asperger and 42 typically developing children completed the WISC-IV and were individually matched to children who completed the WISC-III. Divergent WISC-IV profiles were observed despite no significant intelligence quotient difference between groups. Autistic children scored significantly higher on the Perceptual Reasoning Index than on the Verbal Comprehension Index, a discrepancy that nearly tripled in comparison to WISC-III results. Asperger children scored higher on the VCI than on other indexes, with the lowest score found on the Processing Speed Index. WISC-IV cognitive profiles were consistent with, but more pronounced than WISC-III profiles. Cognitive profiles are a valuable diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis, keeping in mind that children on the autism spectrum might be more sensitive to the choice of subtests used to assess intelligence."

Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners	2016	Sandra L Lobar		The purpose of this article is to highlight issues about diagnosis and management of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in all settings, along with care coordination for all children with ASDs. The article outlines differences between the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, revised (DSM-IV-TR) and the newer version (DSM-V) for ASDs. These changes may limit the eligibility of some children for services in school, leading to poorer social/academic outcomes, lower rates of employment, and decreased assistance in eventual independent living. Primary care providers identified a lack of knowledge regarding ASDs before the DSM-V was published, describing difficulty in making ASD diagnoses, recognizing early symptoms of developmental concern, and managing care. Care coordination is part of the role of the advanced practice nurse, and lack of understanding of ASD changes in the DSM-V may diminish the ability of advanced practice nurses to screen for ASDs and make the appropriate referrals.

The aim of this retrospective study was to retrace the trajectories and long-term outcomes of individuals with autism in France, and to explore the family experiences. Data obtained from parents enables us to follow the trajectories of 76 adults. Two-thirds of adults with severe autism had a very poor outcome. Those with moderate autism had a better outcome. In adulthood, the majority were in residential accommodation. None were living independently. The trajectories of people with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism were more positive since all of them attended school for a long time and some went to university. All of them had a good outcome but they remained dependent on aging parents who had few available supports.

Frontiers in psychology	2015	Rossana Actis-Grosso, Francesco Bossi, Paola Ricciardelli	Department of Psychology, University of Milano-Bicocca Milano, Italy. Department of Psychology, University of Milano-Bicocca Milano, Italy ; Milan Centre for Neuroscience Milano, Italy.	We investigated whether the type of stimulus (pictures of static faces vs. body motion) contributes differently to the recognition of emotions. The performance (accuracy and response times) of 25 Low Autistic Traits (LAT group) young adults (21 males) and 20 young adults (16 males) with either High Autistic Traits or with High Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder (HAT group) was compared in the recognition of four emotions (Happiness, Anger, Fear, and Sadness) either shown in static faces or conveyed by moving body patch-light displays (PLDs). Overall, HAT individuals were as accurate as LAT ones in perceiving emotions both with faces and with PLDs. Moreover, they correctly described non-emotional actions depicted by PLDs, indicating that they perceived the motion conveyed by the PLDs per se. For LAT participants, happiness proved to be the easiest emotion to be recognized: in line with previous studies we found a happy face advantage for faces, which for the first time was also found for bodies (happy body advantage). Furthermore, LAT participants recognized sadness better by static faces and fear by PLDs. This advantage for motion kinematics in the recognition of fear was not present in HAT participants, suggesting that (i) emotion recognition is not generally impaired in HAT individuals, (ii) the cues exploited for emotion recognition by LAT and HAT groups are not always the same. These findings are discussed against the background of emotional processing in typically and atypically developed individuals.

Electronic address: mcl45@cam.ac.uk. Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK; Cambridge Lifespan Asperger Syndrome Service (CLASS) Clinic, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK.	Autism spectrum conditions comprise a set of early-onset neurodevelopmental syndromes with a prevalence of 1% across all ages. First diagnosis in adulthood has finally become recognised as an important clinical issue due to the increasing awareness of autism, broadening of diagnostic criteria, and the introduction of the spectrum concept. Thus, the idea of a lost generation of people who were previously excluded from a diagnosis of classic autism has arisen. Making a first diagnosis of autism spectrum conditions in adults can be challenging for practical reasons (eg, no person to provide a developmental history), developmental reasons (eg, the acquisition of learnt or camouflaging strategies), and clinical reasons (eg, high frequency of co-occurring disorders). The diagnostic process includes referral, screening, interviews with informants and patients, and functional assessments. In delineating differential diagnoses, true comorbidities, and overlapping behaviour with other psychiatric diagnoses, particular attention should be paid to anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, psychosis, personality disorders, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Possible misdiagnosis, especially in women, should be explored. The creation of supportive, accepting, and autism-friendly social and physical environments is important and requires a coordinated effort across agencies and needs support from government policies.

In contrast to other autism spectrum disorders, chromosome abnormalities are rare in Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism. Consequently, AS was occasionally subjected to classical positional cloning. Here, we report on a case of AS associated with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 3. Further in silico analysis has identified a candidate gene for AS and has suggested a therapeutic strategy for manifestations of the chromosome rearrangement.
26510628	doi: 10.1177/0306624X15612719	Violent Fantasies in Young Men With Autism Spectrum Disorders: Dangerous or Miserable Misfits? Duty to Protect Whom?	International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology	2017	Mark T Palermo, Stefan Bogaerts	1 Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA. 3 Tilburg University, The Netherlands.	Predictability of dangerousness in association with mental disorders remains elusive, outside of a few relatively well-established risk factors for the prognostication of violence, such as male sex, the presence of a psychotic disorder, and comorbid substance abuse. In clinical practice, inquiry into the presence of aggressive or violent ideation, in the form of ideas of homicide or suicide, is part of a standard mental status examination. Nonetheless, fantasy life, when it concerns harm toward others, may not be as reliable an indicator of imminent danger as it may be in the case of self-harm. Five cases of young Italian men with Asperger syndrome and recurrent and extremely violent femicide fantasies are presented. While there is no direct correlation between autism spectrum conditions and violence, as other humans, persons with an autistic condition are capable of committing crimes, including homicide. All five had in common a number of characteristics and behaviors felt to be pathoplastic: All had been bullied, all had been romantically rejected, all were long-standing First Person Shooter (FPS) game players, and all were avid violent pornography consumers. The potential for an actual neurocognitive impact of violent video games, well documented in the literature, and its combination with personal life history and chronic habituation following long-standing violent pornography use is discussed in the context of social and emotional vulnerabilities. While aggressive fantasies cannot and should not be underestimated, in countries where duty to protect legislation does not exist, a clinical approach is imperative, as, incidentally, should be anywhere.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA. National Institutes of Health, USA. Health Resources and Services Administration, USA. University of Washington, USA.	Autism spectrum disorder diagnoses sometimes change due to misdiagnosis, maturation, or treatment. This study uses a probability-based national survey-the Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Services-to compare currently diagnosed (n = 1420) and previously diagnosed (n = 187) children aged 6-17 years based on retrospective parental reports of early concerns about their children's development, responses to those concerns by doctors and other healthcare providers, the type of provider who made the first autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, and the autism spectrum disorder subtype diagnoses received (if any). Propensity score matching was used to control for differences between the groups on children's current level of functioning and other current characteristics that may have been related to diagnosis loss. Approximately 13% of the children ever diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder were estimated to have lost the diagnosis, and parents of 74% of them believed it was changed due to new information. Previously diagnosed children were less likely to have parents with early concerns about verbal skills, nonverbal communication, learning, and unusual gestures or movements. They were also less likely to have been referred to and diagnosed by a specialist. Previously diagnosed children were less likely to have ever received a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder or autistic disorder.

Special ability in computing the day of week for given dates was observed in a 24 year-old male (FB) diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. FB performed almost flawlessly (98.2%) both with past and future dates, over a span of 40 years. Response latency was slower as temporal remoteness of future dates increased. Within the future timespan, FB's performance was consistent with the active use of calendar regularities. On the contrary, within the past timespan (for which no remoteness effect was seen), his performance was mainly linked to memory retrieval of personal events. The case presented here complements the existent literature on calendar calculators, as, for first time, two distinct day-date processing styles are described in the same individual.

Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by reduced attention to salient social stimuli. Here, we use two visual oddball tasks to investigate brain systems engaged during attention to social (face) and non-social (scene) stimuli. We focused on the dorsal and ventral subdivisions of the anterior insula (dAI and vAI, respectively), anatomically distinct regions contributing to a 'salience network' that is known to regulate attention to behaviorally meaningful stimuli. Children with ASD performed comparably to their typically developing (TD) peers, but they engaged the right dAI and vAI differently in response to deviant faces compared with deviant scenes. Multivariate activation patterns in the dAI reliably discriminated between children with ASD and TD children with 85% classification accuracy, and children with ASD activated the vAI more than their TD peers. Children with ASD and their TD peers also differed in dAI connectivity patterns to deviant faces, with stronger within-salience network interactions in the ASD group and stronger cross-network interactions in the TD group. Our findings point to atypical patterns of right anterior insula activation and connectivity in ASD and suggest that multiple functions subserved by the insula, including attention and affective processing of salient social stimuli, are aberrant in children with the disorder.

Human and Information Science Laboratory, NTT Communication Science Laboratories Atsugi, Japan ; Center for Baby Science, Doshisha University Kizugawa, Japan. Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan.	Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show impaired social interaction and communication, which may be related to their difficulties in speech production. To investigate the mechanisms of atypical speech production in this population, we examined feedback control by delaying the auditory feedback of their own speech, which degraded speech fluency. We also examined feedforward control by adding loud pink noise to the auditory feedback, which led to increased vocal effort in producing speech. The results of Japanese speakers show that, compared with neurotypical (NT) individuals, high-functioning adults with ASD (including Asperger's disorder, autistic disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) were more affected by delayed auditory feedback but less affected by external noise. These findings indicate that, in contrast to NT individuals, those with ASD relied more on feedback control than on feedforward control in speech production, which is consistent with the hypothesis that this population exhibits attenuated Bayesian priors.
26422904		The sensory experiences of adults with autism spectrum disorder: A qualitative analysis.	Perception	2015	Ashley E Robertson, R David R Simmons		It has been well established that individuals with autism spectrum disorder report unusual experiences with sensory stimuli compared with typically developing individuals. However, there is a paucity of research exploring the nature of such experiences. A focus group was conducted with six adults with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger syndrome. Data were coded and analysed using an inductive, qualitative thematic analysis. Four main themes encompassing both positive and negative sensory experiences emerged from these data: (a) the importance of particular aspects of stimuli in their perception, (b) the importance of having control over stimuli, (c) how emotions/mental states could impact/be impacted by sensory stimuli, and (d) physical responses to stimuli. These data are discussed alongside extant literature. Limitations, possible implications, and potential directions of future research are also discussed.

Endophenotypes are heritable and quantifiable markers that may assist in the identification of the complex genetic underpinnings of psychiatric conditions. Here we examined global hypoconnectivity as an endophenotype of autism spectrum conditions (ASCs). We studied well-matched groups of adolescent males with autism, genetically-related siblings of individuals with autism, and typically-developing control participants. We parcellated the brain into 258 regions and used complex-network analysis to detect a robust hypoconnectivity endophenotype in our participant group. We observed that whole-brain functional connectivity was highest in controls, intermediate in siblings, and lowest in ASC, in task and rest conditions. We identified additional, local endophenotype effects in specific networks including the visual processing and default mode networks. Our analyses are the first to show that whole-brain functional hypoconnectivity is an endophenotype of autism in adolescence, and may thus underlie the heritable similarities seen in adolescents with ASC and their relatives.

Health communication	2016	Sarah M Parsloe, Austin S Babrow	a School of Communication Studies , Ohio University.	The May 2013 release of the new version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) subsumed Asperger's syndrome under the wider diagnostic label of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The revision has created much uncertainty in the community affected by this condition. This study uses problematic integration theory and thematic analysis to investigate how participants in Wrong Planet, a large online community associated with autism and Asperger's syndrome, have constructed these uncertainties. The analysis illuminates uncertainties concerning both the likelihood of diagnosis and value of diagnosis, and it details specific issues within these two general areas of uncertainty. The article concludes with both conceptual and practical implications.
26379525	pii: 460	Normal Visual Acuity and Electrophysiological Contrast Gain in Adults with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2015	Ludger Tebartz van Elst, Michael Bach, Julia Blessing, Andreas Riedel, Emanuel Bubl	Section Visual Function, Eye Center, University Medical Center , Freiburg , Germany. Section for Experimental Neuropsychiatry, Department for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Albert-Ludwigs-University , Freiburg , Germany.	"A common neurodevelopmental disorder, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is defined by specific patterns in social perception, social competence, communication, highly circumscribed interests, and a strong subjective need for behavioral routines. Furthermore, distinctive features of visual perception, such as markedly reduced eye contact and a tendency to focus more on small, visual items than on holistic perception, have long been recognized as typical ASD characteristics. Recent debate in the scientific community discusses whether the physiology of low-level visual perception might explain such higher visual abnormalities. While reports of this enhanced, ""eagle-like"" visual acuity contained methodological errors and could not be substantiated, several authors have reported alterations in even earlier stages of visual processing, such as contrast perception and motion perception at the occipital cortex level. Therefore, in this project, we have investigated the electrophysiology of very early visual processing by analyzing the pattern electroretinogram-based contrast gain, the background noise amplitude, and the psychophysical visual acuities of participants with high-functioning ASD and controls with equal education. Based on earlier findings, we hypothesized that alterations in early vision would be present in ASD participants. This study included 33 individuals with ASD (11 female) and 33 control individuals (12 female). The groups were matched in terms of age, gender, and education level. We found no evidence of altered electrophysiological retinal contrast processing or psychophysical measured visual acuities. There appears to be no evidence for abnormalities in retinal visual processing in ASD patients, at least with respect to contrast detection."

Clinical neuropharmacology	2015	Roberto Canitano	Division of Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry, University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders including autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified as to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. All these categories are grouped together in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, classification under the category of Autism Spectrum Disorders.Behavioral disorders including irritability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, and aggression are additional symptoms found in up to 20% of children and adolescents with ASD and require careful evaluation for appropriate treatment. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is defined by impaired attention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, whereas ASD is defined by social dysfunction, communicative impairment, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. They should be distinctly evaluated in children and adolescents with ASD and intellectual disability in contrast to individuals without intellectual disability, because significant differences between these conditions exist. Mood disorders are also common in ASD and should be systematically investigated in this population of children and adolescents. Approximately 50% of children and adolescents with ASD receive medication for comorbid behavioral/ADHD and mood symptoms, mostly stimulants, antiepileptics and antipsychotics. Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment including medications for ADHD-like symptoms have recently been provided and should be carefully considered. Antiepileptic drugs are commonly used in ASDs with epilepsy, because seizures are associated with ASD in 10% to 30% of young patients, and as mood stabilizers. Lithium is another option for children and adolescents with ASD who present with symptoms of a mood disorder, such as elevated moods/euphoria, mania, and paranoia, whether accompanied or not by irritability. Experimental treatments are under investigation and currently include arbaclofen, a γ-aminobutyric acid agent, and N-acetylcisteine, a glutamate agent.

IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics	2015			Children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) suffer from deficits or developmental delays in symbolic thinking. In particular, they are often found lacking in pretend play during early childhood. Researchers believe that they encounter difficulty in generating and maintaining mental representation of pretense coupled with the immediate reality. We have developed an interactive system that explores the potential of Augmented Reality (AR) technology to visually conceptualize the representation of pretense within an open-ended play environment. Results from an empirical study involving children with ASC aged 4 to 7 demonstrated a significant improvement of pretend play in terms of frequency, duration and relevance using the AR system in comparison to a non computer-assisted situation. We investigated individual differences, skill transfer, system usability and limitations of the proposed AR system. We discuss design guidelines for future AR systems for children with ASC and other pervasive developmental disorders.

Frontiers in psychology	2015	Lee Gerdes, Charles H Tegeler, Sung W Lee	Department of Neurology, Wake Forest School of Medicine Winston-Salem, NC, USA. Brain State Technologies LLC Scottsdale, AZ, USA ; Running River School Sedona, AZ, USA. Brain State Technologies LLC Scottsdale, AZ, USA.	We propose to enliven educational practice by marrying a conception of education as guided human development, to an advanced scientific understanding of the brain known as allostasis (stability through change). The result is a groundwork for allostatic neuro-education (GANE). Education as development encompasses practices including the organic (homeschooling and related traditions), cognitive acquisition (emphasis on standards and testing), and the constructivist (aimed to support adaptive creativity for both learner and society). Allostasis views change to be the norm in biology, defines success in contexts of complex natural environments rather than controlled settings, and identifies the brain as the organ of central command. Allostatic neuro-education contrasts with education focused dominantly on testing, or neuroscience based on homeostasis (stability through constancy). The GANE perspective is to view learners in terms of their neurodevelopmental trajectories; its objective is to support authentic freedom, mediated by competent, integrated, and expansive executive functionality (concordant with the philosophy of freedom of Rudolf Steiner); and its strategy is to be attuned to rhythms in various forms (including those of autonomic arousal described in polyvagal theory) so as to enable experiential excitement for learning. The GANE presents a variety of testable hypotheses, and studies that explore prevention or mitigation of the effects of early life adversity or toxic stress on learning and development may be of particular importance. Case studies are presented illustrating use of allostatic neurotechnology by an adolescent male carrying diagnoses of Asperger's syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and a grade school girl with reading difficulties. The GANE is intended as a re-visioning of education that may serve both learners and society to be better prepared for the accelerating changes of the 21st century.

"The evolution of a local fragmented model of services for children with autism in Hong Kong emerged gradually over the past three decades with lack of government funding or support. This had been due to increasing number of children with autism being detected and referred for earlier assessment. With increasing pressure from parents due to long waiting time for assessment and training services and the increasing polarization by mass media there had been a gradual increasing public awareness over the past five years. Though still highly fragmented in the availability of services, there is a growing ""business model"" available in the community due to increasing need and lack of public funding for support. There is a lack of strategic planning for medical diagnostic and management issues in Hong Kong. Our University of Hong Kong based Autism Research Program was pioneered in 1985 based on the increasing load of autism cases referred for assessment for other developmental problems and diagnosed as Autism in the Duchess of Kent Children's Hospital. As the first author has been the staff of the University of Hong Kong, this program flourished as a research based program. The benefits of early identification and intervention of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) had been increasingly recognized, and with the increased public awareness and increasing trend of earlier diagnosis, there has been a continuously high demand from parents for earlier assessment and training for children suspected to have ASD. This model had not received extra funding for this integrated program for research, teaching and training in autism. We had to apply for various donations and grants to support the development of this pioneer program. The research output and organization of forums for public education and awareness are reviewed. The latter part of the paper reports the summary of clinical profile of autism cases (N=1441) assessed from 1985 to 2010 June under the University of Hong Kong. As the waiting time for initial developmental assessment for any children in Hong Kong is 12-24 months, we also report our preliminary experience with a newly launched triaging service provision for children suspected to be ASD since 2009, including multi-disciplinary assessment and parallel interim training in our university affiliated child assessment centre in Hong (N=89)."

"Within the new DSM-5, the currently differentiated subgroups of ""Autistic Disorder"" (299.0), ""Asperger's Disorder"" (299.80) and ""Pervasive Developmental Disorder"" (299.80) are replaced by the more general ""Autism Spectrum Disorder"". With regard to a patient-oriented and expedient advising therapy planning, however, the issue of an empirically reproducible and clinically feasible differentiation into subgroups must still be raised. Based on two Autism-rating-scales (ASDS and FSK), an exploratory two-step cluster analysis was conducted with N=103 children (age: 5-18) seen in our social-pediatric health care centre to examine potentially autistic symptoms. In the two-cluster solution of both rating scales, mainly the problems in social communication grouped the children into a cluster ""with communication problems"" (51 % and 41 %), and a cluster ""without communication problems"". Within the three-cluster solution of the ASDS, sensory hypersensitivity, cleaving to routines and social-communicative problems generated an ""autistic"" subgroup (22%). The children of the second cluster (""communication problems"", 35%) were only described by social-communicative problems, and the third group did not show any problems (38%). In the three-cluster solution of the FSK, the ""autistic cluster"" of the two-cluster solution differentiated in a subgroup with mainly social-communicative problems (cluster 1) and a second subgroup described by restrictive, repetitive behavior. The different cluster solutions will be discussed with a view to the new DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, for following studies a further specification of some of the ASDS and FSK items could be helpful."

"Leo Kanner begins his landmark 1943 case series on autistic children by stating the condition was first brought to his attention in 1938. Recent letters to JADD have described this reference as ""mysterious"" and speculated it refers to papers published that year by Despert or Asperger. In fact, as Kanner goes on to state, 1938 is when he examined the first child in his case series. An exchange of letters with Despert and later writing by Kanner also point to the originality of his observations."

We examined comorbid psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders in fifty adult males (mean age 30 years) with Asperger syndrome (AS) diagnosed in childhood and followed up prospectively for almost two decades (13-26 years). Only three of the 50 men had never met criteria for an additional psychiatric/neurodevelopmental diagnosis and more than half had ongoing comorbidity (most commonly either ADHD or depression or both). Any psychiatric comorbidity increased the risk of poorer outcome. The minority of the AS group who no longer met criteria for a full diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder were usually free of current psychiatric comorbidity. The high rate of psychiatric/neurodevelopmental comorbidities underscores the need for a full psychiatric/neurodevelopmental assessment at follow-up of males with AS.

Faculty of Human Development and Education, Kyoto Women's University, Kyoto, Japan. Faculty of Human-Environment Studies, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.	Although social cognitive deficits have long been thought to underlie the characteristic and pervasive difficulties with social interaction observed in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), several recent behavioral and neuroimaging studies have indicated that visual perceptual impairments might also play a role. People with ASD show a robust bias towards detailed information at the expense of global information, although the mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon remain elusive. To address this issue, we investigated the functional field of view in a group of high-functioning children with autism (n = 13) and a paired non-ASD group (n = 13). Our results indicate that the ability to correctly detect and identify stimuli sharply decreases with greater eccentricity from the fovea in people with ASD. Accordingly, a probe analysis revealed that the functional field of view in the ASD group was only about 6.62° of retinal eccentricity, compared with 8.57° in typically developing children. Thus, children with ASD appear to have a narrower functional field of view. These results challenge the conventional hypothesis that the deficit in global processing in individuals with ASD is solely due to weak central coherence. Alternatively, our data suggest that a narrower functional field of view may also contribute to this bias.

Recent research has suggested that the prevalence of problematic substance use within the Asperger syndrome population has previously been underestimated. Furthermore, there is some indication that problematic substance use might take place to manage the traits of Asperger syndrome; however this possibility has yet to be examined in detail. This study aimed to address this omission by exploring individuals' perceptions of their substance use in relation to their diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.

Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication, alongside the presence of unusually repetitive, restricted interests and stereotyped behaviour. Individuals with AS have no delay in cognitive and language development. It is a subset of Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC), which are highly heritable and has a population prevalence of approximately 1%. Few studies have investigated the genetic basis of AS. To address this gap in the literature, we performed a genome-wide pooled DNA association study to identify candidate loci in 612 individuals (294 cases and 318 controls) of Caucasian ancestry, using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping version 6.0 array. We identified 11 SNPs that had a p-value below 1x10-5. These SNPs were independently genotyped in the same sample. Three of the SNPs (rs1268055, rs7785891 and rs2782448) were nominally significant, though none remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Two of our top three SNPs (rs7785891 and rs2782448) lie in loci previously implicated in ASC. However, investigation of the three SNPs in the ASC genome-wide association dataset from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium indicated that these three SNPs were not significantly associated with ASC. The effect sizes of the variants were modest, indicating that our study was not sufficiently powered to identify causal variants with precision.

Frontiers in integrative neuroscience	2015	Eduardo Mercado, Barbara A Church, Mariana V C Coutinho, Alexander Dovgopoly, Christopher J Lopata, Jennifer A Toomey, Marcus L Thomeer	Department of Psychology, The State University of New York Buffalo, NY, USA. Summit Educational Resources Getzville, NY, USA. Institute for Autism Research, Canisius College, Buffalo, NY USA.	Previous research suggests that high functioning (HF) children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sometimes have problems learning categories, but often appear to perform normally in categorization tasks. The deficits that individuals with ASD show when learning categories have been attributed to executive dysfunction, general deficits in implicit learning, atypical cognitive strategies, or abnormal perceptual biases and abilities. Several of these psychological explanations for category learning deficits have been associated with neural abnormalities such as cortical underconnectivity. The present study evaluated how well existing neurally based theories account for atypical perceptual category learning shown by HF children with ASD across multiple category learning tasks involving novel, abstract shapes. Consistent with earlier results, children's performances revealed two distinct patterns of learning and generalization associated with ASD: one was indistinguishable from performance in typically developing children; the other revealed dramatic impairments. These two patterns were evident regardless of training regimen or stimulus set. Surprisingly, some children with ASD showed both patterns. Simulations of perceptual category learning could account for the two observed patterns in terms of differences in neural plasticity. However, no current psychological or neural theory adequately explains why a child with ASD might show such large fluctuations in category learning ability across training conditions or stimulus sets.

Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.	Increased public awareness of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and routine screening in primary care have contributed to increased requests for diagnostic ASD evaluations. However, given the scarcity of subspecialty autism diagnostic resources, overreferral of children suspected of having ASD may be contributing to long waiting lists at tertiary care autism centers and delaying diagnosis for those children who truly have ASD. To determine whether children are being excessively referred to ASD-specific diagnostic clinics, our objective was to determine the prevalence of true ASD diagnoses in children referred for diagnostic ASD evaluation. Charts of all patients referred to a regional autism center between April 2011 and August 2012 for suspicion of a possible ASD were retrospectively reviewed and demographic and clinical diagnoses abstracted. Only 214 of 348 patients evaluated (61%) received an ASD diagnosis. Thus, concerns about autism are not confirmed by an ASD diagnosis in a significant number of children.

While various screening instruments for autism spectrum disorders are widely used in diagnostic assessments, their psychometric properties have not been simultaneously evaluated in the outpatient setting where these instruments are used most. In this study, we tested the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised and two short versions of the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, the AQ-28 and AQ-10, in 210 patients referred for autism spectrum disorder assessment and in 63 controls. Of the 210 patients, 139 received an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and 71 received another psychiatric diagnosis. The positive predictive values indicate that these tests correctly identified autism spectrum disorder patients in almost 80% of the referred cases. However, the negative predictive values suggest that only half of the referred patients without autism spectrum disorder were correctly identified. The sensitivity and specificity of each of these instruments were much lower than the values reported in the literature. In this study, the sensitivity of the Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised was the highest (73%), and the Autism-Spectrum Quotient short forms had the highest specificity (70% and 72%). Based on the similar area under the curve values, there is no clear preference for any of the three instruments. None of these instruments have sufficient validity to reliably predict a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in outpatient settings.

One of the most consistent findings in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) research is a higher rate of ASD diagnosis in males than females. Despite this, remarkably little research has focused on the reasons for this disparity. Better understanding of this sex difference could lead to major advancements in the prevention or treatment of ASD in both males and females. In October of 2014, Autism Speaks and the Autism Science Foundation co-organized a meeting that brought together almost 60 clinicians, researchers, parents, and self-identified autistic individuals. Discussion at the meeting is summarized here with recommendations on directions of future research endeavors.

Dublin North City & County C.A.M.H.S., Metropolitan Building, James Joyce Street, Dublin 1, Ireland.	Among the core features of ASD, altered sensitivities in all modalities have been accorded increasing importance. Heightened sensitivity to pain and unusual expressions of and reaction to pain have not hitherto been widely recognised as a presenting feature of ASD in general paediatrics. Failure to recognise ASD as a common cause of pain can lead to late diagnosis, inappropriate treatment, distress, and further disability. Two cases are presented which illustrate the late presentation of Autism Spectrum Disorder (Asperger's Syndrome subtype) with chronic unusual pain. Conclusion. Pain in autism can be atypical in its experience and expression and for this reason may go unrecognised by physicians treating chronic pain disorders.

The proportion of children presenting comorbidities was reported. 1123 children with ASD were recorded (M/F ratio: 4.1), representing an overall prevalence rate of 36.5/10,000 children (95 % CI 34.4-38.7): 8.8/10,000 for CA (95 % CI 7.8-9.9), 1.7/10,000 for AS (95 % CI 1.3-2.3) and 25.9/10,000 for other ASD (95 % CI 24.2-27.8). ASD prevalence significantly increased (p < 0.0001) during the period under study. The proportion of children with an intellectual disability was 47.3 %, all other comorbidities were present in less than 5 % of the cases.

South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK.	Autism spectrum disorders are characterised by impairments in communication and social interaction. Social skills interventions have been found to ameliorate socio-communication deficits in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Little is known about the effectiveness of social skills interventions for adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (hf-ASD) - a clinical population who can present with more subtle core deficits, but comparable levels of impairment and secondary difficulties. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of social skills interventions for adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders. Five studies met the pre-specified review inclusion criteria: two quasi-experimental comparative trials and three single-arm interventions. There was a degree of variation in the structure, duration and content of the social skills interventions delivered, as well as several methodological limitations associated with included studies. Nevertheless, narrative analysis tentatively indicates that group social skills interventions may be effective for enhancing social knowledge and understanding, improving social functioning, reducing loneliness and potentially alleviating co-morbid psychiatric symptoms.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2016	Mark Brosnan, Elizabeth Mills	University of Bath, UK. University of Bath, UK M.J.Brosnan@Bath.ac.uk.	Given the removal of Asperger's Syndrome label in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition, the impact of clinical labels upon the affective responses of college students was explored. A total of 120 college students read two vignettes depicting social interactions typical of a person with autism spectrum disorder. In one vignette, they were informed that the character was a typical college student and in the other, the character had a clinical disorder (either autism spectrum disorder, Asperger's Syndrome or Schizophrenia). Participants' affective responses were measured on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. No significant differences in positive and negative affective responses were found between the clinical labels. However, affective responses were significantly more positive and less negative towards behaviours associated with clinical groups compared to the typical college student. The implications for students disclosing their diagnosis at university are discussed.

To test this, we asked 465 American adults to read a vignette describing a child with autistic symptoms that included an ASD label, an Asperger's label, or no label, and rate their stigma and treatment attitudes (help-seeking and perceived effectiveness). Contrary to predictions, label did not impact stigma. Label did impact treatment attitudes, with greater help-seeking and perceived treatment effectiveness for both Asperger's and ASD labels. In sum, concern that the ASD label will increase negative perceptions, at least amongst the general public, is not supported.

This paper highlights the clinical challenges faced when assessing patients with stalking behaviors with psychotic disorders, suggesting the need for an accurate assessment of adult autism spectrum symptoms. A 25-year-old man with a diagnosis of delusional disorder, erotomanic type, was hospitalized for acute psychotic symptoms occurred in the framework of a repeated stalking behavior towards his ex girlfriend. When assessed for adult autism spectrum symptoms upon an accurate clinical evaluation, he reported elevated scores in the mentalizing deficit and social anxiety domains by means of the 14 item Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale (RAADS-14). Authors discuss a possible role of adult (subthreshold) autism spectrum symptoms, generally disregarded in adult psychiatry, on the type of psychotic features and stalking behavior developed that may help for appropriate diagnosis and treatment.

Electronic address: Kristen.bottema-beutel@bc.edu. Lynch School of Education, Boston College, 140 Commonwealth Ave., Chestnut Hill, MA 02467, United States.	This Conversation Analytic study examined the talk of an adolescent with Asperger syndrome (under previously used diagnostic criteria), Nathan, as he interacts with peers in a small group setting. We focused on Nathan's repetition aimed at pursuing response, and rely on analytical frameworks including response mobilization, face-work, and agreement preference. We found that while Nathan's repetitions resembled 'topic perseveration' previously described in the literature, they showed evidence of interactional awareness as they were employed when peers offered little or no response to his original utterance. However, we also found that while much of Nathan's talk was sophisticatedly structured, his repetition to pursue response eschewed interaction rituals that work to maintain social cohesion. As a result, Nathan's interactional priorities appeared mis-aligned with those of his peers, and failed to produce extended interactions in most cases.

Floating Hospital at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.	A small pilot program of 9 youth 13 to 18 years old with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or Asperger's syndrome assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of an individualized mentoring program. Youth met weekly for 6 months with trained young adult mentors at a local boys and girls club. Participants reported improvements in self-esteem, social anxiety, and quality of life. Participants, parents, mentors, and staff reported that the program improved participants' social connectedness. Although the pilot study was small, it provides preliminary data that mentoring for youth with ASD has promise for increasing self-esteem, social skills, and quality of life.

Childhood maltreatment is known to increase the risk of future psychiatric disorders. In the present study, we explored the impact of experienced maltreatment on the prevalence and comorbidity of psychiatric disorders in a high-risk population of adolescents in residential care units. We also studied the impact of poly-victimization. The participants of the study were adolescents in residential care units in Norway (n=335, mean age 16.8 years, girls 58.5%). A diagnostic interview (Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Assessment Interview) was used, yielding information about previous maltreatment (witnessing violence, victim of family violence, community violence, sexual abuse) and DSM-IV diagnoses present in the last three months. Exposure to maltreatment was reported by 71%, and in this group, we found significantly more Asperger's syndrome (AS) (p=.041), conduct disorder (CD) (p=.049), major depressive disorder (MDD) (p=.001), dysthymia (p=.030), general anxiety disorder (GAD) (p<.001), and having attempted suicide (p=.006). We found significantly more comorbid disorders in the maltreated group. Poly-victimization was studied by constructing a scale comprised of witnessing violence, victim of family violence, victim of sexual abuse and household dysfunction. We found that poly-victimization was associated with significantly increased risk of MDD, GAD, AS, CD, and having attempted suicide (p<.01). The complexity of the clinical outcomes revealed in this study suggest that longer-term treatment plans and follow-up by psychiatric services might be needed to a greater extend than for the rest of the child and adolescent population, and that trauma informed care is essential for adolescents in residential youth care.

Despite the increased global prevalence and recognition of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), it is still scarcely reported in the Arab world. Though Israel has a higher prevalence of ASD, a previous national survey of patients diagnosed between 1972 and 2004, demonstrated that 98% of them were of Jewish ancestry. The disproportional low number of Arab children with ASD in Israel is unclear but may reflect lower awareness and cultural bias. In the present study we collected clinical and demographic characteristics of 200 children with ASD from Arab and Jewish sectors in Israel that were evaluated in two child development centers. We compared the incidence and the medical comorbidity of autism between these two ethnics groups. The medical and psychiatric comorbidity profile in these children was similar to the worldwide published studies. In the present study the prevalence of autism in the Arab sector in Israel was similar to that of the Jewish sector. The Arab patients presented with more severe autistic manifestations and higher incidence of mental retardation, familial members with autism, and consanguinity (P < 0.05), while in the Jewish sector milder forms (such as Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS) were more frequent. This discrepancy might be explained by both genetic and cultural factors.

Indian journal of psychological medicine	2015	Priya Sreedaran, M V Ashok	Department of Psychiatry, St. John's Medical College, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India.	Asperger syndrome (AS) is an autism spectrum disorder with a high rate of psychiatric comorbidity. We describe the clinical profile and psychiatric comorbidity in a series of affected individuals referred to an Indian general hospital psychiatry setting. Gilliam Asperger's disorder scale was used to evaluate the clinical characteristics while Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)-KID and MINI-PLUS were used to assess psychiatric comorbidity. The profile of subjects with AS in our case-series appears similar to that published elsewhere with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Mental health professionals should evaluate for psychiatric comorbidity in individuals with autism spectrum disorders.

Although wild-type hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) is lacking the consensus sequence motif NX(S/T), in 1995 Trudel et al. (Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995, 73, 307-309) proposed the existence of a low abundant N-glycosylated form of HEL; however, the identity of active glycosylation sites in HEL remained a matter of speculation. For the first time since Trudel's initial work, we report here a comprehensive characterization by means of mass spectrometry of N-glycosylation in wild-type HEL. Our analytical approach comprised ZIC-HILIC enrichment of N-glycopeptides from HEL trypsin digest, deglycosylation by (18)O/PNGase F as well as by various endoglycosidases, and LC-MS/MS analysis of both intact and deglycosylated N-glycopeptides engaging multiple techniques of ionization and fragmentation. A novel data interpretation workflow based on MS/MS spectra classification and glycan database searching enabled the straightforward identification of the asparagine-rich N-glycopeptide [34-45] FESNFNTQATNR and allowed for compositional profiling of its modifying N-glycans. The overall heterogeneity profile of N-glycans in HEL comprised at least 26 different compositions. Results obtained from deglycosylation experiments provided clear evidence of asparagine residues N44 and N39 representing active glycosylation sites in HEL. Both of these sites do not fall into any known N-glycosylation-specific sequence motif but are localized in rarely observed nonconsensus sequons (NXN, NXQ).

Although now believed to be two distinct disorders, autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) share multiple phenotypic similarities and risk factors, and have been reported to co-occur at elevated rates. In this narrative review, we give a brief overview of the phenomenological, genetic, environmental, and imaging evidence for the overlap between ASD and SSD, highlighting similarities and areas of distinction. We examine eight possible alternate models of explanation for the association and comorbidity between the disorders, and set out a research agenda to test these models. Understanding how and why these disorders co-occur has important implications for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis, as well as for developing fundamental aetiological models of the disorders.

A closed-ended intensive pediatric swallowing telepractice program was developed and piloted in one pediatric patient with Opitz BBB/G and Asperger's Syndromes, oropharyngeal dysphagia and aerophagia. The present study is a case report. Outcome variables included behavioral, swallowing and quality of life variables, and were assessed at baseline and at the end of the four-week program. Selective variables were also assessed at a follow-up family interview four weeks post program completion. Over the four-week intervention period, the patient demonstrated substantial improvements in: oral acceptance of eating-related objects and a variety of foods (behavioral variable), timing of voluntary saliva swallows and aerophagia levels (swallowing variables) and quality of life. Follow-up interview analysis showed that most skills were retained or improved one-month post intervention. This intensive telepractice program proved to be feasible and effective for this pediatric patient with dysphagia.

Integrative psychological & behavioral science	2015	Elinor Ochs	Department of Anthropology, University of California, Los Angeles, 341 Haines Hall, Los Angeles, 90095-1553, USA, eochs@anthro.ucla.edu.	Ethnographic video recordings of high functioning children with autism or Aspergers Syndrome in everyday social encounters evidence their first person perspectives. High quality visual and audio data allow detailed analysis of children's bodies and talk as loci of reflexivity. Corporeal reflexivity involves displays of awareness of one's body as an experiencing subject and a physical object accessible to the gaze of others. Gaze, demeanor, actions, and sotto voce commentaries on unfolding situations indicate a range of moment-by-moment reflexive responses to social situations. Autism is associated with neurologically based motor problems (e.g. delayed action-goal coordination, clumsiness) and highly repetitive movements to self-soothe. These behaviors can provoke derision among classmates at school. Focusing on a 9-year-old girl's encounters with peers on the playground, this study documents precisely how autistic children can become enmeshed as unwitting objects of stigma and how they reflect upon their social rejection as it transpires. Children with autism spectrum disorders in laboratory settings manifest diminished understandings of social emotions such as embarrassment, as part of a more general impairment in social perspective-taking. Video ethnography, however, takes us further, into discovering autistic children's subjective sense of vulnerability to the gaze of classmates.

Department of Social and Welfare Studies, Linköping University, Sweden. Stockholm University, Sweden.	The purpose of this study was to describe and explore the experiences of support at school among young adults with Asperger's disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and also to examine what support they, in retrospect, described as influencing learning. Purposive sampling was used to enroll participants. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 13 young adults aged between 20 and 29 years. A qualitative analysis, based on interpreting people's experiences, was conducted by grouping and searching for patterns in data. The findings indicate that the participants experienced difficulties at school that included academic, social, and emotional conditions, all of which could influence learning. Support for learning included small groups, individualized teaching methods, teachers who cared, and practical and emotional support. These clusters together confirm the overall understanding that support for learning aligns academic and psychosocial support. In conclusion, academic support combined with psychosocial support at school seems to be crucial for learning among students with Asperger's disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Journal of applied behavior analysis	2015	Dorothea C Lerman, Lynn Hawkins, Conrad Hillman, Molly Shireman, Melissa A Nissen	University Of Houston, Clear Lake.	Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who were interested in working as behavior technicians for young children with autism, participated in 2 experiments. Participants included 5 adults with Asperger syndrome or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, 19 to 23 years old, and 11 children with autism, 3 to 7 years old. In Experiment 1, training of the adults focused on the implementation of mand training via incidental teaching. Experiment 2 focused on teaching participants to use discrete-trial training (DTT) with children who exhibited problem behavior. Both experiments showed that behavioral skills training was effective for teaching the adult participants the behavioral procedures needed to teach children with autism. In addition, the children acquired skills as a result of training. Results of Experiment 2 further demonstrated that the DTT skills generalized across untrained targets and children. Social validity ratings suggested that some participants' teaching was indistinguishable from that of individuals without ASD.

Electronic address: r.v.cooper@lancaster.ac.uk.	"The latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the D.S.M.-5, was published in May 2013. In the lead up to publication, radical changes to the classification were anticipated; there was widespread dissatisfaction with the previous edition and it was accepted that a ""paradigm shift"" might be required. In the end, however, and despite huge efforts at revision, the published D.S.M.-5 differs far less than originally envisaged from its predecessor. This paper considers why it is that revising the D.S.M. has become so difficult. The D.S.M. is such an important classification that this question is worth asking in its own right. The case of the D.S.M. can also serve as a study for considering stasis in classification more broadly; why and how can classifications become resistant to change? I suggest that classifications like the D.S.M. can be thought of as forming part of the infrastructure of science, and have much in common with material infrastructure. In particular, as with material technologies, it is possible for ""path dependent"" development to cause a sub-optimal classification to become ""locked in"" and hard to replace."

Neural Systems Group, Massachusetts General Hospital, 149 13th St, Charlestown, Massachusetts, 02129.	Movement atypicalities in speed, coordination, posture, and gait have been observed across the autism spectrum (AS) and atypicalities in coordination are more commonly observed in AS individuals without delayed speech (DSM-IV Asperger) than in those with atypical or delayed speech onset. However, few studies have provided quantitative data to support these mostly clinical observations. Here, we compared perceptual and motor performance between 30 typically developing and AS individuals (21 with speech delay and 18 without speech delay) to examine the associations between limb movement control and atypical speech development. Groups were matched for age, intelligence, and sex. The experimental design included: an inspection time task, which measures visual processing speed; the Purdue Pegboard, which measures finger dexterity, bimanual performance, and hand-eye coordination; the Annett Peg Moving Task, which measures unimanual goal-directed arm movement; and a simple reaction time task. We used analysis of covariance to investigate group differences in task performance and linear regression models to explore potential associations between intelligence, language skills, simple reaction time, and visually guided movement performance. AS participants without speech delay performed slower than typical participants in the Purdue Pegboard subtests. AS participants without speech delay showed poorer bimanual coordination than those with speech delay. Visual processing speed was slightly faster in both AS groups than in the typical group. Altogether, these results suggest that AS individuals with and without speech delay differ in visually guided and visually triggered behavior and show that early language skills are associated with slower movement in simple and complex motor tasks.

Institute of Human Development, University of Manchester, UK; Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Central Manchester University Foundation NHS Trust, Manchester, UK.	A clinical scenario of a young female on 800 mg of sodium valproate (VPA) who has recently failed lamotrigine (LTG) and levetiracetam (LEV) and who is currently planning a pregnancy is presented. Currently available data pertaining to the longer-term development of children exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are reviewed along with considerations around the methodology and interpretation of such research. There is an accumulation of data highlighting significant risks associated with prenatal exposed to VPA, with the level of risk being mediated by dose. The majority of published evidence does not find a significant risk associated with carbamazepine (CBZ) exposure in utero for global cognitive abilities however the evidence for more specific cognitive skills are unclear. Limited data indicate that LTG may be a preferred treatment to VPA in terms of foetal outcome but further evidence is required. Too little data pertaining to LEV exposure is available and a lack of evidence regarding risk of this and other new AEDs should not be interpreted as evidence of safety.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2015	Lisa Fiene, Charlotte Brownlow	School of Psychology and Counselling, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Queensland, 4350, Australia.	This study aimed to investigate the current gap in the literature with regard to how adults with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) interpret elements of the interoceptive sense, which includes thirst, hunger, temperature, satiety, and the prediction of onset of illness. Adults with a diagnosed ASD (n = 74; 36 males, 38 females) were compared to a control group (n = 228; 53 males, 174 females, 1 unspecified) in their self-reported perceptions of body awareness utilizing the Body Awareness Questionnaire (BAQ) and thirst awareness using the Thirst Awareness Scale (TAS). Those in the ASD group reported a clinically significant lower body and thirst awareness compared to the control group, and this was a large effect (BAQ; d = -1.26, P < 0.001; TAS; d = -1.02, P < 0.001). These findings are of clinical importance, as difficulty with sensing internal bodily states could theoretically impact on the physical and mental health, social interactions and self-awareness of adults with ASD.
25805985	pii: 115	Collinear facilitation and contour integration in autism: evidence for atypical visual integration.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2015	Stephen Jachim, Paul A Warren, Niall McLoughlin, Emma Gowen	Faculty of Life Sciences, University of Manchester Manchester, UK. Psychological Sciences, University of Manchester Manchester, UK.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, atypical communication and a restricted repertoire of interests and activities. Altered sensory and perceptual experiences are also common, and a notable perceptual difference between individuals with ASD and controls is their superior performance in visual tasks where it may be beneficial to ignore global context. This superiority may be the result of atypical integrative processing. To explore this claim we investigated visual integration in adults with ASD (diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome) using two psychophysical tasks thought to rely on integrative processing-collinear facilitation and contour integration. We measured collinear facilitation at different flanker orientation offsets and contour integration for both open and closed contours. Our results indicate that compared to matched controls, ASD participants show (i) reduced collinear facilitation, despite equivalent performance without flankers; and (ii) less benefit from closed contours in contour integration. These results indicate weaker visuospatial integration in adults with ASD and suggest that further studies using these types of paradigms would provide knowledge on how contextual processing is altered in ASD.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2015	Isaac C Smith, Brian Reichow, Fred R Volkmar		A growing body of research has raised concerns about the number of individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) according to DSM-IV-TR who may no longer qualify for diagnoses under the new DSM-5 criteria, published in May 2013. The current study systematically reviews 25 articles evaluating samples according to both DSM-IV-TR and DSM-5 ASD criteria. Consistent with previous reviews, the majority of included studies indicated between 50 and 75% of individuals will maintain diagnoses. We conducted visual analyses of subgroups using harvest plots and found the greatest decreases among high-functioning populations with IQs over 70 and/or previous diagnoses of PDD-NOS or Asperger's disorder. We discuss the potential research and clinical implications of reduced numbers of individuals diagnosed with ASD.
25784058	doi: 10.1017/S1355617715000168	The value of Bayes' theorem for interpreting abnormal test scores in cognitively healthy and clinical samples.	Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	2015	Brandon E Gavett	Department of Psychology,University of Colorado,Colorado Springs,Colorado.	The base rates of abnormal test scores in cognitively normal samples have been a focus of recent research. The goal of the current study is to illustrate how Bayes' theorem uses these base rates--along with the same base rates in cognitively impaired samples and prevalence rates of cognitive impairment--to yield probability values that are more useful for making judgments about the absence or presence of cognitive impairment. Correlation matrices, means, and standard deviations were obtained from the Wechsler Memory Scale--4th Edition (WMS-IV) Technical and Interpretive Manual and used in Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the base rates of abnormal test scores in the standardization and special groups (mixed clinical) samples. Bayes' theorem was applied to these estimates to identify probabilities of normal cognition based on the number of abnormal test scores observed. Abnormal scores were common in the standardization sample (65.4% scoring below a scaled score of 7 on at least one subtest) and more common in the mixed clinical sample (85.6% scoring below a scaled score of 7 on at least one subtest). Probabilities varied according to the number of abnormal test scores, base rates of normal cognition, and cutoff scores. The results suggest that interpretation of base rates obtained from cognitively healthy samples must also account for data from cognitively impaired samples. Bayes' theorem can help neuropsychologists answer questions about the probability that an individual examinee is cognitively healthy based on the number of abnormal test scores observed.

Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback	2015	Genomary Krigbaum, Nancy L Wigton		19-Channel Z-Score Neurofeedback (19ZNF) is a modality using 19-electrodes with real-time normative database z-scores, suggesting effective clinical outcomes in fewer sessions than traditional neurofeedback. Thus, monitoring treatment progression and clinical outcome is necessary. The area of focus in this study was a methodology of quantitative analysis for monitoring treatment progression and clinical outcome with 19ZNF. This methodology is noted as the Sites-of-Interest, which included repeated measures analyses of variance (rANOVA) and t-tests for z-scores; it was conducted on 10 cases in a single subject design. To avoid selection bias, the 10 sample cases were randomly selected from a pool of 17 cases that met the inclusion criteria. Available client outcome measures (including self-report) are briefly discussed. The results showed 90% of the pre-post comparisons moved in the targeted direction (z = 0) and of those, 96% (80% Bonferroni corrected) of the t-tests and 96% (91% Bonferroni corrected) of the rANOVAs were statistically significant; thus indicating a progression towards the mean in 15 or fewer 19ZNF sessions. All cases showed and reported improvement in all outcome measures (including quantitative electroencephalography assessment) at case termination.

Psychiatria Danubina	2015	Mandy Roy, Vanessa Prox-Vagedes, Martin D Ohlmeier, Wolfgang Dillo		Over the past few years, our knowledge about Asperger syndrome (AS) has increased enormously. Although it used to be a syndrome mainly encountered in childhood and adolescent psychiatry, it is now increasingly recognized in adult psychiatry. Nevertheless, little is known about psychiatric comorbidities and life course of adults with AS. The current study aimed to gain an insight into comorbidities and the development of the social situation of adults with AS.

Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by difficulties in communication and social interaction, alongside unusually repetitive behaviours and narrow interests. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is one subgroup of ASC and differs from classic autism in that in AS there is no language or general cognitive delay. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors are implicated in ASC and genes involved in neural connectivity and neurodevelopment are good candidates for studying the susceptibility to ASC. The aryl-hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator 2 (ARNT2) gene encodes a transcription factor involved in neurodevelopmental processes, neuronal connectivity and cellular responses to hypoxia. A mutation in this gene has been identified in individuals with ASC and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been nominally associated with AS and autistic traits in previous studies.
25741261	pii: 24	Figurative language processing in atypical populations: the ASD perspective.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2015	Mila Vulchanova, David Saldaña, Sobh Chahboun, Valentin Vulchanov	Individual Differences, Language and Cognition Lab, Department of Developmental and Educational Psychology, University of Seville Seville, Spain. Language Acquisition and Language Processing Lab, Department of Language and Literature, Norwegian University of Science and Technology Trondheim, Norway.	This paper is intended to provide a critical overview of experimental and clinical research documenting problems in figurative language processing in atypical populations with a focus on the Autistic Spectrum. Research in the comprehension and processing of figurative language in autism invariably documents problems in this area. The greater paradox is that even at the higher end of the spectrum or in the cases of linguistically talented individuals with Asperger syndrome, where structural language competence is intact, problems with extended language persist. If we assume that figurative and extended uses of language essentially depend on the perception and processing of more concrete core concepts and phenomena, the commonly observed failure in atypical populations to understand figurative language remains a puzzle. Various accounts have been offered to explain this issue, ranging from linking potential failure directly to overall structural language competence (Norbury, 2005; Brock et al., 2008) to right-hemispheric involvement (Gold and Faust, 2010). We argue that the dissociation between structural language and figurative language competence in autism should be sought in more general cognitive mechanisms and traits in the autistic phenotype (e.g., in terms of weak central coherence, Vulchanova et al., 2012b), as well as failure at on-line semantic integration with increased complexity and diversity of the stimuli (Coulson and Van Petten, 2002). This perspective is even more compelling in light of similar problems in a number of conditions, including both acquired (e.g., Aphasia) and developmental disorders (Williams Syndrome). This dissociation argues against a simple continuity view of language interpretation.
25735789	doi: 10.1002/aur.1470	Relationship Between Surface-Based Brain Morphometric Measures and Intelligence in Autism Spectrum Disorders: Influence of History of Language Delay.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2015			Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of conditions that show abnormalities in the neuroanatomy of multiple brain regions. The variability in the development of intelligence and language among individuals on the autism spectrum has long been acknowledged, but it remains unknown whether these differences impact on the neuropathology of ASD. In this study, we aimed to compare associations between surface-based regional brain measures and general intelligence (IQ) scores in ASD individuals with and without a history of language delay. We included 64 ASD adults of normal intelligence (37 without a history of language delay and 27 with a history of language delay and 80 neurotypicals). Regions with a significant association between verbal and nonverbal IQ and measures of cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and cortical volume were first identified in the combined sample of individuals with ASD and controls. Thicker dorsal frontal and temporal cortices, and thinner lateral orbital frontal and parieto-occipital cortices were associated with greater and lower verbal IQ scores, respectively. Correlations between cortical volume and verbal IQ were observed in similar regions as revealed by the CT analysis. A significant difference between ASD individuals with and without a history of language delay in the association between CT and verbal IQ was evident in the parieto-occipital region. These results indicate that ASD subgroups defined on the basis of differential language trajectories in childhood can have different associations between verbal IQ and brain measures in adulthood despite achieving similar levels of cognitive performance.

Korean journal of pediatrics	2015	Sung Koo Kim	Division of Pediatric Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Hallym University Dongtan Sacred Heart Hospital, Hallym University College of Medicine, Hwaseong, Korea.	In patients with a language developmental delay, it is necessary to make a differential diagnosis for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), specific language impairment, and mental retardation. It is important that pediatricians recognize the signs and symptoms of ASDs, as many patients with language developmental delays are ultimately diagnosed with ASDs. Pediatricians play an important role in the early recognition of ASDs, because they are usually the first point of contact for children with ASDs. A revision of the diagnostic criteria of ASDs was proposed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5) that was released in May 2013. The autism spectrum describes a range of conditions classified as neurodevelopmental disorders in the fifth edition of the DSM. The new diagnostic criteria encompasses previous elements from the diagnosis of autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified. An additional change to the DSM includes synthesizing the section on social and communication deficits into one domain. In ASD patients, the appropriate behavioral therapies and rehabilitation treatments significantly affect the prognosis. Therefore, this makes early diagnosis and treatment very important. In conclusion, pediatricians need to be able to recognize the signs and symptoms of ASDs and be attentive to them in order to make an early diagnosis and provide treatment.

Electronic address: profbittar@precisionhealth.com.au.	The mirror neuron (MN) hypothesis of autism has received considerable attention, but to date has produced inconsistent findings. Using functional MRI, participants with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome were compared to typically developing individuals (n=12 in each group). Participants passively observed hand gestures that included waving, pointing, and grasping. Concerning the MN network, both groups activated similar regions including prefrontal, inferior parietal and superior temporal regions, with the autism group demonstrating significantly greater activation in the dorsal premotor cortex. Concerning other regions, participants with autism demonstrated increased activity in the anterior cingulate and medial frontal gyrus, and reduced activation in calcarine, cuneus, and middle temporal gyrus. These results suggest that during observation of hand gestures, frontal cortex activation is affected in autism, which we suggest may be linked to abnormal functioning of the MN system.
25722757		Judicial Perceptions of Media Portrayals of Offenders with High Functioning Autistic Spectrum Disorders.	International journal of criminology and sociology	2014	Colleen M Berryessa	Stanford University, Center for Biomedical Ethics, 1215A Welch Road Stanford, CA 94305, USA.	In recent years, sensational media reporting focusing on crimes committed by those diagnosed with or thought to have High Functioning Autistic Spectrum Disorders (hfASDs) has caused societal speculation that there is a link between the disorder and violent criminality. No research exists on how and if the judiciary understands and is affected by this coverage. Therefore this study aims to examine how judges perceive and are influenced by media attention surrounding hfASDs and criminality. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 California Superior Court Judges, including questions on media portrayal. Judges perceived general media portrayals of hfASDs in both positive and negative ways. However, almost all judges who had experienced media coverage surrounding hfASDs and criminality identified it as misleading and harmful to public perceptions of the disorder. These findings suggest judges are not exempt from media attention surrounding violence and hfASDs, and they recognize the potential adverse effects of this negative coverage. Although judges' report their opinions are not affected, the results demonstrate that judges are worried that the public and potentially other criminal justice actors are adversely affected and will continue to be moving forward.

"A functional polymorphism (5-HTTLPR) within the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) has been associated with personality dimensions such as neuroticism, with emotional reactivity to negative events, and with an increased risk of affective disorders. More specifically, the short (S) allele of 5-HTTLPR has been linked to increased amygdala activity and has been identified as a risk allele for depressive disorders. Recently, Homberg and Lesch (2011) urged for a conceptual change in the current deficit-oriented connotation of the 5-HTTLPR S-allele and argued that the S-allele could be considered adaptive in certain contexts. They postulated that S-allele carriers show hypervigilant behavior in social situations and should thus show increased social conformity. Therefore, we tested whether 5-HTTLPR modulates the neural correlates of real-life social joint action through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Thirty participants, homozygote for 5-HTTLPR, were measured and analyzed while they were involved in a previously published joint-action paradigm, which reliably leads to an activation of the left parietal cortex. We found that homozygote S-allele carriers showed increased inferior parietal lobe activation, compared to the LL-allele carriers for the contrast ""joint action greater solo action"". Therefore, our results provide evidence for beneficial effects of the S-allele on the neural correlates of social interactions."

Gaze direction provides important information about social attention, and people tend to reflexively orient in the direction others are gazing. Perceiving the gaze of others relies on the integration of multiple social cues, which include perceptual information related to the eyes, gaze direction, head position, and body orientation of others. Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are characterised by social and emotional deficits, including atypical gaze behaviour. The social-emotional deficits may emerge from a reliance on perceptual information involving details and features, at the expense of more holistic processing, which includes the integration of features. While people with ASC are often able to physically compute gaze direction and show intact reflexive orienting to others' gaze, they show deficits in reading mental states from the eyes.

Autism spectrum conditions (autism) affect ~1% of the population and are characterized by deficits in social communication. Oxytocin has been widely reported to affect social-communicative function and its neural underpinnings. Here we report the first evidence that intranasal oxytocin administration improves a core problem that individuals with autism have in using eye contact appropriately in real-world social settings. A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design is used to examine how intranasal administration of 24 IU of oxytocin affects gaze behavior for 32 adult males with autism and 34 controls in a real-time interaction with a researcher. This interactive paradigm bypasses many of the limitations encountered with conventional static or computer-based stimuli. Eye movements are recorded using eye tracking, providing an objective measurement of looking patterns. The measure is shown to be sensitive to the reduced eye contact commonly reported in autism, with the autism group spending less time looking to the eye region of the face than controls. Oxytocin administration selectively enhanced gaze to the eyes in both the autism and control groups (transformed mean eye-fixation difference per second=0.082; 95% CI:0.025-0.14, P=0.006). Within the autism group, oxytocin has the most effect on fixation duration in individuals with impaired levels of eye contact at baseline (Cohen's d=0.86). These findings demonstrate that the potential benefits of oxytocin in autism extend to a real-time interaction, providing evidence of a therapeutic effect in a key aspect of social communication.

Psychological assessment	2015	Mary E Stewart, Carrie Allison, Simon Baron-Cohen, Roger Watson	Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, Cambridge University. Faculty of Health and Social Care, University of Hull. Psychology.	Traits similar to those shown in autism spectrum condition (ASC) are apparent in relatives of individuals with ASC, and in the general population without necessarily meeting diagnostic criteria for an ASC. We assess whether the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), a self-report measure, has hierarchical properties using Mokken scaling. Hierarchical scales allow the presence of a latent trait to be identified by discovering whether and how many specific items form an ordered array along it. Data were collected from 2 groups: (1) people with ASC (n = 449: 240 males, 209 females, M(age) 35.4 years, SD = 12.8) and (2) university students (n = 943: 465 males, 475 females, M(age) = 23.0 years, SD = 8.4). A single Mokken scale was obtained in the data from university students and 3 scales were obtained in the data from people with ASC. The scales all showed moderate Mokken scaling properties with the single scale obtained from university students showing weak invariant item ordering and 2 of the scales from people with ASC showing weak invariant item ordering. The AQ formed reliable Mokken scales. There was a large overlap between the scale from the university student sample and the sample with ASC, with the first scale, relating to social interaction, being almost identical. The present study confirms the utility of the AQ as a single instrument that can dimensionalize autistic traits in both university student and clinical samples of ASC, and confirms that items of the AQ are consistently ordered relative to one another.

Developmental Brain-Behaviour Laboratory, Psychology, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.	Mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported to be involved in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies investigating the possible association between ASD and polymorphism in SLC25A12, which encodes the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier, have yielded inconsistent results. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of such studies to elucidate if and which SLC25A12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with ASD. We searched PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and ERIC databases through September 20th, 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) were aggregated using random effect models. Sensitivity analyses were conducted based on study design (family-based or case-control). Fifteen out of 79 non-duplicate records were retained for qualitative synthesis. We pooled 10 datasets from 9 studies with 2001 families, 735 individuals with ASD and 632 typically developing (TD) individuals for the meta-analysis of rs2292813, as well as 11 datasets from 10 studies with 2016 families, 852 individuals with ASD and 1058 TD individuals for the meta-analysis of rs2056202. We found a statistically significant association between ASD and variant in rs2292813 (OR = 1.190, 95% CI 1.052-1.346, P = 0.006) as well as in rs2056202 (OR = 1.206, 95% CI 1.035-1.405, P = 0.016). Sensitivity analyses including only studies with family-based design demonstrated significant association between ASD and polymorphism in rs2292813 (OR = 1.216, 95% CI 1.075-1.376, P = 0.002) and rs2056202 (OR = 1.267, 95% CI 1.041-1.542, P = 0.018). In contrast, sensitivity analyses including case-control design studies only failed to find a significant association. Further research on the role of SLC25A12 and ASD may pave the way for potential innovative therapeutic interventions.

Expert review of neurotherapeutics	2015	F I Tarazi, Z T Sahli, J Pleskow, S A Mousa		Asperger's syndrome (AS), a behavioral disorder that is related to autism, is associated with abnormal social functioning and repetitive behaviors but not with a decrease in intelligence or linguistic functionality. This article reviews the clinical diagnosis of AS and discusses the comorbid disorders that may be present with AS, as well as the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pharmacotherapies given to AS patients, as reported in preclinical and clinical studies. AS may be present with several comorbid disorders including: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and Tourette's syndrome. The difficulty in distinguishing AS from autism results in treating the comorbid disorder symptoms, rather than treating the symptoms of AS. Accordingly, there is a great need to further understand the psychobiology of AS and its association with other disorders, which should expand the pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic options and improve the quality of life for AS patients.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2015	Sam Fellowes	Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion, County South, Lancaster University, Lancaster, Lancashire, LA1 4YL, UK, m.fellowes1@lancaster.ac.uk.	Kanner opens his pioneering 1943 paper on autism by making a mysterious mention of the year 1938. Recent letters to the editor of this journal have disagreed over a particular interpretation-does 1938 refer to an early paper by Asperger, effectively meaning Kanner plagiarised Asperger? I argue 1938 refers to a paper by Louise Despert. This was not plagiarism but a case of building on Despert's ideas. Additionally, I suggest his motives for not mentioning her by name were not dishonourable.
25610383	pii: 991	Emotional language processing in autism spectrum disorders: a systematic review.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2014	Alina Lartseva, Ton Dijkstra, Jan K Buitelaar	Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Centre for Neuroscience, Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Netherlands. Donders Centre for Cognition, Radboud University Nijmegen Nijmegen, Netherlands. Department of Cognitive Neuroscience, Donders Centre for Neuroscience, Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Netherlands ; International Max Planck Research School for Language Sciences, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics Nijmegen, Netherlands.	In his first description of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), Kanner emphasized emotional impairments by characterizing children with ASD as indifferent to other people, self-absorbed, emotionally cold, distanced, and retracted. Thereafter, emotional impairments became regarded as part of the social impairments of ASD, and research mostly focused on understanding how individuals with ASD recognize visual expressions of emotions from faces and body postures. However, it still remains unclear how emotions are processed outside of the visual domain. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by focusing on impairments of emotional language processing in ASD. We systematically searched PubMed for papers published between 1990 and 2013 using standardized search terms. Studies show that people with ASD are able to correctly classify emotional language stimuli as emotionally positive or negative. However, processing of emotional language stimuli in ASD is associated with atypical patterns of attention and memory performance, as well as abnormal physiological and neural activity. Particularly, younger children with ASD have difficulties in acquiring and developing emotional concepts, and avoid using these in discourse. These emotional language impairments were not consistently associated with age, IQ, or level of development of language skills. We discuss how emotional language impairments fit with existing cognitive theories of ASD, such as central coherence, executive dysfunction, and weak Theory of Mind. We conclude that emotional impairments in ASD may be broader than just a mere consequence of social impairments, and should receive more attention in future research.

From the Department of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Odense, Research Unit (University function), Mental Health Services in Region of Southern Denmark, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Southern Denmark.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia are separate disorders, but there is evidence of conversion or comorbid overlap. The objective of this paper was to explore whether deficits in sensory gating, as seen in some schizophrenia patients, can also be found in a group of ASD children compared to neurotypically developed children. An additional aim was to investigate the possibility of subdividing our ASD sample based on these gating deficits. In a case-control design, we assessed gating of the P50 and N100 amplitude in 31 ASD children and 39 healthy matched controls (8-12 years) and screened for differences between groups and within the ASD group. We did not find disturbances in auditory P50 and N100 filtering in the group of ASD children as a whole, nor did we find abnormal P50 and N100 amplitudes. However, the P50 amplitude to the conditioning stimulus was significantly reduced in the Asperger subgroup compared to healthy controls. In contrast to what is usually reported for patients with schizophrenia, we found no evidence for sensory gating deficits in our group of ASD children taken as a whole. However, reduced P50 amplitude to conditioning stimuli was found in the Asperger group, which is similar to what has been described in some studies in schizophrenia patients. There was a positive correlation between the P50 amplitude of the conditioning stimuli and anxiety score in the pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified group, which indicates a relation between anxiety and sensory registration in this group.

Asperger's Syndrome (AS) is an autism spectrum disorder that is characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. Difficulties with respect to pragmatic speech, reading emotional and social cues, differentiating between fact and fiction, and taking into account the influence of context on a statement are commonly described features. However, hitherto established questionnaires did not focus on these symptoms.

The relationship between sex/gender differences and autism has attracted a variety of research ranging from clinical and neurobiological to etiological, stimulated by the male bias in autism prevalence. Findings are complex and do not always relate to each other in a straightforward manner. Distinct but interlinked questions on the relationship between sex/gender differences and autism remain underaddressed. To better understand the implications from existing research and to help design future studies, we propose a 4-level conceptual framework to clarify the embedded themes.

Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet	2014	Tippawan Hansakunachai, Rawiwan Roongpraiwan, Tasnawat Sombuntham, Pornprot Limprasert, Nichara Ruangdaraganon		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder in children. The clinical spectrum of ASD includes autism, childhood disintegrative disorder Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Although the DSM-IVcriteria are well acceptedforASD diagnosis, there are some known limitations for clinicians. The most important issue is lack'ofspecific age-appropriate items in each domain. Thus, the DSM-IVneeds some modifications in order to be appropriate for clinical use.

Department of Psychology, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.	We investigated metacognition of agency in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS) using a computer task in which participants moved the mouse to get the cursor to touch the downward moving X's and avoid the O's. They were then asked to make judgments of performance and judgments of agency. Objective control was either undistorted, or distorted by adding turbulence (i.e., random noise) or a time Lag between the mouse and cursor movements. Participants with HFA/AS used sensorimotor cues available in the turbulence and lag conditions to a lesser extent than control participants in making their judgments of agency. Furthermore, the failure to use these internal diagnostic cues to their own agency was correlated with decrements in a theory of mind task. These findings suggest that a reduced sensitivity to veridical internal cues about the sense of agency is related to mentalizing impairments in autism.

Electronic address: kstrifert@uab.edu.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of developmental disabilities that include full syndrome autism, Asperger's syndrome, and other pervasive developmental disorders. The identified prevalence of ASD has increased in a short time period across multiple studies causing some to conclude that it has reached epidemic proportions in the U.S. Many possible explanations for the rise in numbers of individuals diagnosed with ASD have been offered and yet, causes and contributing factors for ASD are inadequately understood. Current evidence suggests that both genetics and environment play a part in causing ASD. One possible risk factor for the increase in prevalence has been profoundly overlooked in the existing biomedical and epidemiologic literature. As the prevalence of ASD has risen in the last sixty years, so has the prevalence of the usage of the oral contraceptives and other modern hormonal delivery methods. In 1960 about one million American women were using oral contraceptives, today close to 11 million women in the U.S. use oral contraceptives. Eighty-two percent of sexually active women in the U.S. have used oral contraceptives at some point during their reproductive years. Thus, the growth in use of progesterone/estrogen-based contraceptives in the United State has reached near-ubiquitous levels among women in the child-bearing age range. The suppression of ovulation produced by estrogen-progesterone is an indisputable abnormality. It is logical to consider the outcome of the ovum that would have been normally released from the ovary during ovulation. To date there is no comprehensive research into the potential neurodevelopmental effects of oral contraceptive use on progeny. The issue has been only sparsely considered in the biomedical literature. This article hypothesizes that the compounds, estrogen and progesterone, used in oral contraceptives modify the condition of the oocyte and give rise to a potent risk factor that helps explain the recent increase in the prevalence of ASD's. This hypothesis does not propose to delineate the cause of autism. Rather, it attempts to explain the recent dramatic increase in prevalence and point the way for further study that will lead to causal examination.

The category of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) without intellectual disability (including Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism) has increased steadily among individuals since the 1980s. Although some symptoms may decrease with age, functional disability persists and is largely related to abnormalities in social interaction. Within the framework of PDD without intellectual disability, improving social skills appears to be a primary target for intervention programs. Despite a recent increase in the number of studies on this topic, few validated programs are yet available for clinical settings.

Journal of abnormal psychology	2015	Yuhong V Jiang, Bryce E Palm, Michaela C DeBolt, Yi Shuen Goh	Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota.	Domain-general theories of autism rest on evidence that the disorder impacts not only social communication skills but also nonsocial functions such as memory. Yet recognition memory deficits have been inconsistently documented, especially for stimuli other than faces and sentences. Here we tested school-age children with high-functioning autism (ASD) and IQ, and age-matched comparison children on a visual long-term memory task involving more than 100 photographs of objects, faces, cats, houses, and abstract stimuli. Children viewed each photograph for 2 s. After a 10-min filled delay, we assessed recognition memory for object category as well as for specific exemplars. Data supported the presence of a high-capacity and high-precision visual memory in children with ASD. Both category memory and exemplar memory accuracies were above 90% for categories for which a single exemplar had been encoded. When more exemplars per category were encoded, category memory improved, but exemplar memory declined. An exception was face memory, which remained highly accurate even after many faces had been encoded. Our study provided no evidence that visual memory in general, and face memory in particular, is impaired in children with ASD.

European child & adolescent psychiatry	2015	Bibbi Hagberg, Eva Billstedt, Agneta Nydén, Christopher Gillberg		"A specific overlap between Asperger syndrome (AS) and nonverbal learning difficulties (NLD) has been proposed, based on the observation that, as a group, people with AS tend to have significantly higher verbal IQ (VIQ) than performance IQ (PIQ), one of the core features of NLD. The primary aim was to assess the longer term outcome of NLD--broken down into persistent and transient forms. The present study of 68 individuals was performed in the context of a larger prospective longitudinal study to late adolescence/early adult life of 100 boys with AS. Using self- and parent-report measures, we studied the longer term outcome of the NLD (defined as VIQ > PIQ by 15 points) as regards social communication, repetitive behaviour, attention, and executive function (EF) was studied. Three subgroups were identified: (1) Persistent NLD (P-NLD), (2) Childhood ""only"" NLD (CO-NLD) and (3) Never NLD (NO-NLD). The P-NLD group had the worst outcome overall. The CO-NLD group had better reported EF scores than the two other AS subgroups. There were no differences between the subgroups regarding social communication, repetitive behaviour, or attentional skills. Low PIQ increased the risk of ADHD symptoms. In the context of AS in males, P-NLD carries a relatively poor outcome, particularly with regard to self-reported EF. However, CO-NLD appears to entail a significantly better outcome. The results underscore the importance of analysing the cognitive profile both at diagnosis and after several years, so as to be able to formulate a realistic prognosis."

In this study, a comparative analysis of intelligence level and autistic traits was conducted between children with PWS (n = 30; 18 males, 12 females; age = 10.6 ± 2.8 years) and those with Asperger disorder (AD; n = 31; 24 males, 7 females; age = 10.5 ± 3.1 years). The children were compared by age group: lower elementary school age (6-8 years), upper elementary school age (9-12 years), and middle school age (13-15 years). As results, the intelligence levels of children with PWS were significantly lower than those with AD across all age groups. Autistic traits, assessed using the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS), revealed that among elementary school age children, those with PWS had less prominent autistic traits than those with AD, however, among middle school age children, those with PWS and AD showed similar prominence. An analysis of the PARS subscale scores by age group showed that while the profiles of autistic traits for children with PWS differed from those of children with AD at elementary school age, the profiles showed no significant differences between the groups at middle school age. The findings suggest that autistic traits in PWS become gradually more prominent with increasing of age and that these autistic traits differ in their fundamental nature from those observed in AD.
25381114	doi: 10.1007/s00787-014-0643-7	Parental migration and Asperger's syndrome.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2015	Venla Lehti, Keely Cheslack-Postava, Mika Gissler, Susanna Hinkka-Yli-Salomäki, Alan S Brown, Andre Sourander		Parental immigration has been suggested as a possible risk factor for autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but findings have been inconsistent. Very few studies have focused specifically on Asperger's syndrome. The aim of this study was to examine the association between maternal and paternal immigration and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome in offspring. The study was a nested case-control study based on a national birth cohort in Finland. Children born in 1987-2005 and diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome by the year 2007 were identified from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register (N = 1,783). Four matched controls for each case were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register (N = 7,106). Information on maternal and paternal country of birth and mother tongue was collected from the Finnish Central Population Register. The study showed that children whose parents are both immigrants have a significantly lower likelihood of being diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome than those with two Finnish parents [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.4]. No significant associations were found between having only one immigrant parent and the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. A regional analysis showed a significantly decreased likelihood of the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome in children whose mother (aOR 0.1, 95 % CI 0.01-0.5) or father (aOR 0.2, 95 % CI 0.05-0.5) was born in Sub-Saharan Africa. The findings may help in identifying risk factors for different ASD subtypes. On the other hand, they might reflect service use of immigrant families in Finland.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2014	Ben Alderson-Day	Science Laboratories, Psychology Department, Durham University, Durham, UK.	Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) adopt less efficient strategies than typically developing (TD) peers on the Twenty Questions Task (TQT), a measure of verbal problem-solving skills. Although problems with the TQT are typically associated with executive dysfunction, they have also been reported in children who are deaf, suggesting a role for atypical language development. To test the contribution of language history to ASD problem solving, TQT performance was compared in children with high-functioning autism (HFA), children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and TD children. The HFA group used significantly less efficient strategies than both AS and TD children. No group differences were evident on tests of question understanding, planning or verbal fluency. Potential explanations for differences in verbal problem-solving skill are discussed with reference to the development of inner speech and use of visual strategies in ASD.

ASD are defined by two basic psychopathological dimensions: communication disturbances and stereotyped behaviors, and the diagnosis is complemented with the assessment of language development and intellectual level. In successive epidemiological studies conducted in 21 century the prevalence of ASD has been rising, and currently is estimated at 1% in general population. The lifetime psychiatric comorbidity is observed in majority of patients. The most common coexisting diagnoses comprise disorders ofanxiety-affective spectrum, and in about 1/3 of patients attention deficit/ hyperactivity disorders could be diagnosed. Prodromal symptoms of ASD may emerge before 12 months of life, however reliability of diagnosis at such an early age is poor. Several screening instruments, based on the parental and/or healthcare professional assessments may be helpful in ASD detection. However, structured interviews and observation schedules remain the gold standard of diagnosis.

25296511		[Gender dysphoria in adolescents: difficulties in treatment].	Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie	2014	Bernd Meyenburg		In many children and adolescents with gender dysphoria only minor or no psychopathology is found. 43% of patients seen in the Frankfurt University Gender Identity Clinic for children and adolescents suffer from major psychopathology. To demonstrate difficulties in treatment of these patients courses of treatment in four such patients are presented. In two natal females major psychopathology made decision for reassignment very difficult. Two natal males were in addition not able to follow recommended treatment steps, in these patients diagnostic doubts arose.

Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society	2014	Akira Iwanami, Yuka Okajima, Haruhisa Ota, Masayuki Tani, Takashi Yamada, Bun Yamagata, Ryuichiro Hashimoto, Chieko Kanai, Osamu Takashio, Atsuko Inamoto, Taisei Ono, Yukiko Takayama, Nobumasa Kato		In the present study, we investigated auditory event-related potentials in adults with Asperger disorder and normal controls using an auditory oddball task and a novelty oddball task. Task performance and the latencies of P300 evoked by both target and novel stimuli in the two tasks did not differ between the two groups. Analysis of variance revealed that there was a significant interaction effect between group and electrode site on the mean amplitude of the P300 evoked by novel stimuli, which indicated that there was an altered distribution of the P300 in persons with Asperger disorder. In contrast, there was no significant interaction effect on the mean P300 amplitude elicited by target stimuli. Considering that P300 comprises two main subcomponents, frontal-central-dominant P3a and parietal-dominant P3b, our results suggested that persons with Asperger disorder have enhanced amplitude of P3a, which indicated activated prefrontal function in this task.

Praxis	2014	Helene Haker	Translational Neuromodeling Unit, Institut für Biomedizinische Technik, Universität Zürich und ETH Zürich.	The Asperger Syndrome is - in contrast to early childhood autism - a disorder at the lighter end of the autism spectrum. Although first described in 1943, it was included in the ICD-10 not before 1992. The knowledge about this lighter autistic disorder spread only slowly. The increasing prevalence rates can be explained by the increased knowledge about this disorder and the growing clinical experience. In contrast to the public that gives repeated medial attention to it, and to would-be affected who seem to see an attractive excuse for social problems in an Asperger diagnosis, many psychiatrists appear cautious to state a diagnosis with which they are not familiar and which is discredited as a fashionable diagnosis.

Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are a group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by impairments in communication and social interaction, alongside unusually repetitive behaviors and narrow interests. ASC are highly heritable and have complex patterns of inheritance where multiple genes are involved, alongside environmental and epigenetic factors. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a subgroup of these conditions, where there is no history of language or cognitive delay. Animal models suggest a role for oxytocin (OXT) and oxytocin receptor (OXTR) genes in social-emotional behaviors, and several studies indicate that the oxytocin/oxytocin receptor system is altered in individuals with ASC. Previous studies have reported associations between genetic variations in the OXTR gene and ASC.

Lakartidningen	2014	Susanne Bejerot, Viviann Nordin	Karolinska institutet - Stockholm, Sweden Karolinska institutet - Stockholm, Sweden. Karolinska Institutet - Clinical Neuroscience Stockholm, Sweden Karolinska Institutet - Clinical Neuroscience Stockholm, Sweden.	Autism spectrum disorder describes a behaviourally defined impairment in social interaction and communication, along with the presence of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Although the etiology is mostly unknown, it is evident that biological factors affect the brain and result in the autistic clinical presentation. Assessment for diagnosing autism spectrum disorder should be comprehensive in order to cover all sorts of problems related to the disorder. Knowledge and experience from working with neurological and psychiatric disorders are a prerequisite for quality in the examination. Up to now, there is no cure for autism spectrum disorder, but support and adaptations in education are nevertheless important for obtaining sufficient life quality for the patients and the family.

There is a need for a better understanding of syntax in ASD and its relation to, or dissociation from, nonverbal abilities.

Social cognition-the basis of all communicative and otherwise interpersonal relationships-is embedded in specific contextual circumstances which shape intrinsic meanings. This domain is compromised in the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including Asperger's syndrome (AS) (DSM-V). However, the few available reports of social cognition skills in adults with AS have largely neglected the effects of contextual factors. Moreover, previous studies on this population have also failed to simultaneously (a) assess multiple social cognition domains, (b) examine executive functions, (c) follow strict sample selection criteria, and (d) acknowledge the cognitive heterogeneity typical of the disorder. The study presently reviewed (Baez et al., 2012), addressed all these aspects in order to establish the basis of social cognition deficits in adult AS patients. Specifically, we assessed the performance of AS adults in multiple social cognition tasks with different context-processing requirements. The results suggest that social cognition deficits in AS imply a reduced ability to implicitly encode and integrate contextual cues needed to access social meaning. Nevertheless, the patients' performance was normal when explicit social information was presented or when the situation could be navigated with abstract rules. Here, we review the results of our study and other relevant data, and discuss their implications for the diagnosis and treatment of AS and other neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, frontotemporal dementia). Finally, we analyze previous results in the light of a current neurocognitive model of social-context processing.

International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology	2015	Mark T Palermo, Stefan Bogaerts	Tilburg University, The Netherlands Forensic Psychiatric Centre de Kijvelanden, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA The Law and Behavior Foundation, Amsterdam, The Netherlands mt.palermo@lawandbehavior.org.	Posthumous diagnoses are not uncommonly given to notorious public and historical figures by applying retrospectively, and typically in the absence of the individual being diagnosed, contemporary diagnostic criteria. Although this may be relatively easy and free of consequences when it concerns clear-cut medical conditions, it may have unintended repercussions in the case of psychiatric disorders by creating myths and perpetuating stigma. The case of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is a typical example where a somewhat facile and almost syllogistic application of perhaps over-inclusive criteria may have contributed to the legend of solitary murderers as possibly suffering from an autism spectrum condition. Although there may be an understandable human need to explain abominable and heinous behaviors, the lack of the possibility to verify a diagnostic theory and the ill-advised attempt to make a diagnosis fit may de facto be the basis of prejudice and profiling that do not correspond to clinical reality. Although there is no doubt that the brain is the organ of behavior, the authors caution against a budding neo-Lombrosian approach to crime and criminality and against the all too common use of widely differing terms in the study of deviance, such as crime, delinquency, and aggression, the operational use of which, often used interchangeably even in association studies, often erroneously leads to further confusion.

Bipolar disorder type I (BP-I) belongs to a spectrum of affective disorders that are expressed in many different ways and therefore can be difficult to distinguish from other conditions, especially unipolar depression, schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia (SZ), but also anxiety and personality disorders. Since early diagnosis and treatment have shown to improve the long-term prognosis, complementary specific biomarkers are of great value. The auditory brainstem response (ABR) has previously been applied successfully to identify specific abnormal ABR patterns in SZ and Asperger syndrome.

P. Bradley Hospital, East Providence, RI USA ; Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, East Providence, RI USA.	The developmental pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is currently not fully understood. However, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the behavioral phenotype may result from dysfunctional inhibitory control over excitatory synaptic plasticity. Consistent with this claim, previous studies indicate that adults with Asperger's Syndrome show an abnormally extended modulation of corticospinal excitability following a train of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). As ASD is a developmental disorder, the current study aimed to explore the effect of development on the duration of modulation of corticospinal excitability in children and adolescents with ASD. Additionally, as the application of rTMS to the understanding and treatment of pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders is an emerging field, this study further sought to provide evidence for the safety and tolerability of rTMS in children and adolescents with ASD. Corticospinal excitability was measured by applying single pulses of TMS to the primary motor cortex both before and following a 40 s train of continuous theta burst stimulation. 19 high-functioning males ages 9-18 with ASD participated in this study. Results from this study reveal a positive linear relationship between age and duration of modulation of rTMS after-effects. Specifically we found that the older participants had a longer lasting response. Furthermore, though the specific protocol employed typically suppresses corticospinal excitability in adults, more than one third of our sample had a paradoxical facilitatory response to the stimulation. Results support the safety and tolerability of rTMS in pediatric clinical populations. Data also support published theories implicating aberrant plasticity and GABAergic dysfunction in this population.

Simpson University, Redding, CA, USA. The Institute of Chronic Illnesses, Inc, Silver Spring, MD, USA. CoMeD, Inc, Silver Spring, MD, USA.	It was recently postulated that because increased genetic load and increased parental age are both purportedly associated with the risk to develop an autism spectrum disorder, there must be a linkage between increasing genetic load and increasing parental age in autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis. The present study examined the hypothesis that if increased genetic load from increasing paternal age is important to autism spectrum disorder pathogenesis, then there should be a significant relationship between increasing parental age and increasing autism spectrum disorder phenotypic severity. Outpatient clinical records were retrospectively examined to identify a consecutive cohort of subjects diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (n = 351). Increasing autism spectrum disorder phenotypic severity was found not to be associated with increasing maternal/paternal age. The present study failed to support the hypothesis that increasing parental age was associated with increasing autism spectrum disorder phenotypic severity, but future studies should examine the relationship between genetic mutations in subjects diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder and increasing parental age.

There is evidence emerging from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) research that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with greater impairment in the left hemisphere. Although this has been quantified with volumetric region of interest analyses, it has yet to be tested with white matter integrity analysis. In the present study, tract based spatial statistics was used to contrast white matter integrity of 12 participants with high-functioning autism or Aspergers syndrome (HFA/AS) with 12 typically developing individuals. Fractional Anisotropy (FA) was examined, in addition to axial, radial and mean diffusivity (AD, RD and MD). In the left hemisphere, participants with HFA/AS demonstrated significantly reduced FA in predominantly thalamic and fronto-parietal pathways and increased RD. Symmetry analyses confirmed that in the HFA/AS group, WM disturbance was significantly greater in the left compared to right hemisphere. These findings contribute to a growing body of literature suggestive of reduced FA in ASD, and provide preliminary evidence for RD impairments in the left hemisphere.

The phenotype of autism involves heterogeneous adaptive traits (strengths vs. disabilities), different domains of alterations (social vs. non-social), and various associated genetic conditions (syndromic vs. nonsyndromic autism). Three observations suggest that alterations in experience-dependent plasticity are an etiological factor in autism: (1) the main cognitive domains enhanced in autism are controlled by the most plastic cortical brain regions, the multimodal association cortices; (2) autism and sensory deprivation share several features of cortical and functional reorganization; and (3) genetic mutations and/or environmental insults involved in autism all appear to affect developmental synaptic plasticity, and mostly lead to its upregulation. We present the Trigger-Threshold-Target (TTT) model of autism to organize these findings. In this model, genetic mutations trigger brain reorganization in individuals with a low plasticity threshold, mostly within regions sensitive to cortical reallocations. These changes account for the cognitive enhancements and reduced social expertise associated with autism. Enhanced but normal plasticity may underlie non-syndromic autism, whereas syndromic autism may occur when a triggering mutation or event produces an altered plastic reaction, also resulting in intellectual disability and dysmorphism in addition to autism. Differences in the target of brain reorganization (perceptual vs. language regions) account for the main autistic subgroups. In light of this model, future research should investigate how individual and sex-related differences in synaptic/regional brain plasticity influence the occurrence of autism.

This study examined, for the first time, the impact of implementation intentions on prospective memory (PM) performance in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and further explored the role of retrospective memory for PM in ASD. PM was assessed with Virtual Week, a computerized game simulating upcoming everyday-life tasks. Twenty-seven adults with ASD and 27 age- and ability-matched controls were included. Half of the participants were instructed to form implementation intentions (i.e., encoding PM tasks in form of if-then statements), while the rest received simple PM instructions. Results provide first tentative evidence for beneficial effects of implementation intentions and PM tasks with low demands on retrospective memory for adults with ASD's PM. Overall, results point to the importance of planning and retrospective memory for successful prospective remembering in ASD.

Multiple studies have tried to establish the distinctive profile of individuals with Asperger's syndrome (AS). However, recent reports suggest that adults with AS feature heterogeneous cognitive profiles. The present study explores inter-individual variability in children with AS through group comparison and multiple case series analysis. All participants completed an extended battery including measures of fluid and crystallized intelligence, executive functions, theory of mind, and classical neuropsychological tests. Significant group differences were found in theory of mind and other domains related to global information processing. However, the AS group showed high inter-individual variability (both sub- and supra-normal performance) on most cognitive tasks. Furthermore, high fluid intelligence correlated with less general cognitive impairment, high cognitive flexibility, and speed of motor processing. In light of these findings, we propose that children with AS are characterized by a distinct, uneven pattern of cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

Although it is largely demonstrated that Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are characterized by executive dysfunctions, little is known about the fine-grained levels of this impairment. Here, we investigated the hierarchical architecture of control modules in autism using an experimental paradigm based upon a multistage model of executive functions. This model postulates that executive functions are hierarchically organized as a cascade of three different control processes, which are implemented according to information conveyed by sensory signals (sensory control), the immediate perceptual context (contextual control), and the temporal episode in which stimuli occur (episodic control). Sixteen high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS) and sixteen matched comparison participants took part in two distinct visuo-motor association experiments designed to separately vary the demands of sensory and episodic controls (first experiment) and contextual and episodic controls (second experiment). Participants with HFA/AS demonstrated no significant differences in performances with comparison participants when they had to control sensory or contextual information. However, they showed decreased accuracy when having to control information related to episodic signals. Remarkably, performances in episodic control were associated to the autism spectrum quotient in both groups, suggesting that this episodic control impairment might be at the core of ASDs. Those results plead for a specific, rather than generalised, deficit in executive functions in autism. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the impaired cognitive processes that are unique to autism and warrants confirmation using other models of executive functions.

International journal of psychiatry in medicine	2014	Katsunaka Mikami, Yuichi Onishi, Hideo Matsumoto	Tokai University School of Medicine, Japan.	Although the suicide risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been suggested to be higher than previously recognized, there are few case reports focusing on the process for preventing suicide reattempts. We reported that a 17-year-old male who had attempted suicide by jumping was admitted to our emergency department and hospitalized for lumbar spine fracture. In addition to the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, he was diagnosed as ASD according to his life history. This article presents the characteristics of the suicidal behaviors and the process for preventing a suicide reattempt associated with an adolescent with ASD who attempted suicide.

Perspectives on psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science	2013	Uta Frith	Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, and Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, University of Aarhus.	AUTISM AND DYSLEXIA ARE WRONGLY CLASSIFIED AS CHILDHOOD DISORDERS: They are lifelong and therefore have to be studied in adults as well as in children. Individual variability is enormous, and, as a result, behavioral diagnosis remains problematic. The study of the underlying cognitive abilities in autism and dyslexia has acted as a gateway for the emergence of developmental cognitive neuroscience.

Department of Dental Medicine, Division of Pediatric Dentistry, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Northern Stockholm Psychiatry Clinic, St Göran Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.	Despite average intellectual capacity, autistic traits may complicate performance in many everyday situations, thus leading to stress. This study focuses on stress in everyday life in intellectually able adults with autism spectrum disorders. In total, 53 adults (25 with autism spectrum disorder and 28 typical adults from the general population) completed the Perceived Stress Scale. Autistic traits were assessed using the Autism Spectrum Quotient. Adults with autism spectrum disorder reported significantly higher subjective stress and poorer ability to cope with stress in everyday life, as compared to typical adults. Autistic traits were associated with both subjective stress/distress and coping in this cross-sectional series. The long-term consequences of chronic stress in everyday life, as well as treatment intervention focusing on stress and coping, should be addressed in future research as well as in the clinical management of intellectually able adults with autism spectrum disorder.
25072016		Autism Spectrum Disorder: Defining Dimensions and Subgroups.	Current developmental disorders reports	2014	Opal Ousley, Tracy Cermak	Marcus Autism Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, 1920 Briarcliff Road, Atlanta, GA 30329, USA. Emory Autism Center, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Emory University School of Medicine, 1551 Shoup Court, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental disorder associated with the presence of social-communication deficits and restricted and repetitive behaviors. In the latest conceptualization of ASD, these two behavioral dimensions represent the core defining features of ASD, whereas associated dimensions, such as intellectual and language ability, provide a means for describing the ASD heterogeneity. In addition, the characterization of ASD subgroups, defined by the presence of known medical, genetic, or other psychiatric disorders, furthers our understanding of ASD heterogeneity. This paper reviews the history of autism, describes its core defining features, and provides an overview of the clinically and etiologically relevant subgroups that add to the complexity of this condition.
25071534	pii: 511	Rigidity, chaos and integration: hemispheric interaction and individual differences in metaphor comprehension.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2014	Miriam Faust, Yoed N Kenett	The Leslie and Susan Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel. The Leslie and Susan Gonda (Goldschmied) Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel ; Department of Psychology, Bar-Ilan University Ramat-Gan, Israel.	Neurotypical individuals cope flexibly with the full range of semantic relations expressed in human language, including metaphoric relations. This impressive semantic ability may be associated with distinct and flexible patterns of hemispheric interaction, including higher right hemisphere (RH) involvement for processing novel metaphors. However, this ability may be impaired in specific clinical conditions, such as Asperger syndrome (AS) and schizophrenia. The impaired semantic processing is accompanied by different patterns of hemispheric interaction during semantic processing, showing either reduced (in Asperger syndrome) or excessive (in schizophrenia) RH involvement. This paper interprets these individual differences using the terms Rigidity, Chaos and Integration, which describe patterns of semantic memory network states that either lead to semantic well-being or are disruptive of it. We argue that these semantic network states lie on a rigidity-chaos semantic continuum. We define these terms via network science terminology and provide network, cognitive and neural evidence to support our claim. This continuum includes left hemisphere (LH) hyper-rigid semantic memory state on one end (e.g., in persons with AS), and RH chaotic and over-flexible semantic memory state on the other end (e.g., in persons with schizophrenia). In between these two extremes lie different states of semantic memory structure which are related to individual differences in semantic creativity. We suggest that efficient semantic processing is achieved by semantic integration, a balance between semantic rigidity and semantic chaos. Such integration is achieved via intra-hemispheric communication. However, impairments to this well-balanced and integrated pattern of hemispheric interaction, e.g., when one hemisphere dominates the other, may lead to either semantic rigidity or semantic chaos, moving away from semantic integration and thus impairing the processing of metaphoric language.

"Sex differences have been reported in autistic traits and systemizing (male advantage), and empathizing (female advantage) among typically developing individuals. In individuals with autism, these cognitive-behavioural profiles correspond to predictions from the ""extreme male brain"" (EMB) theory of autism (extreme scores on autistic traits and systemizing, below average on empathizing). Sex differences within autism, however, have been under-investigated. Here we show in 811 adults (454 females) with autism and 3,906 age-matched typical control adults (2,562 females) who completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R), and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), that typical females on average scored higher on the EQ, typical males scored higher on the SQ-R and AQ, and both males and females with autism showed a shift toward the extreme of the ""male profile"" on these measures and in the distribution of ""brain types"" (the discrepancy between standardized EQ and SQ-R scores). Further, normative sex differences are attenuated but not abolished in adults with autism. The findings provide strong support for the EMB theory of autism, and highlight differences between males and females with autism."

Department of Psychiatry, Charité University Medical School Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Eschenallee 3, 14050, Berlin, Germany.	Differentiating autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) without accompanying intellectual impairment from personality disorders is often challenging. Identifying personality traits and personality pathology specific to ASD might facilitate diagnostic procedure. We recruited a sample of 59 adults with ASD without accompanying intellectual impairment, 62 individuals with narcissistic personality disorder, 80 individuals with borderline personality disorder, and 106 nonclinical controls. Personality traits, measured with the neo-personality inventory-revised (NEO-PI-R), and personality pathology, measured with the dimensional assessment of personality pathology (DAPP-BQ), were assessed. Personality traits and personality pathology specific to ASD could be identified. ASD individuals scored significantly lower on the NEO-PI-R scales extraversion and openness to experience and significantly higher on the DAPP-BQ scales inhibitedness and compulsivity relative to all other groups. Diagnostic implications are discussed.

Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are rare pediatric malignancies characterized by clinically aggressive lesions that typically show loss of SMARCB1 expression. We herein describe a case of a malignant rhabdoid tumor of the bladder in a 14-year-old male with an autism spectrum disorder and a de novo 3 Mb germline deletion in chromosome band 22q11.2 that included the SMARCB1 gene. The malignancy developed in the setting of chronic hematuria (>2 years) following the occurrence of two other lesions: a central nervous system ganglioglioma and an intraoral dermoid cyst. MRTs of the bladder are exceedingly rare, and this patient is the oldest child reported with this tumor to date. This case adds to the growing body of literature regarding the recently described, phenotypically diverse, distal 22q11.2 syndrome. Furthermore, this is the first reported case in which an MRT of the bladder appears to have developed from a pre-existing bladder lesion. Finally, this case further supports a rhabdoid tumorigenesis model in which heterozygous loss of SMARCB1 predisposes to initial tumor formation with intact SMARCB1 expression, with subsequent inactivation of the other SMARCB1 allele, which results in transformation into more malignant lesions.

"Impairments in emotional processing in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) can be characterised by failure to generate and recognize self-reflective, cognitive-based emotions, such as pride, embarrassment and shame. Among this type of emotions, regret and disappointment, as well as their positive counterparts, result from a counterfactual comparison, that is the comparison between an actual value (""what is"") and a fictive value (""what might have been""). However, while disappointment is experienced when the obtained outcome is worse than the expected outcome that might have occurred from the same choice, regret occurs when one experiences an outcome that is worse than the outcome of foregone choices. By manipulating a simple gambling task, we examined subjective reports on the intensity of negative and positive emotions in a group of adults with High-Functioning Autism or Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS), and a control group matched for age, gender and educational level. Participants were asked to choose between two lotteries with different levels of risk under two conditions of outcome feedback: (i) Partial, in which only the outcome of the chosen lottery was visible, (ii) Complete, in which the outcomes of the two lotteries were simultaneously visible. By comparing partial and complete conditions, we aimed to investigate the differential effect between disappointment and regret, as well as between their positive counterparts. Relative to the control participants (CP), the group with HFA/AS reported reduced regret and no difference between regret and disappointment, along with a preserved ability to use counterfactual thinking and similar choice behaviour. Difficulties to distinguish the feeling of regret in participants with HFA/AS can be explained by diminished emotional awareness, likely associated with an abnormal fronto-limbic connectivity."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	E M A Blijd-Hoogewys, M L Bezemer, P L C van Geert		The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF) screens for executive function deficits in 5- to 18-year-olds. Data of three autism subgroups, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria (N = 35 Autistic Disorder, N = 27 Asperger's Disorder and N = 65 PDD-NOS), were analyzed. The total group has elevated scores on almost all BRIEF scales. The Shift scale is clinically elevated, reflecting a deficit in cognitive flexibility. The BRIEF scales are not found to discriminate among the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) subgroups. The relation between BRIEF and IQ is complex. Possible influencing factors are discussed. Finally, it is recommended to omit the Negativity scale as a validity index in children with ASD and to consider a high score on this index as a unique characteristic of their BRIEF profile, reflecting rigidity problems.

Department for Child & Adolescent Psychiatry & Psychotherapy, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Hauptstraße 8, 79104 Freiburg, Germany.	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly being recognized as an important issue in adult psychiatry and psychotherapy. High intelligence indicates overall good brain functioning and might thus present a particularly good opportunity to study possible cerebral correlates of core autistic features in terms of impaired social cognition, communication skills, the need for routines, and circumscribed interests. Anatomical MRI data sets for 30 highly intelligent patients with high-functioning autism and 30 pairwise-matched control subjects were acquired and analyzed with voxel-based morphometry. The gray matter volume of the pairwise-matched patients and the controls did not differ significantly. When correcting for total brain volume influences, the patients with ASD exhibited smaller left superior frontal volumes on a trend level. Heterogeneous volumetric findings in earlier studies might partly be explained by study samples biased by a high inclusion rate of secondary forms of ASD, which often go along with neuronal abnormalities. Including only patients with high IQ scores might have decreased the influence of secondary forms of ASD and might explain the absence of significant volumetric differences between the patients and the controls in this study.

PloS one	2014	Timo Lorenz, Kathrin Heinitz	Department of Psychology, Freie Universität Berlin, Berlin, Germany.	Rooted in the neurodiversity approach, this study provides an overview of the strengths and interests of individuals with Asperger's Syndrome. We interviewed 136 individuals with Asperger's Syndrome and 155 neurotypical individuals via an online survey with regards to (a) demography, (b) occupational strengths, (c) general self-efficacy, (d) occupational self-efficacy, and (e) the job interest profile according to Holland. The vocational and educational fields of the individuals with Asperger's in the sample are more diverse than and surpass those classical fields stated in research and biographical literature. The comparison of both groups in cross-tables showed that the indicated strengths differ in several areas (ΦCramer = .02-.47), which means that a specific strength profile can be derived, and this profile goes beyond the clinical view of the diagnostic criteria. Individuals with Asperger's indicate lower self-efficacy, both general and occupational. Furthermore, a high concentration of individuals with Asperger's can be found in the areas I (Investigative) and C (Conventional) of Holland's RIASEC model.

Children with autism have a high rate of irritability and aggressive symptoms. Irritability or self-injurious behavior can result in significant harm to those affected, as well as to marked distress for their families. This paper provides a literature review regarding the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of irritability in autistic children. Although antipsychotics have not yet been approved for the treatment of autistic children by many countries, they are often used to reduce symptoms of behavioral problems, including irritability, aggression, hyperactivity, and panic. However, among antipsychotics, the Food and Drug Administration has approved only risperidone and aripiprazole to treat irritability in autism. Among atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine and quetiapine are limited in their use for autism spectrum disorders in children because of high incidences of weight gain and sedation. In comparison, aripiprazole and ziprasidone cause less weight gain and sedation. However, potential QTc interval prolongation with ziprasidone has been reported. Contrary to ziprasidone, no changes were evident in the QT interval in any of the trials for aripiprazole. However, head-to-head comparison studies are needed to support that aripiprazole may be a promising drug that can be used to treat irritability in autistic children. On the other hand, risperidone has the greatest amount of evidence supporting it, including randomized controlled trials; thus, its efficacy and tolerability has been established in comparison with other agents. Further studies with risperidone as a control drug are needed.

24903974	doi: 10.1002/aur.1394	The neuropsychology of male adults with high-functioning autism or asperger syndrome.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2014			Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is diagnosed on the basis of behavioral symptoms, but cognitive abilities may also be useful in characterizing individuals with ASD. One hundred seventy-eight high-functioning male adults, half with ASD and half without, completed tasks assessing IQ, a broad range of cognitive skills, and autistic and comorbid symptomatology. The aims of the study were, first, to determine whether significant differences existed between cases and controls on cognitive tasks, and whether cognitive profiles, derived using a multivariate classification method with data from multiple cognitive tasks, could distinguish between the two groups. Second, to establish whether cognitive skill level was correlated with degree of autistic symptom severity, and third, whether cognitive skill level was correlated with degree of comorbid psychopathology. Fourth, cognitive characteristics of individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) were compared. After controlling for IQ, ASD and control groups scored significantly differently on tasks of social cognition, motor performance, and executive function (P's < 0.05). To investigate cognitive profiles, 12 variables were entered into a support vector machine (SVM), which achieved good classification accuracy (81%) at a level significantly better than chance (P < 0.0001). After correcting for multiple correlations, there were no significant associations between cognitive performance and severity of either autistic or comorbid symptomatology. There were no significant differences between AS and HFA groups on the cognitive tasks. Cognitive classification models could be a useful aid to the diagnostic process when used in conjunction with other data sources-including clinical history.

Autism affects males more than females, giving rise to the idea that the influence of steroid hormones on early fetal brain development may be one important early biological risk factor. Utilizing the Danish Historic Birth Cohort and Danish Psychiatric Central Register, we identified all amniotic fluid samples of males born between 1993 and 1999 who later received ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) diagnoses of autism, Asperger syndrome or PDD-NOS (pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) (n=128) compared with matched typically developing controls. Concentration levels of Δ4 sex steroids (progesterone, 17α-hydroxy-progesterone, androstenedione and testosterone) and cortisol were measured with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. All hormones were positively associated with each other and principal component analysis confirmed that one generalized latent steroidogenic factor was driving much of the variation in the data. The autism group showed elevations across all hormones on this latent generalized steroidogenic factor (Cohen's d=0.37, P=0.0009) and this elevation was uniform across ICD-10 diagnostic label. These results provide the first direct evidence of elevated fetal steroidogenic activity in autism. Such elevations may be important as epigenetic fetal programming mechanisms and may interact with other important pathophysiological factors in autism.

University of Manchester, UK dougal.hare@manchester.ac.uk. Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership, UK.	Anxiety is a major problem for many people with Asperger's syndrome who may have qualitatively different fears from a non-Asperger's syndrome population. Research has relied on measures developed for non-Asperger's syndrome populations that require reporting past experiences of anxiety, which may confound assessment in people with Asperger's syndrome due to problems with autobiographical memory as are often reported in this group.Experience sampling methodology was used to record real-time everyday experiences in 20 adults with Asperger's syndrome and 20 neurotypical adults. Within-subject analysis was used to explore the phenomenology of thoughts occurring in people with Asperger's syndrome when they were anxious. Comparisons were made with the group that did not have Asperger's syndrome. The Asperger's syndrome group were significantly more anxious than the comparison group. Factors associated with feelings of anxiety in the Asperger's syndrome group were high levels of self-focus, worries about everyday events and periods of rumination lasting over 10 min. People in the Asperger's syndrome group also had a tendency to think in the image form, but this was not associated with feelings of anxiety. The results are discussed with reference to psychological models of Asperger's syndrome, cognitive models of anxiety and implications for psychological therapy for this group.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Elina Jokiranta, Andre Sourander, Auli Suominen, Laura Timonen-Soivio, Alan S Brown, Matti Sillanpää		The present population-based study examines associations between epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The cohort includes register data of 4,705 children born between 1987 and 2005 and diagnosed as cases of childhood autism, Asperger's syndrome or pervasive developmental disorders--not otherwise specified. Each case was matched to four controls by gender, date of birth, place of birth, and residence in Finland. Epilepsy was associated with ASD regardless of the subgroup after adjusting for covariates. The associations were stronger among cases with intellectual disability, especially among females. Epilepsy's age at onset was similar between the cases and controls regardless of the ASD subgroup. These findings emphasize the importance to examine the neurodevelopmental pathways in ASD, epilepsy and intellectual disability.

Seminars in speech and language	2014	Vivian Sisskin, Samantha Wasilus	Department Hearing and Speech Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland.	Atypical disfluency is a frustrating but little addressed clinical problem. The purpose of this article and case study was to summarize what is known about atypical fluency profiles and to describe the presenting behaviors and successful treatment of an unusual fluency profile (numerous word-final syllable repetitions) in a school-aged child. To this end, we describe the speech fluency and associated communication characteristics of a young boy diagnosed with Asperger disorder who was between 7;2 and 8;0 when seen for evaluation and treatment. We describe a therapy protocol that was successful in nearly eliminating these atypical disfluencies. The protocol emphasized self-monitoring and was integrated with other goals to improve the child's communication, which had features consistent with mild autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Following an 8-week treatment, the child significantly reduced his percent stuttered syllables of atypical disfluencies (word-final repetition and phrase-final repetition), resulting in significant qualitative improvements to his speech. This case study demonstrates that traditional stuttering modification treatment can be successful in reducing atypical and typical disfluencies in a child with concomitant social language impairment consistent with ASD. The therapy approach reported here may be useful in treatment of other cases having symptoms similar to the child we treated.

"Social and communication impairments are part of the essential diagnostic criteria used to define Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Difficulties in appreciating non-literal speech, such as irony in ASDs have been explained as due to impairments in social understanding and in recognizing the speaker's communicative intention. It has been shown that social-interactional factors, such as a listener's beliefs about the speaker's attitudinal propensities (e.g., a tendency to use sarcasm, to be mocking, less sincere and more prone to criticism), as conveyed by an occupational stereotype, do influence a listener's interpretation of potentially ironic remarks. We investigate the effect of occupational stereotype on irony detection in adults with High Functioning Autism or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS) and a comparison group of typically developed adults. We used a series of verbally presented stories containing ironic or literal utterances produced by a speaker having either a ""sarcastic"" or a ""non-sarcastic"" occupation. Although individuals with HFA/AS were able to recognize ironic intent and occupational stereotypes when the latter are made salient, stereotype information enhanced irony detection and modulated its social meaning (i.e., mockery and politeness) only in comparison participants. We concluded that when stereotype knowledge is not made salient, it does not automatically affect pragmatic communicative processes in individuals with HFA/AS."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Susanna Baldwin, Debra Costley, Anthony Warren		There is limited large-scale empirical research into the working lives of adults who have an autism spectrum disorder with no co-occurring intellectual disability. Drawing on data from a national survey, this report describes the employment activities and experiences of 130 adults with Asperger's Disorder (AD) and high functioning autism (HFA) in Australia. Outcome measures include current occupation; occupational skill level and alignment with educational attainment; type of job contract; hours of work; support received to find work; support received in the workplace; and positive and negative experiences of employment. The findings confirm and expand upon existing evidence that adults with AD and HFA, despite their capacity and willingness to work, face significant disadvantages in the labour market and a lack of understanding and support in employment settings.

Archives of suicide research : official journal of the International Academy for Suicide Research	2014	Sami Richa, Mario Fahed, Elias Khoury, Brian Mishara		This review focuses on suicide in patients with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) as well as risk factors and comorbidities of persons with ASD who have attempted suicide. Research was conducted by searching PubMed and Psychinfo for articles. Suicide in ASD is largely understudied. Although suicide is common in clinical samples, we have little knowledge of suicide in persons with ASD in the general population. Comorbidity, particularly with depression and other affective disorders or schizoid disorders and psychotic symptoms, is often reported, so it is difficult to determine if suicidality is associated with ASD or the comorbid disorder. Clinical samples suggest that suicide occurs more frequently in high functioning autism. Physical and sexual abuse, bullying, and changes in routine are precipitating events associated with suicide risk. Persons with ASD present risk factors inherent to their diagnosis (deficit in expression of feelings and thoughts), along with risk factors pertaining to the general population (abuse, depression, anxiety, etc.). The inability of persons with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) to express emotions and thoughts makes the diagnosis of suicidal ideation difficult and demands important adjustments to traditional psychotherapeutic interventions. More research is needed to determine the incidence of suicidal behaviors in persons with ASD, to identify risk and protective factors, as well as to assess the effectiveness of prevention strategies and interventions.

Prospective memory (PM) refers to the implementation of delayed intentions, a cognitive ability that plays a critical role in daily life because of its involvement in goal-directed behavior and consequently the development and maintenance of independence. Emerging evidence indicates that PM may be disrupted in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), potentially contributing to the functional difficulties that characterize this group. However, the degree, nature, and specificity of ASD-related impairment remains poorly understood. In the current study, children between 8 and 12 years of age who were diagnosed with ASDs (n=30) were compared with typically developing children (n=30) on a child-appropriate version of the Virtual Week board game. This measure provides an opportunity to investigate the different sorts of PM failures that occur. The ASD group showed significant PM impairment on measures of time-based (but not event-based) prospective remembering. However, only a subtle difference emerged between regular and irregular PM tasks, and group differences were consistent across these tasks. Because regular and irregular tasks differentially load retrospective memory, these data imply that the PM difficulties seen in ASDs may primarily reflect a monitoring deficit and not an encoding and memory storage deficit. PM performance was poorer under conditions of high ongoing task absorption, but the magnitude of this effect did not vary as a function of group. In both groups, time-based (but not event-based) PM difficulties were associated with functional outcomes in daily life, but only an inconsistent association with executive control emerged.

Molecular autism	2014	Jaroslava Durdiaková, Varun Warrier, Simon Baron-Cohen, Bhismadev Chakrabarti		Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) are a group of developmental conditions which affect communication, social interactions and behaviour. Mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction has been suggested as a mechanism of autism based on the results of multiple genetic association and expression studies. SLC25A12 is a gene encoding a calcium-binding carrier protein that localizes to the mitochondria and is involved in the exchange of aspartate for glutamate in the inner membrane of the mitochondria regulating the cytosolic redox state. rs2056202 SNP in this gene has previously been associated with ASC. SNPs rs6716901 and rs3765166 analysed in this study have not been previously explored in association with AS.

According to Antonovsky's salutogenic model, a strong sense of coherence leads to the view that the stressor is a manageable challenge rather than a burden and promotes healthier adaptation. This study examines the relationship between stress, TD sibling resources and the sense of coherence in TD siblings.

Utilising a quasi-experimental design, comparisons were made between individuals allocated to a group intervention program and individuals allocated to a waitlist. Following the intervention program, participants who were initially symptomatic reported significantly lower depression and stress scores on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales in comparison to individuals on the waitlist. There was no significant change in anxiety related symptoms. The benefits were maintained at 3 and 9 month follow-up. Our findings demonstrate the potential of CBT in a small group setting for assisting young people with ASD who have symptoms of depression and stress.

The ability to decide, what another person can or cannot see is referred to as ""level 1 perspective taking."" This is thought to be a process that we can make use of intentionally, but which also takes place spontaneously. Autism is characterized by impairments of social interaction, which are thought to be related to deficits in implicit rather than explicit perspective taking. In order to assess both levels of processing with regard to perspective taking, we employed an established task in patients and controls. Our results demonstrate that both groups engage in spontaneous level 1 perspective taking. In contrast to controls, however, patients reacted more slowly if they had to verify the other's as compared to their own perspective, which shows that participants with high-functioning autism have selective difficulties in explicit, but not implicit, level 1 perspective taking. These findings demonstrate that while spontaneous level 1 perspective taking appears to be intact in autism, this ability is impaired in patients when used explicitly."

Electronic address: sshamay@psy.haifa.ac.il. School of Education, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 59200, Israel.	Evaluation of the outcomes of our decisions may instigate comparisons of our actual outcome with those of others (social comparisons) or comparisons with alternative outcomes of choices not made (private comparisons). Previous research has suggested a deficit in attention to social information among individuals with autism spectrum disorders. As social comparison involves the processing of social information, here we investigated the orientation towards and sensitivity to social vs. private comparisons in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. We compared the sensitivity to social vs. private comparisons among individuals diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) or High Functioning Autism, using a task that entailed monetary rewards. Results showed that while individuals with AS generally demonstrate comparable sensitivity to absolute and relative rewards, they show less sensitivity to social comparison as compared to controls. Furthermore, they are characterized by a higher sensitivity to private rather than social comparison. These results suggest that low sensitivity to social comparisons is an important factor to consider in autism spectrum disorders.

ABI Rehabilitation New Zealand Ltd, Wellington, NZ. University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.	A growing number of studies have highlighted impairments in the ability of individuals with autism spectrum disorders to recall specific, personally experienced material. These difficulties have been related to underlying problems with autonoetic consciousness, namely the subjective awareness of one's own existence in subjective time. The current paper describes the manifestation of these difficulties in three individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. For the people described, lifelong collecting and hoarding behaviours appeared to serve the function of constituting and maintaining aspects of their sense of self, particularly the sense of continuity and agency over time. On the basis of this clinical information and previous research into self-related processes in people with autism spectrum disorders, an initial model of collecting and hoarding behaviours amongst individuals with Asperger syndrome was formulated. The implications of this formulation for both clinical practice and future research are discussed.

University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands Dr Leo Kannerhuis, The Netherlands. Innlandet Hospital Trust, Norway University of Oslo, Norway. Vestfold Hospital Trust, Norway.	The aim of this study was to analyse the development of verbal working memory in children with high-functioning autism compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and typically developing children. A total of 34 children with high-functioning autism, 72 children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and 45 typically developing children (age 9-16 years) were included at baseline and followed up approximately 25 months later. The children were given a letter/number sequencing task to assess verbal working memory. The performance of children with high-functioning autism on verbal working memory did not improve after 2 years, while improvement was observed in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and typically developing children. The results indicate a different developmental trajectory for verbal working memory in children with high-functioning autism compared to children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and typically developing children. More research is needed to construct a developmental framework more suitable for children with autism spectrum disorder.

Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Singapore.	Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with both core symptoms and associated symptoms (eg, irritability, aggression, and comorbidities) that affect both the individual and the family/systems around them. There have been recent advances in the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of ASD pertaining to genetics, epigenetics, neurological, hormonal, and environmental factors that contribute to the difficulties found in individuals with ASD. With this improved understanding, there has been a shift in the application of psychopharmacology in ASD and its related disorders. A literature review was conducted to examine research published in the last 5 years between different classes of psychotropic medications and ASD. The broad scope of the existing literature for the use of conventional medications is summarized and novel medications are discussed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Marisa G Filipe, Sónia Frota, São Luís Castro, Selene G Vicente		It is known that individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) may show no problems with regard to what is said (e.g., lexical content) but tend to have difficulties in how utterances are produced, i.e., they may show prosodic impairments. In the present study, we focus on the use of prosodic features to express grammatical meaning. Specifically, we explored the sentence type difference between statements and questions that is conveyed by intonation, using perceptual and acoustic measurements. Children aged 8 and 9 years with AS (n = 12) were matched according to age and nonverbal intelligence with typically developing peers (n = 17). Although children with AS could produce categorically accurate prosodic patterns, their prosodic contours were perceived as odd by adult listeners, and acoustic measurements showed alterations in duration and pitch. Additionally, children with AS had greater variability in fundamental frequency contours compared to typically developing peers.

Journal of medical biography	2014	Patricia Ranft	133 Hampton Roads Avenue, Hampton, VA, USA ranft1p@cmich.edu.	The article brings together contemporary research on autism spectrum disorder and historical sources concerning the medical condition of a 12th century nun, Hildegard of Bingen, to test two hypotheses: first, that Hildegard manifested disabilities that meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder and, second, that medieval monasticism was unwittingly well-suited to treat Hildegard's condition. Abundant Hildegardian sources document traces of autism spectrum disorder behaviour in Hildegard's unusual childhood and the composite picture that emerges, when these individual traits are gathered together, is consistent with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. The role monasticism played in helping Hildegard overcome these behaviours is documented and aspects that monasticism shares with modern autism spectrum disorder treatment programs are identified. By recognizing the presence of autism spectrum disorder traits in a major cultural leader of another era and by identifying the type of life she lived while those traits were minimized, we gain insight into the history of autism, medieval monastic life and effective elements of autism spectrum disorder treatment.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2015	Saray Bonete, María Dolores Calero, Antonio Fernández-Parra	University of Granada, Spain Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, Spain s.bonete.prof@ufv.es. University of Granada, Spain.	Adults with Asperger syndrome show persistent difficulties in social situations which psychosocial treatments may address. Despite the multiple studies focusing on social skills interventions, only some have focused specifically on problem-solving skills and have not targeted workplace adaptation training in the adult population. This study describes preliminary data from a group format manual-based intervention, the Interpersonal Problem-Solving for Workplace Adaptation Programme, aimed at improving the cognitive and metacognitive process of social problem-solving skills focusing on typical social situations in the workplace based on mediation as the main strategy. A total of 50 adults with Asperger syndrome received the programme and were compared with a control group of typical development. The feasibility and effectiveness of the treatment were explored. Participants were assessed at pre-treatment and post-treatment on a task of social problem-solving skills and two secondary measures of socialisation and work profile using self- and caregiver-report. Using a variety of methods, the results showed that scores were significantly higher at post-treatment in the social problem-solving task and socialisation skills based on reports by parents. Differences in comparison to the control group had decreased after treatment. The treatment was acceptable to families and subject adherence was high. The Interpersonal Problem-Solving for Workplace Adaptation Programme appears to be a feasible training programme.

University of Heidelberg, Germany SRH University Heidelberg, Germany sabine.koch@hochschule-heidelberg.de. University of Heidelberg, Germany. Central Institute of Mental Health Mannheim, Germany.	From the 1970s on, case studies reported the effectiveness of therapeutic mirroring in movement with children with autism spectrum disorder. In this feasibility study, we tested a dance movement therapy intervention based on mirroring in movement in a population of 31 young adults with autism spectrum disorder (mainly high-functioning and Asperger's syndrome) with the aim to increase body awareness, social skills, self-other distinction, empathy, and well-being. We employed a manualized dance movement therapy intervention implemented in hourly sessions once a week for 7 weeks. The treatment group (n = 16) and the no-intervention control group (n = 15) were matched by sex, age, and symptom severity. Participants did not participate in any other therapies for the duration of the study. After the treatment, participants in the intervention group reported improved well-being, improved body awareness, improved self-other distinction, and increased social skills. The dance movement therapy-based mirroring approach seemed to address more primary developmental aspects of autism than the presently prevailing theory-of-mind approach. Results suggest that dance movement therapy can be an effective and feasible therapy approach for autism spectrum disorder, while future randomized control trials with bigger samples are needed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Christina Mohr Jensen, Hans-Christoph Steinhausen, Marlene Briciet Lauritsen		This study investigated time trends and associated factors of incidence rates of diagnosed autism spectrum disorders (ASD) across the lifespan from 1995 to 2010, using data from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Registry. First time diagnosis of childhood autism, atypical autism, Asperger's syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder-unspecified (PDD-NOS) were identified, incidence rates were calculated, and data were fitted using non-linear least squares methods. A total of 14.997 patients were identified and incidence rates for ASD increased from 9.0 to 38.6 per 100,000 person years during the 16-year period. The increases were most pronounced in females, adolescents, adults, and patients with Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS.

We identified 418 studies; 14 met inclusion criteria. Studies consistently reported decreases in ASD diagnosis (range 7.3-68.4%) using DSM-5 criteria. There were statistically significant pooled decreases in ASD [31% (20-44), p = 0.006] and DSM-IV-TR subgroups of Autistic disorder [22% (16-29), p < 0.001] and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) [70% (55-82), p = 0.01]; however, Asperger's disorder pooled decrease was not significant [70% (26-94), p = 0.38]. DSM-5 will likely decrease the number of individuals diagnosed with ASD, particularly the PDD-NOS subgroup. Research is needed on policies regarding services for individuals lacking diagnosis but requiring assistance.

Individuals with Asperger syndrome had significantly lower scores in all measures of social cognition. The MASC-SP showed strong correlations with all three measures and relative independence of general cognitive functions. Internal consistency was optimal (0.86) and the test-retest was good. The MASC-SP is an ecologically valid and useful tool for assessing social cognition in the Spanish population."

This basic social ability was investigated in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA, n = 13, and matched controls, n = 13) by systematically varying motion properties of simple geometric shapes. Critically, trial-by-trial variations of (1) motion complexity of stimuli, and of (2) participants' individual animacy ratings were separately correlated with neural activity to dissociate cognitive strategies relying more closely on stimulus analysis vs. subjective experience. Increasing motion complexity did not yield any significant group differences, and in both groups, it correlated with neural activity in regions involved in perceptual and evaluative processing, including the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In contrast, although there were no significant behavioral differences between the groups, increasing animacy ratings correlated with neural activity in the insula, STG, amygdala, dorsal mPFC and PCC more strongly in controls than in HFA. These results indicate that in HFA the evaluation of stimulus properties cuing for animacy is intact, while increasing subjective ratings do not seem to be robustly related to social processing, including spontaneous mental state inferences and experience of salience."

Revista medico-chirurgicala a Societatii de Medici si Naturalisti din Iasi	2013	Ioana Cristina Amihăesei, Elena Stefanachi	"Discipline of Histology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Grigore T. Popa""- Iasi."	Autism is defined as a neurologic developmental disorder affecting brain and behavior, becoming usually apparent before 3 years of age, with stable evolution and no remission. No neurologic morphologic abnormality was associated with the disease. Several types of disease being described, autism is part of a larger spectrum known as autism spectrum disorders (ASD), or pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). The disease was first described long before it was defined and it has received its modern name. Main cause in the development of autism is considered to be genetic, up to 90 %. However, environmental factors could be incriminated, sometimes. The five types included in ASD are: Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), typical autism, Rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD). The classical triad of symptoms includes: social interaction impairments, communication impairments and repetitive, stereotype behavior. Diagnosis is based on interview of the parents and specialized observation of the suspected children. Main tools used in therapy are the family and the educational system. Well established, specialized programs of therapy were developed in time. Prognosis of autism is severe, since no cure is possible; nevertheless spontaneous recoveries do occur, in some cases.

A gap exists in the literature regarding aggression in autism spectrum disorders and how this behavior compares to other groups. In this multisite study, the Children's Scale for Hostility and Aggression: Reactive/Proactive and the Aggression subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist were rated for 414 children with autism spectrum disorder (autistic disorder, 69%; pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, 24%; Asperger's disorder, 7%) and 243 clinic-referred children without autism spectrum disorder, aged 1-21 years (mean age about 7 years). Participants were not selected for aggressive behavior. Relative to the comparison group, children with autism spectrum disorder were reported to have less aggression and were more likely to be rated as reactive rather than proactive. Among all subjects, sex was not associated with aggression; higher IQ/adaptive behavior and older age were associated with more sophisticated types of aggression, while lower scores on IQ, adaptive behavior, and communication measures were associated with more physical aggression. The interaction between demographic variables and diagnosis was significant only for age: younger but not older children with autism spectrum disorder showed less aggression than clinic-referred controls.

Italian Institute of Technology (IIT), Genova, Italy. Department of Computer Science, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. Institute of Psychology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany ; Scientific Institute ""E.Medea"", San Vito al Tagliamento (Pordenone), Italy."	Individuals with Asperger syndrome/High Functioning Autism fail to spontaneously attribute mental states to the self and others, a life-long phenotypic characteristic known as mindblindness. We hypothesized that mindblindness would affect the dynamics of conversational interaction. Using generative models, in particular Gaussian mixture models and observed influence models, conversations were coded as interacting Markov processes, operating on novel speech/silence patterns, termed Steady Conversational Periods (SCPs). SCPs assume that whenever an agent's process changes state (e.g., from silence to speech), it causes a general transition of the entire conversational process, forcing inter-actant synchronization. SCPs fed into observed influence models, which captured the conversational dynamics of children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome/High Functioning Autism, and age-matched typically developing participants. Analyzing the parameters of the models by means of discriminative classifiers, the dialogs of patients were successfully distinguished from those of control participants. We conclude that meaning-free speech/silence sequences, reflecting inter-actant synchronization, at least partially encode typical and atypical conversational dynamics. This suggests a direct influence of theory of mind abilities onto basic speech initiative behavior.
24488830	doi: 10.1542/pir.35-2-62	The clinician's guide to autism.	Pediatrics in review	2014	John W Harrington, Korrie Allen		On the basis of the most recent epidemiologic research, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1% to 2% of all children. (1)(2) On the basis of some research evidence and consensus, the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers isa helpful tool to screen for autism in children between ages 16 and 30 months. (11) The Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, changes to a 2-symptom category from a 3-symptom category in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition(DSM-5): deficits in social communication and social interaction are combined with repetitive and restrictive behaviors, and more criteria are required per category. The DSM-5 subsumes all the previous diagnoses of autism (classic autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified) into just ASDs. On the basis of moderate to strong evidence, the use of applied behavioral analysis and intensive behavioral programs has a beneficial effect on language and the core deficits of children with autism. (16) Currently, minimal or no evidence is available to endorse most complementary and alternative medicine therapies used by parents, such as dietary changes (gluten free), vitamins, chelation, and hyperbaric oxygen. (16) On the basis of consensus and some studies, pediatric clinicians should improve their capacity to provide children with ASD a medical home that is accessible and provides family-centered, continuous, comprehensive and coordinated, compassionate, and culturally sensitive care.

BMJ case reports	2014	Marine Grandgeorge, Eric Lemonnier, Céline Degrez, Nelle Jallot		Sensory behaviours were not considered as core features of autism spectrum disorders until recently. However, they constitute an important part of the observed symptoms that result in social maladjustment and are currently quite difficult to treat. One promising strategy for the treatment of these behaviours is the use of bumetanide, which was previously shown to reduce the severity of autism spectrum disorders. In this study, we proposed to evaluate sensory behaviours using Dunn's Sensory Profile after 18 months of bumetanide treatment in a 10-year-old girl with Asperger syndrome. Reported improvements covered a large range of sensory behaviours, including auditory, vestibular, tactile, multisensory and oral sensory processing. Although our results were limited to a single case report, we believe that our clinical observations warrant clinical trials to test the long-term efficacy of bumetanide to manage the sensory behaviours of people with autism spectrum disorders.

Recently, 3 unrelated children with a potentially novel 3q26.33-3q27.2 microdeletion syndrome were reported. We now report a new 9 ½ years old Caucasian boy with a 2 Mb deletion of the same genomic region in combination with Klinefelter syndrome. He presented with facial dysmorphism, developmental delay, Asperger syndrome, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections and hypogammaglobulinemia. The deletion in our patient improves upon the minimum region of the novel 3q26.33-3q27.2 microdeletion, and provides additional insights into the underlying genetic basis of the observed phenotypes. Consistent with two of three previously described patients, our patient also presents with thrombocytopenia, which we postulate is caused by haploinsufficiency of THPO. In addition, haploinsufficiency of LAMP3, a lymphoid and dendritic cell expressed protein that is implicated in bacterial and viral infections, pulmonary surfactant protein transport and amelogenin degradation, may be a novel cause for the immune deficiency, lung disease and dental abnormalities respectively as seen in these patients.

A growing consensus is that the autonomic nervous system serves a key role in emotional processes, by providing physiological signals essential to subjective states. We hypothesized that altered autonomic processing is related to the socio-emotional deficits in autism spectrum disorders. Here, we investigated the relationship between non-specific skin conductance response, an objective index of sympathetic neural activity, and brain fluctuations during rest in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder relative to neurotypical controls. Compared with control participants, individuals with autism spectrum disorder showed less skin conductance responses overall. They also showed weaker correlations between skin conductance responses and frontal brain regions, including the anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortices. Additionally, skin conductance responses were found to have less contribution to default mode network connectivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorders relative to controls. These results suggest that autonomic processing is altered in autism spectrum disorders, which may be related to the abnormal socio-emotional behaviours that characterize this condition.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2015	Lindsey Sterling, Patricia Renno, Eric A Storch, Jill Ehrenreich-May, Adam B Lewin, Elysse Arnold, Enjey Lin, Jeffrey Wood	University of South Florida, USA. University of California, USA lsterling@mednet.ucla.edu. University of California, USA. University of Miami, USA.	High rates of anxiety and depression are reported among youth with autism spectrum disorders. These conditions are generally assessed using measures validated for typically developing youth. Few studies have investigated their validity for autism spectrum disorders, which is crucial for accurate assessment and the provision of proper treatment. The Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale was evaluated with 67 youth with autism spectrum disorders to examine its utility in measuring anxiety and depression in this population. Parents and children (aged 11-15 years) referred to a multisite intervention study completed the Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule, Child Behavior Checklist, and Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results suggest acceptable internal consistency of the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale. Modest convergent validity was found among the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale and other standardized measures of anxiety and depression. There were stronger correlations between Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale Total scores and subscales of measures expected to correlate significantly than those not expected to correlate. One exception was a significant association between the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale and Child Behavior Checklist Attention subscale, calling into question the divergent validity in separating anxiety from attention problems. Overall, results suggest preliminary support for the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale in youth with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2015	Eric Zander, Harald Sturm, Sven Bölte	Stockholm County Council, Sweden. Karolinska Institutet, Sweden Stockholm County Council, Sweden. Karolinska Institutet, Sweden Stockholm County Council, Sweden eric.zander@ki.se.	The diagnostic validity of the new research algorithms of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the revised algorithms of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule was examined in a clinical sample of children aged 18-47 months. Validity was determined for each instrument separately and their combination against a clinical consensus diagnosis. A total of N = 268 children (n = 171 with autism spectrum disorder) were assessed. The new Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised algorithms (research cutoff) gave excellent specificities (91%-96%) but low sensitivities (44%-52%). Applying adjusted cutoffs (lower than recommended based on receiver operating characteristics) yielded a better balance between sensitivity (77%-82%) and specificity (60%-62%). Findings for the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule were consistent with previous studies showing high sensitivity (94%-100%) and alongside lower specificity (52%-76%) when using the autism spectrum cutoff, but better balanced sensitivity (81%-94%) and specificity (81%-83%) when using the autism cutoff. A combination of both the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (with adjusted cutoff) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (autism spectrum cutoff) yielded balanced sensitivity (77%-80%) and specificity (87%-90%). Results favor a combined usage of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule in young children with unclear developmental problems, including suspicion of autism spectrum disorder. Evaluated separately, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (cutoff for autism) provides a better diagnostic accuracy than the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised.

CoDAS	2013	Dionísia Aparecida Cusin Lamônica, Mariana Germano Gejão, Lívia Maria do Prado, Amanda Tragueta Ferreira		Hyperlexia is characterized by spontaneous and early acquisition of reading skills, manifested before the age of five, without any formal education. Expressive and receptive language deficit, excellent memory, delayed language skills, echolalia, perseverations, and difficulty to understand verbal contexts, are common symptoms in individuals with hyperlexia and global developmental disorders, including Asperger's syndrome. The aim of this study was to describe the reading skills of individuals with hyperlexia. The participants were six boys with a history of hyperlexia, perceived by relatives before 36 months of life, chronologically aged between four years and four months to five years and two months. The following evaluation procedures were applied: interview with the parents or responsible guardians, communicative behavior observation, Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), recognition of alphabet letters and numbers, School Performance Test, text reading, and reading comprehension. The participants showed different performances in the PPVT, and recognized letters, numbers and isolated words. There was difficulty in answering the writing subtest; the majority did not understand the text that they read and all of them demonstrated recognition of letters and numbers. Some participants were able to read words and texts. However, all participants presented alterations in other areas of language development, such as receptive vocabulary, communicative behavior and understanding of the material read, in addition to altered behaviors of social adaptation, both interactive and restrictive.

Frontiers in neuroinformatics	2013	José L Pérez Velázquez, Roberto F Galán	Department of Neurosciences, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University Cleveland, OH, USA. Neuroscience and Mental Health Programme, Division of Neurology, Hospital for Sick Children Toronto, ON, Canada ; Institute of Medical Science and Department of Paediatrics, Brain and Behaviour Centre, University of Toronto Toronto, ON, Canada.	"Along with the study of brain activity evoked by external stimuli, an increased interest in the research of background, ""noisy"" brain activity is fast developing in current neuroscience. It is becoming apparent that this ""resting-state"" activity is a major factor determining other, more particular, responses to stimuli and hence it can be argued that background activity carries important information used by the nervous systems for adaptive behaviors. In this context, we investigated the generation of information in ongoing brain activity recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and non-autistic children. Using a stochastic dynamical model of brain dynamics, we were able to resolve not only the deterministic interactions between brain regions, i.e., the brain's functional connectivity, but also the stochastic inputs to the brain in the resting state; an important component of large-scale neural dynamics that no other method can resolve to date. We then computed the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, also known as information gain or relative entropy, between the stochastic inputs and the brain activity at different locations (outputs) in children with ASD compared to controls. The divergence between the input noise and the brain's ongoing activity extracted from our stochastic model was significantly higher in autistic relative to non-autistic children. This suggests that brains of subjects with autism create more information at rest. We propose that the excessive production of information in the absence of relevant sensory stimuli or attention to external cues underlies the cognitive differences between individuals with and without autism. We conclude that the information gain in the brain's resting state provides quantitative evidence for perhaps the most typical characteristic in autism: withdrawal into one's inner world."

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	2015	Sarianna Barron-Linnankoski, Outi Reinvall, Anne Lahervuori, Arja Voutilainen, Pekka Lahti-Nuuttila, Marit Korkman		This study examined patterns of strengths and weaknesses in the neurocognitive performance of children with higher functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The participants were 30 children with higher functioning ASD ranging from 6 to 11 years, and 60 typically developing (TD) children, who were matched with the children with higher functioning ASD in terms of age, gender, and maternal education. The TD children were drawn from the Finnish standardization sample for the NEPSY-II. The cognitive abilities of the children with higher functioning ASD were assessed with the WISC-III, and the neurocognitive performance of the children with higher functioning ASD and TD children on the NEPSY-II was compared. The children with higher functioning ASD were found to have strengths in verbal reasoning skills with respect to the population mean and weaknesses in set-shifting, verbal fluency, and narrative memory in comparison with the TD children. Minor weaknesses were also observed in facial memory and fine and visuomotor skills.

Autism research and treatment	2013	M Ghaziuddin, K Welch	Center for Statistical Consultation and Research (CSCAR), University of Michigan Medical Center, Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0277, USA. Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan Medical Center, Plymouth Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0277, USA.	Although the DSM-5 has recently created a single category of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), delineation of its putative subtypes remains clinically useful. For this process, screening instruments should ideally be brief, simple, and easily available. The aim of this study is to describe the validity of one such instrument. We administered the Michigan Autism Spectrum Questionnaire (MASQ), a 10-item questionnaire, to 42 patients with ASD (age range 6-13 years, mean 9.7 years, SD 2.5, one female) and 18 patients with other psychiatric disorders (age range 6-17 years, mean 11.7 years, SD 3.8, 6 females). Responses to each item were scored from 0 to 4 yielding a total score of 30. Patients with intellectual disability were excluded. As a group, patients with ASD scored higher than those with other psychiatric disorders (Chi-square test with 1 df = 16.019, P < 0.0001). Within the ASD group, a linear discriminant analysis found that the best cut-off points were 22 or above for Asperger syndrome, 14 to 21 for autism/PDDNOS, and less than 14 for those with other psychiatric disorders. We propose that the MASQ can be used as a brief measure to screen high-functioning ASD from other psychiatric disorders and to identify its possible subtypes.

Honey.Heussler@mater.org.au.	Autism is an etiologically heterogeneous developmental disorder for which the range of genetic investigations has expanded considerably over the past decade. Introduction of chromosomal microarray (CMA) to clinical practice has expanded the range of conditions which pediatricians are able to detect. This study reviewed the utilization, yield and cost of genetic investigations in a sample of children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) in an Australian metropolitan child development service. Six hundred and ninety eight patients with PDD were identified from the clinic population. One hundred and ten (15.7%) of the clinic population had undergone investigation with chromosomal microarray, 140 (20.0%) with karyotype (KT), and 167 (23.9%) with Fragile X testing (FRGX). Twelve (10.9%) CMA findings were reported, of which seven (6.3%) were felt to be the likely cause of the child's clinical features. Five (3.5%) KT findings were reported, of which four (2.9%) were felt to be the likely cause of the child's clinical features. Two patients (1.2%) were identified with Fragile X expansions. One fifth of the clinic's recent PDD population had undergone testing with CMA. CMA appears to have increased the diagnostic yield of the genetic investigation of autism, in line with internationally reported levels. Number needed to test (NNT) and cost per incremental diagnosis, were also in line with internationally reported levels.

International journal of language & communication disorders	2014	Kathleen Scaler Scott, John A Tetnowski, James R Flaitz, J Scott Yaruss		In recent years, there has been increased identification of disfluencies in individuals with autism, but limited examination of disfluencies in the school-age range of this population. We currently lack information about whether the disfluencies of children with autism represent concomitant stuttering, normal disfluency, excessive normal disfluency, or some form of disfluency unique to the school-age population of children with autism.

Frontiers in human neuroscience	2013	Janina Neufeld, Mandy Roy, Antonia Zapf, Christopher Sinke, Hinderk M Emrich, Vanessa Prox-Vagedes, Wolfgang Dillo, Markus Zedler	Centre for Integrative Neuroscience and Neurodynamics, School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, University of Reading Reading, UK. Deparment of Medical Statistics, Georg-August-University Goettingen, Germany. Department of Clinical Psychiatry, Social Psychiatry, and Psychotherapy, Hannover Medical School Hannover, Germany. Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf Hamburg, Germany.	There is increasing evidence from case reports that synesthesia is more common in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Further, genes related to synesthesia have also been found to be linked to ASC and, similar to synaesthetes, individuals with ASC show altered brain connectivity and unusual brain activation during sensory processing. However, up to now a systematic investigation of whether synesthesia is more common in ASC patients is missing. The aim of the current pilot study was to test this hypothesis by investigating a group of patients diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (AS) using questionnaires and standard consistency tests in order to classify them as grapheme-color synaesthetes. The results indicate that there are indeed many more grapheme-color synaesthetes among AS patients. This finding is discussed in relation to different theories regarding the development of synesthesia as well as altered sensory processing in autism.
24365182		The canonical Wnt signaling pathway in autism.	CNS & neurological disorders drug targets	2014	Yinghua Zhang, Xiangshan Yuan, Zhongping Wang, Ruixi Li		Mounting attention is being focused on the canonical Wnt signaling pathway which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autism in some our and other recent studies. The canonical Wnt pathway is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration, especially during nervous system development. Given its various functions, dysfunction of the canonical Wnt pathway may exert adverse effects on neurodevelopment and therefore leads to the pathogenesis of autism. Here, we review human and animal studies that implicate the canonical Wnt signal transduction pathway in the pathogenesis of autism. We also describe the crosstalk between the canonical Wnt pathway and the Notch signaling pathway in several types of autism spectrum disorders, including Asperger syndrome and Fragile X. Further research on the crosstalk between the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and other signaling cascades in autism may be an efficient avenue to understand the etiology of autism and ultimately lead to alternative medications for autism-like phenotypes.

24362849	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-2025-2	A meta-analysis of differences in IQ profiles between individuals with Asperger's disorder and high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Hsu-Min Chiang, Luke Y Tsai, Ying Kuen Cheung, Alice Brown, Huacheng Li		A meta-analysis was performed to examine differences in IQ profiles between individuals with Asperger's disorder (AspD) and high-functioning autism (HFA). Fifty-two studies were included for this study. The results showed that (a) individuals with AspD had significantly higher full-scale IQ, verbal IQ (VIQ), and performance IQ (PIQ) than did individuals with HFA; (b) individuals with AspD had significantly higher VIQ than PIQ; and (c) VIQ was similar to PIQ in individuals with HFA. These findings seem to suggest that AspD and HFA are two different subtypes of Autism. The implications of the present findings to DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder are discussed.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2014	Kate Sofronoff, Jessica Lee, Jeanie Sheffield, Tony Attwood	The University of Queensland, Australia kate@psy.uq.edu.au. The University of Queensland, Australia.	Children with Asperger's syndrome are often reported by their parents as having difficulties communicating affection. This study aimed to develop a valid measure of affectionate behaviour that could be used to investigate and quantify these anecdotal reports and then be used in further intervention research. Using parent and expert focus groups, three measures (Affection for Others Questionnaire, Affection for You Questionnaire and General Affection Questionnaire) were developed with reference to the existing affection literature. The measures were completed by 131 parents of children with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. Psychometric assessment of the measures revealed clear factor structures with high internal consistencies and significant concurrent validities. The findings suggest many children with Asperger's syndrome have difficulties with affectionate behaviour that significantly impact their daily functioning and relationships with others, signalling future research needs to develop interventions in this area. Limitations of the research are also discussed.

Cognition & emotion	2014	Peter G Enticott, Hayley A Kennedy, Patrick J Johnston, Nicole J Rinehart, Bruce J Tonge, John R Taffe, Paul B Fitzgerald		There is substantial evidence for facial emotion recognition (FER) deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The extent of this impairment, however, remains unclear, and there is some suggestion that clinical groups might benefit from the use of dynamic rather than static images. High-functioning individuals with ASD (n = 36) and typically developing controls (n = 36) completed a computerised FER task involving static and dynamic expressions of the six basic emotions. The ASD group showed poorer overall performance in identifying anger and disgust and were disadvantaged by dynamic (relative to static) stimuli when presented with sad expressions. Among both groups, however, dynamic stimuli appeared to improve recognition of anger. This research provides further evidence of specific impairment in the recognition of negative emotions in ASD, but argues against any broad advantages associated with the use of dynamic displays.

Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) may increase accuracy of data compared with retrospective questionnaires by assessing behaviours as they occur, hence decreasing recall biases and increasing ecological validity. This study examined the feasibility and concurrent validity of an EMA tool for adolescents with High-Functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (HFASD). Thirty-one adolescents with HFASD completed a mobile phone EMA application that assessed stressors and coping for two weeks. Parents and adolescents also completed retrospective measures of the adolescent's coping/stressors. Moderate compliance with the EMA tool was achieved and some concurrent validity was established with the retrospective measure of coping. Concordance was found between the types of stressors reported by parents and adolescents but not the quantity. The results suggest adolescents with HFASD are capable of reporting on their stressors and coping via EMA. EMA has the potential to be a valuable research tool in this population.
24329407	doi: 10.1111/famp.12041	The efficacy of systemic therapy for internalizing and other disorders of childhood and adolescence: a systematic review of 38 randomized trials.	Family process	2013	Ruediger Retzlaff, Kirsten von Sydow, Stefan Beher, Markus W Haun, Jochen Schweitzer		Systemic therapy (ST) is one of the most widely applied psychotherapeutic approaches in the treatment of children and adolescents, yet few systematic reviews exist on the efficacy of ST with this age group. Parallel to a similar study on adults, a systematic review was performed to analyze the efficacy of ST in the treatment of children and adolescents. All randomized or matched controlled trials (RCT) evaluating ST in any setting with child and adolescent index patients were identified by database searches and cross-references, as well as in existing meta-analyses and reviews. Inclusion criteria were: index patient diagnosed with a DSM-IV or ICD-10 listed psychological disorder, or suffering from other clinically relevant conditions, and trial published by December 2011. Studies were analyzed according to their sample, research methodology, interventions applied, and results at end-of-treatment and at follow-up. This article presents findings for internalizing and mixed disorders. Thirty-eight trials were identified, with 33 showing ST to be efficacious for the treatment of internalizing disorders (including mood disorders, eating disorders, and psychological factors in somatic illness). There is some evidence for ST being also efficacious in mixed disorders, anxiety disorders, Asperger disorder, and in cases of child neglect. Results were stable across follow-up periods of up to 5 years. Trials on the efficacy of ST for externalizing disorders are presented in a second article. There is a sound evidence base for the efficacy of ST as a treatment for internalizing disorders of child and adolescent patients.
24329180	doi: 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153710	From Kanner to DSM-5: autism as an evolving diagnostic concept.	Annual review of clinical psychology	2014	Fred R Volkmar, James C McPartland		Seven decades have elapsed since Leo Kanner described the syndrome he termed early infantile autism. Over this time, and particularly over the past two decades, noteworthy changes have occurred in how the condition is conceptualized. Here we provide an overview of these changes, beginning with a brief discussion of the significance of classification in general before discussing Kanner's original paper and subsequent changes. We touch on relevant issues, such as comorbidity, dimensional aspects of diagnosis and screening, and the complex issue of diagnosis relative to eligibility for services. Approaches to diagnosis have tended to swing from emphasizing overarching groups (lumping) to focusing on potentially distinct subgroups (splitting). Autism raises particular problems given the broad range of syndrome expression over age and developmental level. The most recent revision of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic taxonomy marks a significant departure from its predecessor and has been the focus of much debate. It remains unclear which of the currently existing categorical approaches will ultimately be most widely applied. We hope to convey a sense of areas in which consensus has been achieved and areas of continued controversy.

The clinical assessment of ASD is lengthy, and has to be performed by a specialized clinician. Therefore, a screening instrument to aid in the identification of patients who may have undiagnosed ASD should be useful. The purpose of this study was to develop such a screening instrument.

Molecular autism	2013	Varun Warrier, Simon Baron-Cohen, Bhismadev Chakrabarti		Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are associated with deficits in social interaction and communication, alongside repetitive, restricted, and stereotyped behavior. ASC is highly heritable. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system has been associated consistently with atypicalities in autism, in both genetic association and expression studies. A key component of the GABA-ergic system is encoded by the GABRB3 gene, which has been previously implicated both in ASC and in individual differences in empathy.

24312293	pii: e81353	Reduced face aftereffects in autism are not due to poor attention.	PloS one	2013	Louise Ewing, Katie Leach, Elizabeth Pellicano, Linda Jeffery, Gillian Rhodes		This study aimed to determine why face identity aftereffects are diminished in children with autism, relative to typical children. To address the possibility that reduced face aftereffects might reflect reduced attention to adapting stimuli, we investigated the consequence of controlling attention to adapting faces during a face identity aftereffect task in children with autism and typical children. We also included a size-change between adaptation and test stimuli to determine whether the reduced aftereffects reflect atypical adaptation to low- or higher-level stimulus properties. Results indicated that when attention was controlled and directed towards adapting stimuli, face identity aftereffects in children with autism were significantly reduced relative to typical children. This finding challenges the notion that atypicalities in the quality and/or quantity of children's attention during adaptation might account for group differences previously observed in this paradigm. Additionally, evidence of diminished face identity aftereffects despite a stimulus size change supports an adaptive processing atypicality in autism that extends beyond low-level, retinotopically coded stimulus properties. These findings support the notion that diminished face aftereffects in autism reflect atypicalities in adaptive norm-based coding, which could also contribute to face processing difficulties in this group.
24307231	doi: 10.1002/aur.1351	Can adults with autism spectrum disorders infer what happened to someone from their emotional response?	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2014	Sarah Cassidy, Danielle Ropar, Peter Mitchell, Peter Chapman		Can adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) infer what happened to someone from their emotional response? Millikan has argued that in everyday life, others' emotions are most commonly used to work out the antecedents of behavior, an ability termed retrodictive mindreading. As those with ASD show difficulties interpreting others' emotions, we predicted that these individuals would have difficulty with retrodictive mindreading. Sixteen adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome and 19 typically developing adults viewed 21 video clips of people reacting to one of three gifts (chocolate, monopoly money, or a homemade novelty) and then inferred what gift the recipient received and the emotion expressed by that person. Participants' eye movements were recorded while they viewed the videos. Results showed that participants with ASD were only less accurate when inferring who received a chocolate or homemade gift. This difficulty was not due to lack of understanding what emotions were appropriate in response to each gift, as both groups gave consistent gift and emotion inferences significantly above chance (genuine positive for chocolate and feigned positive for homemade). Those with ASD did not look significantly less to the eyes of faces in the videos, and looking to the eyes did not correlate with accuracy on the task. These results suggest that those with ASD are less accurate when retrodicting events involving recognition of genuine and feigned positive emotions, and challenge claims that lack of attention to the eyes causes emotion recognition difficulties in ASD.

Individuals with Asperger syndrome are significantly exposed to the risk of suicidal behavior, especially during adolescence. The authors describe cases of suicidal behavior in two adolescent boys with Asperger syndrome.

Approximately 4% of children who are deaf or hard of hearing have co-occurring autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Making an additional diagnosis of ASD in this population can be challenging, given the complexities of determining whether speech/language and social delays can be accounted for by their hearing loss, or whether these delays might be indicative of a comorbid ASD diagnosis. This exploratory study described a population of 24 children with the dual diagnosis of ASD and hearing loss.

Deutsches Arzteblatt international	2013	Fritz-Georg Lehnhardt, Astrid Gawronski, Kathleen Pfeiffer, Hanna Kockler, Leonhard Schilbach, Kai Vogeley		As a result of the increased public interest in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), certain core manifestations of ASD--impaired social interaction and communication, bizarre interests--are now commonly recognized as being typical of autism, not only in children, but in adults as well. More often than before, general practitioners, neurologists, and psychiatrists find themselves being asked whether a patient is suffering from previously unrecognized Asperger syndrome (AS). The prevalence of ASD is estimated at 1%, and the ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed cases at about 3:2. Little is known about the diagnostic evaluation of AS in adulthood.

Auditory stream segregation allows us to organize our sound environment, by focusing on specific information and ignoring what is unimportant. One previous study reported difficulty in stream segregation ability in children with Asperger syndrome. In order to investigate this question further, we used an interleaved melody recognition task with children in the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this task, a probe melody is followed by a mixed sequence, made up of a target melody interleaved with a distractor melody. These two melodies have either the same [0 semitone (ST)] or a different mean frequency (6, 12 or 24 ST separation conditions). Children have to identify if the probe melody is present in the mixed sequence. Children with ASD performed better than typical children when melodies were completely embedded. Conversely, they were impaired in the ST separation conditions. Our results confirm the difficulty of children with ASD in using a frequency cue to organize auditory perceptual information. However, superior performance in the completely embedded condition may result from superior perceptual processes in autism. We propose that this atypical pattern of results might reflect the expression of a single cognitive feature in autism.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2015	Amie W Duncan, Somer L Bishop	Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, USA Amie.Duncan@cchmc.org. Weill Cornell Medical College, USA.	"Daily living skills standard scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-2nd edition were examined in 417 adolescents from the Simons Simplex Collection. All participants had at least average intelligence and a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regressions were used to examine the prevalence and predictors of a ""daily living skills deficit,"" defined as below average daily living skills in the context of average intelligence quotient. Approximately half of the adolescents were identified as having a daily living skills deficit. Autism symptomatology, intelligence quotient, maternal education, age, and sex accounted for only 10% of the variance in predicting a daily living skills deficit. Identifying factors associated with better or worse daily living skills may help shed light on the variability in adult outcome in individuals with autism spectrum disorder with average intelligence."

To advance understanding of underlying neural mechanisms, we measured brain hemodynamic activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in individuals with ASD and matched-pair neurotypical (NT) controls while they were viewing a feature film portraying social interactions. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used as a measure of voxelwise similarity of brain activity (InterSubject Correlations-ISCs). Individuals with ASD showed lower ISC than NT controls in brain regions implicated in processing social information including the insula, posterior and anterior cingulate cortex, caudate nucleus, precuneus, lateral occipital cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. Curiously, also within NT group, autism-quotient scores predicted ISC in overlapping areas, including, e.g., supramarginal gyrus and precuneus. In ASD participants, functional connectivity was decreased between the frontal pole and the superior frontal gyrus, angular gyrus, superior parietal lobule, precentral gyrus, precuneus, and anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus. Taken together these results suggest that ISC and functional connectivity measure distinct features of atypical brain function in high-functioning autistic individuals during free viewing of acted social interactions. Our ISC results suggest that the minds of ASD individuals do not 'tick together' with others while perceiving identical dynamic social interactions.
24272525	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1999-0	Metacognitive processes in emotion recognition: are they different in adults with Asperger's disorder?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Alyssa C P Sawyer, Paul Williamson, Robyn Young		Deficits in emotion recognition and social interaction characterize individuals with Asperger's Disorder (AS). Moreover they also appear to be less able to accurately use confidence to gauge their emotion recognition accuracy (i.e., metacognitive monitoring). The aim of this study was to extend this finding by considering both monitoring and control processes in emotion recognition among adults with AS. Those with AS were found to have difficulties acting on the basis of their metacognitive monitoring despite showing no deficits in their ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate decisions. It is suggested that adults with AS have difficulties interacting socially because they are less able to assess when they are making accurate emotion recognition decisions despite having the capability to do so.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2014	Sheena K Au-Yeung, Johanna K Kaakinen, Valerie Benson		"The present study examined how eye movements during scene viewing are modulated by adopting psychological perspectives in both adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically developing adults. In the current study, participants viewed house scenes with either non-perspective-taking (look for valuable items/features of the house that need fixing) or perspective-taking instructions (imagine that you are a burglar/repairman) while their eye movements were recorded. The eye movement measures revealed that for the ""look for the valuable items"" and burglar perspective task, the ASD group showed typical relevance effects (the preference to look at schema-relevant compared with schema-irrelevant targets) in their eye movements. However, we found subtle processing differences between the groups that were related to initial orienting to and processing of schema-relevant items for the ""look for the features that need fixing"" and the repairman perspective-taking task. There was an absence of a relevance effect for the ASD group for the repairman perspective and its non-perspective-taking equivalent instruction showing that the identification of items relevant to those schemas was more difficult for the ASD group. The present findings suggest that resolving ambiguity may be a defining feature of complex information processing deficits in ASD."

Psychotherapie, Psychosomatik, medizinische Psychologie	2014	Sandra Strunz, Isabel Dziobek, Stefan Roepke	Klinik für Psychiatrie und Psychotherapie, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin.	Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) without intellectual disability are often diagnosed late in life. Little is known about co-occurring psychiatric disorders and differential diagnosis of ASC in adulthood, particularly with regard to personality disorders. What kind of comorbid psychiatric disorders occur in ASC? Which are the most prevalent differential diagnoses in a sample of patients who seek autism specific clinical diagnostics? 118 adults who were referred with a presumed diagnosis of autistic disorder, were diagnosed with autism specific instruments and the prevalence of further psychiatric disorders was investigated. 59 (50%) fulfilled the criteria of ASC. 36% of the individuals with ASC fulfilled also criteria for a DSM-IV axis-I psychiatric disorder. Affective disorders (24%) and social phobia (14%) were the most prevalent comorbid disorders. The most frequent differential diagnoses were depression, social phobia, paranoid, avoidant and narcissistic personality disorder.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	2014	Jodene Goldenring Fine, Kayla A Musielak, Margaret Semrud-Clikeman		The current study investigated morphological differences in the corpus callosum in children ages 8 to 18 years old with nonverbal learning disability (NLD; n = 19), high-functioning autism (HFA; n = 23), predominantly inattentive ADHD (ADHD:PI; n = 23), and combined type ADHD (ADHD:C; n = 25), as well as those demonstrating typical development (n = 57). Midsagittal area of the corpus callosum and five midsagittal anterior-to-posterior corpus callosum segments were examined using magnetic resonance imaging. Controlling for midsagittal brain area and age, no group differences were found for total corpus callosum area. This finding indicates that higher functioning children on the autistic spectrum do not have smaller corpus callosi as has been found in previous research with heterogeneous samples. Following segmentation of the corpus callosum, the NLD group was observed to have significantly smaller splenia compared to all other groups. Smaller splenia in the NLD group was associated with lower WASI PIQ scores but not WASI VIQ scores. Children with HFA were observed to have larger midbody areas than children with NLD and neurotypically developing children. Children with HFA and NLD demonstrated behavioral symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity similar to the ADHD groups indicating that corpus callosum differences seen in the NLD and HFA groups are not related to these behaviors.

University of Vermont, USA mpotvin@uvm.edu. McGill University, Canada.	The health-related quality of life of school-aged children with high-functioning autism is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to compare the health-related quality of life of children with high-functioning autism to that of typically developing peers and to compare child-self and parent-proxy reports of health-related quality of life of children. A cross-sectional study of children with high-functioning autism (n = 30) and peers (n = 31) was conducted using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales. Children with high-functioning autism had significantly poorer health-related quality of life than peers whether reported by themselves (p < .001) or their parents (p < .001), although disagreement (intra-class coefficient = -.075) between children and parental scores suggested variance in points of view. This study specifically investigated health-related quality of life in children with high-functioning autism as compared to a sample of peers, from the child's perspective. It strengthens earlier findings that children with high-functioning autism experience poorer health-related quality of life than those without this disorder and points to the importance of clinicians working with families to identify areas in a child's life that promote or hinder their sense of well-being.

Journal of communication disorders	2013	Sloane Burgess, Lisa Audet, Sanna Harjusola-Webb		The purpose of this research was to begin to characterize and compare the school and home language environments of 10 preschool-aged children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Naturalistic language samples were collected from each child, utilizing Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) digital voice recorder technology, at 3-month intervals over the course of one year. LENA software was used to identify 15-min segments of each sample that represented the highest number of adult words used during interactions with each child for all school and home language samples. Selected segments were transcribed and analyzed using Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT). LENA data was utilized to evaluate quantitative characteristics of the school and home language environments and SALT data was utilized to evaluate quantitative and qualitative characteristics of language environment. Results revealed many similarities in home and school language environments including the degree of semantic richness, and complexity of adult language, types of utterances, and pragmatic functions of utterances used by adults during interactions with child participants. Study implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.

The purpose of this review is to synthesise primary research on suicidal behaviour among adolescents and young adults with autism spectrum disorders in order to estimate prevalence and to identify and critically evaluate risk factors for suicidal behaviour in this population. Four primary research studies were identified for this review following a comprehensive literature search. The available research provides little empirical evidence for the processes underlying suicidal behaviour in adolescents and young adults with autism.

24179850	doi: 10.1016/j.nicl.2013.06.015	Atypical excitation-inhibition balance in autism captured by the gamma response to contextual modulation.	NeuroImage. Clinical	2013	Tineke M Snijders, Branka Milivojevic, Chantal Kemner		Atypical visual perception in people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is hypothesized to stem from an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory processes in the brain. We used neuronal oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30-90 Hz), which emerge from a balanced interaction of excitation and inhibition in the brain, to assess contextual modulation processes in early visual perception. Electroencephalography was recorded in 12 high-functioning adults with ASD and 12 age- and IQ-matched control participants. Oscillations in the gamma frequency range were analyzed in response to stimuli consisting of small line-like elements. Orientation-specific contextual modulation was manipulated by parametrically increasing the amount of homogeneously oriented elements in the stimuli. The stimuli elicited a strong steady-state gamma response around the refresh-rate of 60 Hz, which was larger for controls than for participants with ASD. The amount of orientation homogeneity (contextual modulation) influenced the gamma response in control subjects, while for subjects with ASD this was not the case. The atypical steady-state gamma response to contextual modulation in subjects with ASD may capture the link between an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory neuronal processing and atypical visual processing in ASD.

Clinical	2013	Eugenia Radulescu, Ludovico Minati, Balaji Ganeshan, Neil A Harrison, Marcus A Gray, Felix D C C Beacher, Chris Chatwin, Rupert C D Young, Hugo D Critchley		Asperger syndrome (AS) is an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) characterised by qualitative impairment in the development of emotional and social skills with relative preservation of general intellectual abilities, including verbal language. People with AS may nevertheless show atypical language, including rate and frequency of speech production. We previously observed that abnormalities in grey matter homogeneity (measured with texture analysis of structural MR images) in AS individuals when compared with controls are also correlated with the volume of caudate nucleus. Here, we tested a prediction that these distributed abnormalities in grey matter compromise the functional integrity of brain networks supporting verbal communication skills. We therefore measured the functional connectivity between caudate nucleus and cortex during a functional neuroimaging study of language generation (verbal fluency), applying psycho-physiological interaction (PPI) methods to test specifically for differences attributable to grey matter heterogeneity in AS participants. Furthermore, we used dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to characterise the causal directionality of these differences in interregional connectivity during word production. Our results revealed a diagnosis-dependent influence of grey matter heterogeneity on the functional connectivity of the caudate nuclei with right insula/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate, respectively with the left superior frontal gyrus and right precuneus. Moreover, causal modelling of interactions between inferior frontal gyri, caudate and precuneus, revealed a reliance on bottom-up (stimulus-driven) connections in AS participants that contrasted with a dominance of top-down (cognitive control) connections from prefrontal cortex observed in control participants. These results provide detailed support for previously hypothesised central disconnectivity in ASD and specify discrete brain network targets for diagnosis and therapy in ASD.

Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Maj-Britt Posserud, Kyrre Breivik, Christopher Gillberg, Astri J Lundervold		With a view to developing a brief screening instrument for autism symptoms in a general population of adolescents, seven items from the Asperger syndrome (and high-functioning autism) diagnostic interview were adapted for use as self-report in an online questionnaire for youths aged 16-19 years (N=10,220). The selected items target lack of social understanding (4 items) and rigid and repetitive behavior and interests (RRBI; 3 items). Factor analyses were performed, and the seven items were also validated against self-reported ASD diagnosis. Best statistical model fit was found for a bifactor model with one general factor and two domain specific factors tied to social difficulties and RRBI. Both the general and the domain specific factors were associated with self-reported ASD diagnoses. The scale (referred to as the Autism Symptom SElf-ReporT for Adolescents and Adults--ASSERT) had good screening properties with a receiver operating curve-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.87 and a diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 15.8. Applying a modified scoring of the scale further improved the screening properties leading to a ROC-AUC of 0.89 and a DOR of 24.9. The ASSERT holds promise as a brief self-report screen for autism symptoms in adolescents, and further studies should explore its usefulness for adults.

Frontiers in genetics	2013	Harold Z Wang, Hai-De Qin, Wei Guo, Jack Samuels, Yin Yao Shugart		Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) comprise a number of underlying sub-types with various symptoms and presumably different genetic causes. One important difference between these sub-phenotypes is IQ. Some forms of ASD such as Asperger's have relatively intact intelligence while the majority does not. In this study, we explored the role of genetic factors that might account for this difference. Using a case-control study based on IQ status in 1657 ASD probands, we analyzed both common and rare variants provided by the Autism Genome Project (AGP) consortium via dbGaP (database of Genotypes and Phenotypes). We identified a set of genes, among them HLA-DRB1 and KIAA0319L, which are strongly associated with IQ within a population of ASD patients.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2014	James M Bebko, Jessica H Schroeder, Jonathan A Weiss		Children with autism may have difficulties in audiovisual speech perception, which has been linked to speech perception and language development. However, little has been done to examine children with Asperger syndrome as a group on tasks assessing audiovisual speech perception, despite this group's often greater language skills. Samples of children with autism, Asperger syndrome, and Down syndrome, as well as a typically developing sample, were presented with an auditory-only condition, a speech-reading condition, and an audiovisual condition designed to elicit the McGurk effect. Children with autism demonstrated unimodal performance at the same level as the other groups, yet showed a lower rate of the McGurk effect compared with the Asperger, Down and typical samples. These results suggest that children with autism may have unique intermodal speech perception difficulties linked to their representations of speech sounds.

Genetic factors contribute to the incidence of ASD evidently. However, the genetic spectrum of ASD is highly heterogeneous. Chromosomal abnormalities contribute significantly to the genetic deficits of syndromic and non-syndromic ASD. In this study, we conducted karyotyping analysis in a sample of 500 patients (447 males, 53 females) with ASD from Taiwan, the largest cohort in Asia, to the best of our knowledge. We found three patients having sex chromosome aneuploidy, including two cases of 47, XXY and one case of 47, XYY. In addition, we detected a novel reciprocal chromosomal translocation between long arms of chromosomes 4 and 14, designated t(4;14)(q31.3;q24.1), in a patient with Asperger's disorder. This translocation was inherited from his unaffected father, suggesting it might not be pathogenic or it needs further hits to become pathogenic. In line with other studies, our study revealed that subjects with sex chromosomal aneuploidy are liable to neurodevelopmental disorders, including ASD, and conventional karyotyping analysis is still a useful tool in detecting chromosomal translocation in patients with ASD, given that array-based comparative genomic hybridization technology can provide better resolution in detecting copy number variations of genomic DNA.

Four adults, aged 21 to 30 years, participated. We trained each individually using verbal and written instructions, modeling, and role play with feedback to teach 2 basic skills to an adult who played the role of a young child with autism. We evaluated generalization of the discrete-trial training skills by having the participant (a) teach the adult confederate 2 additional targets that we had not included in training and (b) teach a new skill to a young child with autism. Results indicated that 3 of the 4 participants rapidly acquired discrete-trial training skills and that these skills generalized to new targets with the confederate adults and to teaching an actual child with autism.

European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience	2013	Ludger Tebartz van Elst, Marion Pick, Monica Biscaldi, Thomas Fangmeier, Andreas Riedel		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by deficits in social cognition and competence, communication, highly circumscribed interests and a strong desire for routines. Besides, there are specific abnormalities in perception and language. Typical symptoms are already present in early childhood. Traditionally autism has been regarded as a severe form of neurodevelopmental disorder which goes along with overtly abnormal language, learning difficulties and low IQ in the majority of cases. However, over the last decades, it has become clear that there are also many patients with high-functioning variants of ASD. These are patients with normal language at a superficial level of description and normal and sometimes above average intelligence. In high-functioning variants of the disease, they may run unrecognized until late in adult life. High-functioning ASD is associated with a very high prevalence of comorbid classical psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, tics, psychotic symptoms or emotionally unstable syndromes. In many such cases, there is a causal relationship between ASD and the comorbid psychiatric conditions in that the specific ASD symptoms result in chronic conflicts, misunderstandings and failure in private and vocational relationships. These problems in turn often lead to depression, anxiety and sometimes psychosis-like stress reactions. In this constellation, ASD has to be regarded as a basic disorder with causal relevance for secondary psychiatric syndromes. In this paper, we summarize the classical presentation of high-functioning ASD in adult psychiatry and psychotherapy and suggest a nosological model to classify different ASD conditions instead. To conclude, we outline first treatment concepts in out- and in-patient settings.
24104519	doi: 10.1177/1362361313492393	Explicit versus implicit social cognition testing in autism spectrum disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2014	Björn Callenmark, Lars Kjellin, Louise Rönnqvist, Sven Bölte	Stockholm County Council, Sweden Örebro County Council, Sweden. Örebro County Council, Sweden Örebro University, Sweden. Umeå University, Sweden. Karolinska Institutet, Sweden sven.bolte@ki.se.	Although autism spectrum disorder is defined by reciprocal social-communication impairments, several studies have found no evidence for altered social cognition test performance. This study examined explicit (i.e. prompted) and implicit (i.e. spontaneous) variants of social cognition testing in autism spectrum disorder. A sample of 19 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and 19 carefully matched typically developing controls completed the Dewey Story Test. 'Explicit' (multiple-choice answering format) and 'implicit' (free interview) measures of social cognition were obtained. Autism spectrum disorder participants did not differ from controls regarding explicit social cognition performance. However, the autism spectrum disorder group performed more poorly than controls on implicit social cognition performance in terms of spontaneous perspective taking and social awareness. Findings suggest that social cognition alterations in autism spectrum disorder are primarily implicit in nature and that an apparent absence of social cognition difficulties on certain tests using rather explicit testing formats does not necessarily mean social cognition typicality in autism spectrum disorder.

Clinical linguistics & phonetics	2013	Su-Fen Huang, Manabu Oi		The present study investigated the hypothesis that children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (HFASD) have a greater difficulty in responding to Wh- than Yes/No questions across languages. Conversations between Taiwanese children and their mothers were investigated and the children's response adequacy to maternal questions in a semi-structured setting were examined. Twelve Taiwanese children with HFASD, ranging in age from 7.1 to 14.9 years old, were compared with 12 typically developing (TD) children matched on age, sex, IQ and mean length of utterance in syllable (MLUs). Compared to TD children, HFASD children produced more inadequate or inappropriate responses to Wh- and Yes/No questions than to A-not-A and Choice questions. Taiwanese HFASD children share a greater difficulty in responding to maternal Wh-questions with their Japanese counterparts and do not show a relative ease in responding to Yes/No questions, while A-not-A and Choice questions were easier to respond to for the Taiwanese children.
24092497	doi: 10.1007/s00439-013-1364-6	Establishing a reference group for distal 18q-: clinical description and molecular basis.	Human genetics	2014	Jannine D Cody, Minire Hasi, Bridgette Soileau, Patricia Heard, Erika Carter, Courtney Sebold, Louise O'Donnell, Brian Perry, Robert F Stratton, Daniel E Hale		Although constitutional chromosome abnormalities have been recognized since the 1960s, clinical characterization and development of treatment options have been hampered by their obvious genetic complexity and relative rarity. Additionally, deletions of 18q are particularly heterogeneous, with no two people having the same breakpoints. We identified 16 individuals with deletions that, despite unique breakpoints, encompass the same set of genes within a 17.6-Mb region. This group represents the most genotypically similar group yet identified with distal 18q deletions. As the deletion is of average size when compared with other 18q deletions, this group can serve as a reference point for the clinical and molecular description of this condition. We performed a thorough medical record review as well as a series of clinical evaluations on 14 of the 16 individuals. Common functional findings included developmental delays, hypotonia, growth hormone deficiency, and hearing loss. Structural anomalies included foot anomalies, ear canal atresia/stenosis, and hypospadias. The majority of individuals performed within the low normal range of cognitive ability but had more serious deficits in adaptive abilities. Of interest, the hemizygous region contains 38 known genes, 26 of which are sufficiently understood to tentatively determine dosage sensitivity. Published data suggest that 20 are unlikely to cause an abnormal phenotype in the hemizygous state and five are likely to be dosage sensitive: TNX3, NETO1, ZNF407, TSHZ1, and NFATC. A sixth gene, ATP9B, may be conditionally dosage sensitive. Not all distal 18q- phenotypes can be attributed to these six genes; however, this is an important advance in the molecular characterization of 18q deletions.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2014	Eva Hesselmark, Stephanie Plenty, Susanne Bejerot	Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden ehesselmark@gmail.com. Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden Northern Stockholm Psychiatry, VUB/KogNUS, St Göran Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.	Although adults with autism spectrum disorder are an increasingly identified patient population, few treatment options are available. This preliminary randomized controlled open trial with a parallel design developed two group interventions for adults with autism spectrum disorders and intelligence within the normal range: cognitive behavioural therapy and recreational activity. Both interventions comprised 36 weekly 3-h sessions led by two therapists in groups of 6-8 patients. A total of 68 psychiatric patients with autism spectrum disorders participated in the study. Outcome measures were Quality of Life Inventory, Sense of Coherence Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and an exploratory analysis on measures of psychiatric health. Participants in both treatment conditions reported an increased quality of life at post-treatment (d = 0.39, p < 0.001), with no difference between interventions. No amelioration of psychiatric symptoms was observed. The dropout rate was lower with cognitive behavioural therapy than with recreational activity, and participants in cognitive behavioural therapy rated themselves as more generally improved, as well as more improved regarding expression of needs and understanding of difficulties. Both interventions appear to be promising treatment options for adults with autism spectrum disorder. The interventions' similar efficacy may be due to the common elements, structure and group setting. Cognitive behavioural therapy may be additionally beneficial in terms of increasing specific skills and minimizing dropout.
24089369	doi: 10.1002/aur.1332	Increased coherence of white matter fiber tract organization in adults with Asperger syndrome: a diffusion tensor imaging study.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2013	Ulrika Roine, Timo Roine, Juha Salmi, Taina Nieminen-Von Wendt, Sami Leppämäki, Pertti Rintahaka, Pekka Tani, Alexander Leemans, Mikko Sams		To investigate whether there are global white matter (WM) differences between autistic and healthy adults, we performed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 14 male adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 19 gender-, age-, and intelligence quotient-matched controls. We focused on individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD), AS, to decrease heterogeneity caused by large variation in the cognitive profile. Previous DTI studies of ASD have mainly focused on finding local changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), two indexes used to characterize microstructural properties of WM. Although the local or voxel-based approaches may be able to provide detailed information in terms of location of the observed differences, such results are known to be highly sensitive to partial volume effects, registration errors, or placement of the regions of interest. Therefore, we performed global histogram analyses of (a) whole-brain tractography results and (b) skeletonized WM masks. In addition to the FA and MD, the planar diffusion coefficient (CP) was computed as it can provide more specific information of the complexity of the neural structure. Our main finding indicated that adults with AS had higher mean FA values than controls. A less complex neural structure in adults with AS could have explained the results, but no significant difference in CP was found. Our results suggest that there are global abnormalities in the WM tissue of adults with AS.
24081827	doi: 10.1007/s00406-013-0453-9	Automatic metaphor processing in adults with Asperger syndrome: a metaphor interference effect task.	European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience	2013	Ismene Hermann, Verena Haser, Ludger Tebartz van Elst, Dieter Ebert, Daniel Müller-Feldmeth, Andreas Riedel, Lars Konieczny		This paper investigates automatic processing of novel metaphors in adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and typically developing controls. We present an experiment combining a semantic judgment task and a recognition task. Four types of sentences were compared: Literally true high-typical sentences, literally true low-typical sentences, apt metaphors, and scrambled metaphors (literally false sentences which are not readily interpretable as metaphors). Participants were asked to make rapid decisions about the literal truth of such sentences. The results revealed that AS and control participants showed significantly slower RTs for metaphors than for scrambled metaphors and made more mistakes in apt metaphoric sentences than in scrambled metaphors. At the same time, there was higher recognition of apt metaphors compared with scrambled metaphors. The findings indicate intact automatic metaphor processing in AS and replicate previous findings on automatic metaphor processing in typically developing individuals.
24077546		[Early outcomes of Asperger's syndrome].	Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova	2013	A E Bobrov, V M Somova		Mental state of adult patients, who since childhood had features of Asperger's syndrome (AS), was studied. We examined 107 patients (89 men and 18 women). At the moment of inclusion in the study, all the patients met criteria of ICD=10 for AS. This was confirmed by the examination of the patients with the help of ASDASQ and ASDI scales. Based on the results of psychopathological and psychological five variants of AS outcomes in the age of early adulthood were identified as follows: integrated, inhibitory, peculiar, border-line and hypernormative. At the moment of examination, psychosocial compensation was observed in 38% of patients, only 28% of patients were on treatment and 20% had a history of transitory psychotic episodes. The authors conclude that the results of the study suggest the relatively favorable prognosis of AS. The differential clinical evaluation of this group as well as implication of adequate psychosocial and psychotherapeutic methods in their treatment is needed.

Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology	2014	Gregor Domes, Ekkehardt Kumbier, Markus Heinrichs, Sabine C Herpertz	1] Department of Psychology, Laboratory for Biological and Personality Psychology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany [2] Freiburg Brain Imaging Center, University Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. Department of General Psychiatry, Center of Psychosocial Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany.	The neuropeptide oxytocin has recently been shown to enhance eye gaze and emotion recognition in healthy men. Here, we report a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that examined the neural and behavioral effects of a single dose of intranasal oxytocin on emotion recognition in individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS), a clinical condition characterized by impaired eye gaze and facial emotion recognition. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined whether oxytocin would enhance emotion recognition from facial sections of the eye vs the mouth region and modulate regional activity in brain areas associated with face perception in both adults with AS, and a neurotypical control group. Intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin improved performance in a facial emotion recognition task in individuals with AS. This was linked to increased left amygdala reactivity in response to facial stimuli and increased activity in the neural network involved in social cognition. Our data suggest that the amygdala, together with functionally associated cortical areas mediate the positive effect of oxytocin on social cognitive functioning in AS.

24057130	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1927-3	Redefining autism spectrum disorder using DSM-5: the implications of the proposed DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Robyn L Young, Melissa L Rodi		A number of changes were made to pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) in the recently released diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (APA, Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, American Psychiatric Publishing, Arlington, VA, 2013). Of the 210 participants in the present study who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for a PDD [i.e., autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)], only 57.1% met DSM-5 criteria (specificity = 1.0) for autism spectrum disorder when criteria were applied concurrently during diagnostic assessment. High-functioning individuals (i.e., Asperger's disorder and PDD-NOS) were less likely to meet DSM-5 criteria than those with autistic disorder. A failure to satisfy all three criteria in the social-communication domain was the most common reason for exclusion (39%). The implications of these results are discussed.

Current clinical pharmacology	2013	Natalie Sochocky, Robert Milin		Second generation antipsychotics (SGA) have gained increased evidence for the treatment of irritability and aggression in children and adolescents with lower functioning autistic disorder. Individuals with Asperger's Disorder (AD) and High Functioning Autism (HFA) experience significant emotional and behavioral problems and psychiatric comorbidity. There is a need to review the published literature on SGA treatment efficacy in the AD and HFA populations to provide more effective treatment choices for these subgroups.
24042084	doi: 10.1097/DBP.0b013e3182a399a6	Asperger syndrome and DSM-5: a dilemma for a college freshman.	Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2013	Meghan G Galligan, Carl Feinstein, Stephen S Sulkes, Joan M Bisagno, Martin T Stein		Angela is an 18-year-old college freshman who made an appointment with her pediatrician because of academic and social difficulties at college. She was diagnosed with Asperger disorder at age 6 based on difficulties relating to adults and peers, perseverative patterns of interest, and normal language development.She received special education services in middle school to help follow directions and complete assignments. She reports feeling very isolated during this time. In freshman year of high school, she insisted on discontinuing special education and managed with weekly private individual psychotherapy.In sophomore year, Angela learned strategies to get additional help from her teachers about assignments, and her grades improved. Socially, she formed a close friendship with a classmate who was also on the autistic spectrum, and she found a group of friends through this individual. As a senior with an upward grade trajectory and good SAT scores, she was admitted to a competitive 4-year college. In a precollege consult 6 months ago, she was anxious about fitting in.Angela began college classes without accommodations, but she now describes a challenging semester. She has not made many friends. She finds her courses difficult and does not fully understand assignments. She believes her peers dislike her. She thinks she would benefit from receiving note-taking and other services and asks you to document her disability for the college so that she might obtain accommodations.You point out that the DSM-5 eliminates the Asperger category. Angela is concerned. She does not believe that her profile is consistent with autism spectrum disorder, and she fears that being labeled as autistic will be prejudicial at school. Yet she is worried about retaining eligibility for services on the basis of a disability. How do you counsel her?

24039228	doi: 10.1002/aur.1299	Empathic responsiveness of children and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2013	Anke M Scheeren, Hans M Koot, Peter C Mundy, Larissa Mous, Sander Begeer		Previous studies have shown reduced empathic responsiveness to others' emotions in preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and an intellectual disability. However, age and intelligence may promote children's empathic responsiveness. Therefore, we examined the empathic responsiveness in normally intelligent school-aged children and adolescents with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 151) and in a typically developing comparison group (n = 50), using structured observations and parent reports. Based on the observations, participants' responses to the emotional displays of an interviewer were surprisingly similar. However, compared with parents from the comparison group, parents of a child with ASD reported significantly fewer empathic responses, particularly when the child received a high score on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule. Even though parents report a reduced empathic responsiveness in school-aged children and adolescents with ASD, it may be difficult to find these empathic limitations during brief observations in a structured setting.

24029798	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2013.07.034	Mood symptoms in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders.	Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Luigi Mazzone, Valentina Postorino, Lavinia De Peppo, Laura Fatta, Valeria Lucarelli, Laura Reale, Giulia Giovagnoli, Stefano Vicari		Asperger Syndrome (AS) and High Functioning Autism (HFA) are psychiatric conditions belonging to the Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs), characterized by social dysfunction and focused interest, in the absence of mental retardation. Previous reports suggest that AS/HFA may be associated with important psychiatric comorbidities. Among the psychiatric internalizing disorders, depression and anxiety are probably the most common disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of mood disorders and identifying peculiar clinical features in subjects suffering from AS and HFA. 30 male patients with AS/HFA, 30 male patients affected by Major Depression (MD) and 35 male Typically Developing (TD) comparison were assessed with the CDI and the CDRS-R. Participants' parents were invited to complete the CBCL and the P-YMRS. Moreover, the CGAS was rated by the clinicians. The evaluation of depressive symptoms showed that AS/HFA group reported higher depressive symptoms, as showed by CDI total, CBCL internalizing and CDRS-R total, compared to the TD group. No significant difference of depressive symptoms was found between the AS/HFA and the MD group, with the exception of CDRS-R total score. Moreover, linear regression analysis in the AS/HFA group between CGAS and depressive symptoms revealed that a higher level of depressive symptoms increased the risk of poorer global functioning. These results suggest that the depressive symptoms in AS/HFA patients may be associated with poorer global functioning, with a consequent impairment in their psychological profile and social adjustment, and should alert clinicians to the importance of assessing mood disorders in order to choose the appropriate treatment.
24020859	doi: 10.1186/1753-2000-7-32	Treating clients with Asperger's syndrome and autism.	Child and adolescent psychiatry and mental health	2013	Alisa G Woods, Esmaeil Mahdavi, Jeanne P Ryan		Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affecting many individuals today. Although neurobiological correlates for AS have been identified, like many ASDs, AS is not completely understood. AS as a distinct disorder is also not universally accepted and in the DSM-5 AS is not considered a separate nosological entity. In contrast to some other ASDs, individuals with AS are commonly characterized by having standard or higher than average intelligence, yet difficulties in social skills and communication can present challenges for these individuals in everyday functioning. Counseling a person with AS or autism presents a unique challenge for the mental health care provider. We have compiled this review consisting of some recent ideas regarding counseling the client with AS with the goal of providing some clinical insights and practical clues. Although the focus of the present paper is largely on AS, many of these strategies could also apply to individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA).
24020153		Effects of a self-monitoring device on socially relevant behaviors in adolescents with Asperger disorder: a pilot study.	Assistive technology : the official journal of RESNA	2013	Jennifer B Ganz, Amy K Heath, John L Davis, Kimberley J Vannest		This article reports the results of two case studies. Two middle school-aged participants with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders were taught to self-monitor behaviors impacting their social acceptance by peers in their general education settings: oral self-stimulatory behaviors and conversation skills. Results indicate that the intervention was effective to some degree with both participants. As a result of the self-monitoring intervention, one participant decreased self-stimulatory behaviors; however, his data were highly variable throughout the study though lower on average during intervention than in baseline. The other participant's targeted skills in communication were only slightly improved. Self-monitoring using a vibrating reminder appears to be a low-cost intervention with high levels of social acceptability, low training requirements for teachers or students, and no social stigma.
24019124	doi: 10.1177/1362361313500382	Confirmatory factor analytic structure and measurement invariance of quantitative autistic traits measured by the social responsiveness scale-2.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2014	Thomas W Frazier, Kristin R Ratliff, Chris Gruber, Yi Zhang, Paul A Law, John N Constantino		Understanding the factor structure of autistic symptomatology is critical to the discovery and interpretation of causal mechanisms in autism spectrum disorder. We applied confirmatory factor analysis and assessment of measurement invariance to a large (N = 9635) accumulated collection of reports on quantitative autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale, representing a broad diversity of age, severity, and reporter type. A two-factor structure (corresponding to social communication impairment and restricted, repetitive behavior) as elaborated in the updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) criteria for autism spectrum disorder exhibited acceptable model fit in confirmatory factor analysis. Measurement invariance was appreciable across age, sex, and reporter (self vs other), but somewhat less apparent between clinical and nonclinical populations in this sample comprised of both familial and sporadic autism spectrum disorders. The statistical power afforded by this large sample allowed relative differentiation of three factors among items encompassing social communication impairment (emotion recognition, social avoidance, and interpersonal relatedness) and two factors among items encompassing restricted, repetitive behavior (insistence on sameness and repetitive mannerisms). Cross-trait correlations remained extremely high, that is, on the order of 0.66-0.92. These data clarify domains of statistically significant factoral separation that may relate to partially-but not completely-overlapping biological mechanisms, contributing to variation in human social competency. Given such robust intercorrelations among symptom domains, understanding their co-emergence remains a high priority in conceptualizing common neural mechanisms underlying autistic syndromes.
24014196	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1939-z	Reduction in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in young adults with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Leonardo Emberti Gialloreti, Matteo Pardini, Francesca Benassi, Sara Marciano, Mario Amore, Maria Giulia Mutolo, Maria Cristina Porfirio, Paolo Curatolo		Recent years have seen an increase in the use of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) evaluation as an easy-to-use, reproducible, proxy-measure of brain structural abnormalities. Here, we evaluated RNFL thickness in a group of subjects with high functioning autism (HFA) or with Asperger Syndrome (AS) to its potential as a tool to study autism pathophysiology. All subjects underwent high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography to evaluate RNFL thickness. HFA subjects presented with reduced global RNFL thickness compared both to AS subjects and controls. AS subjects showed a reduced nasal quadrant RNFL thickness compared to controls. Verbal-IQ/performance-IQ discrepancy correlated with RNFL thickness. Our data suggest that RNFL evaluation could help in the development of biological markers of autism pathophysiology.
23998995	doi: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2013.08.004	Automatic facial responses to briefly presented emotional stimuli in autism spectrum disorder.	Biological psychology	2013	Danielle Mathersul, Skye McDonald, Jacqueline A Rushby		"Emotion processing, including automatic facial mimicry, plays an important role in social reciprocity. Disruptions in these processes have implications for individuals with impaired social functioning, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Past research has demonstrated that ASDs are impaired in the recognition of briefly presented emotions and display atypical mimicry of emotions presented for protracted duration. Mimicry (electromyography; EMG) of briefly presented emotions was investigated in adults with ASDs. Concurrent measures of skin conductance and cardiac responses were used as markers of orientation and stimulus detection, respectively. A backward masking task was employed whereby the emotional face (happy, angry) was presented for 30 ms followed by a neutral face ""mask"". An implicit comparison task required rapid gender identification. The ASD group failed to differentiate by valence in their EMG (zygomaticus, corrugator) and demonstrated atypical pre- and post-stimulus arousal. These findings may provide a potential mechanism for marked deficits in social reciprocity."

Behavior modification	2013	Terry S Falcomata, Colin S Muething, Summer Gainey, Katherine Hoffman, Christina Fragale		We evaluated functional communication training (FCT) combined with a chained schedule of reinforcement procedure for the treatment of challenging behavior exhibited by two individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and autism. Following functional analyses that suggested that challenging behavior served multiple functions for both participants, we implemented FCT in which mands for a discriminative stimulus (S(D); wristband) were reinforced with access to the S(D) and all three functional reinforcers. Next, we modified the procedure by incorporating delays to increase ease of implementation and promote toleration of delays to reinforcement. Last, we made additional modifications to the procedure by incorporating a chained schedule of reinforcement such that (a) mands for the wristband were reinforced with access to the wristband and (b) specific mands for respective functional reinforcers were reinforced in the presence of the wristband. The results showed that the procedure successfully treated challenging behavior with multiple functions. Future directions in the evaluation and development of treatments that simultaneously address multiple functions are discussed.

Seizure	2013	Rohit Shankar, David Cox, Virupakshi Jalihal, Scott Brown, Jane Hanna, Brendan McLean		The incidence of sudden death appears to be 20 times higher in patients with epilepsy compared with the general population. Epilepsy-related death, particularly sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), is still underestimated by healthcare professionals and this may reflect the mistaken belief that epilepsy is a benign condition. The risk of death associated with epilepsy appeared rarely to have been discussed with patients or their families. It appears the decision to discuss SUDEP and also to peg SUDEP risk is arbitrary and clinical. Unfortunately there is no structured evidenced mechanism at present to represent person centered risk of SUDEP and there is currently no easy manner or template to have this discussion with the family and the patient.

Drug and alcohol dependence	2013	M Ramos, L Boada, C Moreno, C Llorente, J Romo, M Parellada		Adolescence is a stage of development with increased risk of drug use. Individual personality traits are among those factors that influence the onset of substance use in adolescence and its psychiatric comorbidity. Little research has been done on the comorbidity between substance abuse risk and Asperger syndrome, and none specifically in adolescence. The objective of this study is to assess the risk of drug use by adolescents with Asperger syndrome and compare it with that risk in control subjects. A secondary objective was to analyze the personality factors that may be associated with substance use in the same two groups.

23955101	doi: 10.3758/s13415-013-0205-3	Empathy and contextual social cognition.	Cognitive, affective & behavioral neuroscience	2014	Margherita Melloni, Vladimir Lopez, Agustin Ibanez		Empathy is a highly flexible and adaptive process that allows for the interplay of prosocial behavior in many different social contexts. Empathy appears to be a very situated cognitive process, embedded with specific contextual cues that trigger different automatic and controlled responses. In this review, we summarize relevant evidence regarding social context modulation of empathy for pain. Several contextual factors, such as stimulus reality and personal experience, affectively link with other factors, emotional cues, threat information, group membership, and attitudes toward others to influence the affective, sensorimotor, and cognitive processing of empathy. Thus, we propose that the frontoinsular-temporal network, the so-called social context network model (SCNM), is recruited during the contextual processing of empathy. This network would (1) update the contextual cues and use them to construct fast predictions (frontal regions), (2) coordinate the internal (body) and external milieus (insula), and (3) consolidate the context-target associative learning of empathic processes (temporal sites). Furthermore, we propose these context-dependent effects of empathy in the framework of the frontoinsular-temporal network and examine the behavioral and neural evidence of three neuropsychiatric conditions (Asperger syndrome, schizophrenia, and the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia), which simultaneously present with empathy and contextual integration impairments. We suggest potential advantages of a situated approach to empathy in the assessment of these neuropsychiatric disorders, as well as their relationship with the SCNM.

Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Jennifer S Beighley, Johnny L Matson, Robert D Rieske, Hilary L Adams		This article has been retracted: please see Elsevier Policy on Article Withdrawal (http://www.elsevier.com/locate/withdrawalpolicy). This article has been retracted at the request of the Editor in Chief, after review by an independent panel of experts, due to evidence of a compromised peer review process and the failure of one author to disclose significant conflicts of interest. An independent peer-review process is a cornerstone of scientific integrity that allows for research to be scrutinized before publication to ensure that conclusions are anchored in sound methodology and objective interpretation of the results. Equally important is that the readership of research is fully informed about any potential competing interests that may have influenced the research process. This article is being retracted because it did not include a declaration of a conflict of interest of one author in relation to diagnostic tools which the paper endorses. The same author was also the Editor in Chief of the journal at the time of publication and evidence indicates that the paper was accepted without any independent peer review by external reviewers.

Sub-clinical autistic-like traits (ALTs) are continuously distributed in the general population and genetically linked to autism. Although identifying the neurogenetic backgrounds of ALTs might enhance our ability to identify those of autism, they are largely unstudied. Here, we have examined the neuroanatomical basis of ALTs and their association with the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) rs2254298A, a known risk allele for autism in Asian populations which has also been implicated in limbic-paralimbic brain structures. First, we extracted a four-factor structure of ALTs, as measured using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, including 'prosociality', 'communication', 'details/patterns' and 'imagination' in 135 neurotypical adults (79 men, 56 women) to reduce the genetic heterogeneity of ALTs. Then, in the same population, voxel-based morphometry revealed that lower 'prosociality', which indicates strong ALTs, was significantly correlated to smaller regional grey matter volume in the right insula in males. Males with lower 'prosociality' also had less interregional structural coupling between the right insula and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, males with OXTR rs2254298A had significantly smaller grey matter volume in the right insula. These results show that decreased volume of the insula is a neuroanatomical correlate of ALTs and a potential intermediate phenotype linking ALTs with OXTR in male subjects.

Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2013	Shinya Fukuda	Atsugi Shinryo Clinic, Meiji University Student Counseling Room.	"This paper discusses the maladjustment reaction of adults with autism spectrum disorders such as Asperger syndrome to a working environment or university setting, from the viewpoint of a psychiatrist seeing them in areas of occupational and college mental health. The author is in charge of a day care program for company workers, called ""The Return-to-Work Support Course"", at a mental clinic. A total of 176 patients attended the program and most of them were originally diagnosed with depression and/or adjustment disorder. The author noted that five of them showed some traits of developmental disorder. They initially had been capable specialists at work, but started showing mental and psychosocial dysfunction as they received promotions and became team leaders or managers. It seems that changes in their work environment involving their superiors, co-workers, the organization, etc., easily affected their work performance and triggered their maladjustment, and finally caused their leave of absence. The author also works in a university student counseling room, and noted that some students started to show maladjustment in the course of writing their graduation thesis or applying for jobs, although they previously had performed fairly well at university. They could not maintain good communication with thesis advisers, could not perform adequately during a group discussion at a job interview, or could not cope with personnel offices appropriately. After being interviewed, they were diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Not only child psychiatrists but all psychiatrists should have a sufficient knowledge of developmental disorders, and they need to be cautious when they diagnose patients and inform them."
23944119		[Disclosure of the autism spectrum].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2013	Yuko Yoshida	Institute of Psychomedical Education for Children, Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic, Yoshida Clinic.	Since the concept of Asperger syndrome was advocated by the child psychiatrist Lorna Wing (1981), atypical cases not accompanied by intellectual disability have been considered for support. In clinical settings in the 1990s, children began asking the names of their diagnoses. In a field study by the authors, an increasing number of children at the age of 8 years realize the name of their diagnosis, and many children know their diagnosis at the ages of 12 years. Although explaining the diagnosis to the child plays an important role in the treatment of autism and Asperger syndrome in a clinical setting, very few studies have examined such explanations as part of the treatment technique. This paper presents the authors' efforts in psycho-medical education, by disclosing the diagnosis to the children. Further, the study examines the effects and side effects of diagnosis disclosure as a counselling technique. For the symposium's theme of 're-examining the clinical significance of diagnostic thresholds', in this manuscript, the author discusses her views on explaining the diagnoses to the children.
23944118		[Case study of 10 subjects diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders in adulthood and currently under long-term follow-up].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2013	Tokio Uchiyama	Faculty of Human Development and Culture, Fukushima University Graduate School Yokohama Psycho-Developmental Clinic.	This study involved 10 adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who were referred to a specialized developmental disability clinic and were being treated for periods extending to years. Checks included past diagnoses, the chief complaint at the first examination, psychiatric symptoms, medication, employment, and whether a diagnosis of ASD would have been possible during their formative years. Their age at referral was 21-30 and, at the time of this study, they were aged 25-40. There were eight males and two females, and their treatment periods were between four and 16 years. Using DSM-IV-TR criteria, six were diagnosed with autistic disorders and four with PDDNOS. Wing and Gould criteria showed nine with Asperger syndrome and one with autism. Their IQ ranged from 88 to 121, with the mean score being 103 (SD = 10.0). Eight of the 10 had previously been examined in psychiatric clinics, which identified two as having depression, two with schizophrenia, one with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and one with autism/Asperger syndrome, and there was no diagnosis for the other two. For these eight cases, the PDD-Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS) was used. The PARS early childhood peak score ranged from 9 to 41, so all reached the cutoff point of 9. At the time of this study, the following psychiatric symptoms were noted: three cases of depression, two of anxiety, one with auditory hallucinations, and one who displayed odd behavior and facial expressions that became apparent during the follow-up. In two cases there seemed to be no apparent psychiatric co-morbidity. The current PARS scores of 8 cases were between 12 and 38, and four cases exceeded the cutoff point of 20. One was taking anti-psychotic drugs for auditory hallucinations, four were using SSRI for anxiety and depression, and one was occasionally prescribed medication for anxiety. Four were not on medication. When diagnosing ASD in adulthood, interviewing using such instruments as PARS seemed useful. We should keep in mind that families tend not to recognize co-morbid psychotic symptoms.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Angela S Khor, Glenn A Melvin, Sophie C Reid, Kylie M Gray		Although daily hassles and coping are associated with behavior and emotional problems in non-clinical populations, few studies have investigated these relationships in individuals with high-functioning autism/Asperger's Disorder (HFASD). This study examined the relationships between daily hassles, coping and behavior and emotional problems in adolescents with HFASD. Thirty-one adolescents with HFASD completed questionnaires assessing their coping and behavior and emotional problems, and completed an Ecological Momentary Assessment run via a mobile phone application on their coping and daily hassles. Parents completed questionnaires of the adolescents' daily hassles, coping, and behavior and emotional problems. The disengagement coping style was associated with significantly higher levels of behavior and emotional problems regardless of respondent or methodology, suggesting it may be a valuable target for intervention.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Claire Jänsch, Dougal Julian Hare		The existence of a data-gathering bias, in the form of jumping to conclusions, and links to paranoid ideation was investigated in Asperger syndrome (AS). People with AS (N = 30) were compared to a neurotypical control group (N = 30) on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes and the Beads tasks, with self-report measures of depression, general anxiety, social anxiety, self-consciousness and paranoid ideation. The AS group performed less well than the control group on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task with regard to accuracy but responded more quickly and tended to make decisions on the basis of less evidence on the Beads Task with 50 % demonstrating a clear 'jumping to conclusions bias', whereas none of the control group showed such a bias. Depression and general anxiety were associated with paranoid ideation but not data-gathering style, which was contrary to expectation.

Journal of applied research in intellectual disabilities : JARID	2013	Ian Freckelton	Crockett Chambers, Melbourne, Vic., Australia. i.freckelton@vicbar.com.au	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as defined in DSM-V, can be relevant in a variety of ways to decision-making by courts and tribunals. This includes the family, disciplinary, discrimination and criminal law contexts. By reviewing decisions made by superior courts in a number of common law jurisdictions, this article identifies a pivotal role for mental health professionals closely familiar with both the disorder and forensic exigencies to educate courts about the inner world of those with ASD. Highlighting areas of criminality that court decisions have dealt with, especially in relation to persons with Asperger's Disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, it calls for further research on the connection between ASD, on the one hand, and conduct, capacities and skills, on the other hand. It urges enhancement of awareness of the forensic repercussions of the disorder so that expert evidence can assist the courts more humanely and informedly to make criminal justice and other decisions.
23918440	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1906-8	Savant syndrome: realities, myths and misconceptions.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Darold A Treffert	Agnesian HealthCare, 430 East Division Street, Fond du Lac, WI, 54935, USA, daroldt@charter.net.	It was 126 years ago that Down first described savant syndrome as a specific condition and 70 years ago that Kanner first described Early Infantile Autism. While as many as one in ten autistic persons have savant abilities, such special skills occur in other CNS conditions as well such that approximately 50 % of cases of savant syndrome have autism as the underlying developmental disability and 50 % are associated with other disabilities. This paper sorts out realities from myths and misconceptions about both savant syndrome and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) that have developed through the years. The reality is that low IQ is not necessarily an accompaniment of savant syndrome; in some cases IQ can be superior. Also, savants can be creative, rather than just duplicative, and the skills increase over time on a continuum from duplication, to improvisation to creation, rather than diminishing or suddenly disappearing. Genius and prodigy exist separate from savant syndrome and not all such highly gifted persons have Asperger's Disorder. This paper also emphasizes the critical importance of separating 'autistic-like' symptoms from ASD especially in children when the savant ability presents as hyperlexia (children who read early) or as Einstein syndrome (children who speak late), or have impaired vision (Blindisms) because prognosis and outcome are very different when that careful distinction is made. In those cases the term 'outgrowing autism' might be mistakenly applied when in fact the child did not have ASD in the first place.
23914277		A Comparison of the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC) and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) for the Quantitative Evaluation of Autism.	Journal of mental health research in intellectual disabilities	2013	David A Geier, Janet K Kern, Mark R Geier		The purpose of this study was to evaluate scores generated from the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), a parent-rated measure, and those derived from professionally completed Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) evaluations. A cohort of 56 participants diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder was used for the study, and each child was evaluated independently by the parent using the ATEC and a health care professional using the CARS. The Spearman's rank correlation statistic ρ was used to evaluate the correlation between ATEC and CARS scores. It was observed that there was a significant correlation between total ATEC and CARS scores (ρ = .71). Specific domains in the ATEC evaluation significantly correlated with CARS scores. Sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating characteristic confirmed the association between CARS and ATEC domains. The results help to validate the utility of the parentally completed ATEC in comparison with an established, professional-related measure of autism.
23902729	doi: 10.1186/1741-7015-11-175	The relationship of Asperger's syndrome to autism: a preliminary EEG coherence study.	BMC medicine	2013	Frank H Duffy, Aditi Shankardass, Gloria B McAnulty, Heidelise Als		It has long been debated whether Asperger's Syndrome (ASP) should be considered part of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) or whether it constitutes a unique entity. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV) differentiated ASP from high functioning autism. However, the new DSM-5 umbrellas ASP within ASD, thus eliminating the ASP diagnosis. To date, no clear biomarkers have reliably distinguished ASP and ASD populations. This study uses EEG coherence, a measure of brain connectivity, to explore possible neurophysiological differences between ASP and ASD.
23901152	doi: 10.1177/1362361313477920	Risk factors for bullying among children with autism spectrum disorders.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2014	Benjamin Zablotsky, Catherine P Bradshaw, Connie M Anderson, Paul Law		Although children with disabilities have been found to be at an increased risk of bullying, there are limited studies investigating predictors of bullying involvement in children with autism spectrum disorders. The current study presents findings from 1221 parents of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder who were selected from a national web-based registry. Parents completed a survey dedicated to the school and bullying experiences of their child, and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify child and school risk factors for involvement as victim, bully, or bully-victim. Additional analyses examined the risk of bullying involvement based on the amount of time spent in general education classrooms. Children diagnosed with Asperger's disorder, attending a public school or a school with a general education population, were at the greatest risk of being victimized in the past month. Children with comorbid conditions and a high level of autistic traits were the most likely to be victims, bullies, and bully-victims. Finally, children in full inclusion classrooms were more likely to be victimized than those who spend the majority of their time in special education settings. Future research studies should be invested in finding appropriate supports for children with autism spectrum disorder placed in inclusive settings.

BMJ open	2013	Peter E Langdon, Glynis H Murphy, Edward Wilson, Lee Shepstone, David Fowler, David Heavens, Aida Malovic, Alexandra Russell		A number of studies have established that children, adolescents and adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA) have significant problems with anxiety. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for anxiety in a variety of clinical populations. There is a growing interest in exploring the effectiveness of CBT for people with AS who have mental health problems, but currently there are no known clinical trials involving adults with AS or HFA. Studies with children who have AS have reported some success. The current study aims to examine whether modified group CBT for clinically significant anxiety in an AS population is likely to be efficacious.

23894683	pii: e70734	Motor imagery in Asperger syndrome: testing action simulation by the hand laterality task.	PloS one	2013	Massimiliano Conson, Elisabetta Mazzarella, Alessandro Frolli, Dalila Esposito, Nicoletta Marino, Luigi Trojano, Angelo Massagli, Giovanna Gison, Nellantonio Aprea, Dario Grossi		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental condition within the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) characterized by specific difficulties in social interaction, communication and behavioural control. In recent years, it has been suggested that ASD is related to a dysfunction of action simulation processes, but studies employing imitation or action observation tasks provided mixed results. Here, we addressed action simulation processes in adolescents with AS by means of a motor imagery task, the classical hand laterality task (to decide whether a rotated hand image is left or right); mental rotation of letters was also evaluated. As a specific marker of action simulation in hand rotation, we assessed the so-called biomechanical effect, that is the advantage for judging hand pictures showing physically comfortable versus physically awkward positions. We found the biomechanical effect in typically-developing participants but not in participants with AS. Overall performance on both hand laterality and letter rotation tasks, instead, did not differ in the two groups. These findings demonstrated a specific alteration of motor imagery skills in AS. We suggest that impaired mental simulation and imitation of goal-less movements in ASD could be related to shared cognitive mechanisms.

Cognitive neuropsychiatry	2014	Shelley Channon, Sarah Crawford, Danuta Orlowska, Nimmi Parikh, Patrizia Thoma		It is well established that autistic spectrum disorder is linked to difficulties with mentalising, but the ways in which this affects everyday behaviour is less well understood. This study explored the nature and extent of difficulties in everyday social functioning in adults with Asperger's syndrome (AS), since increased understanding can enhance the development of more effective intervention strategies.
23872941	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1888-6	Incidence and behavioral correlates of epileptiform abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Caitlin K Mulligan, Doris A Trauner		Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with an increased incidence of epilepsy and of epileptiform discharges on electroencephalograms. It is unknown whether epileptiform discharges correlate with symptoms of ASD. We completed a retrospective chart review of 101 patients with ASD who had overnight electroencephalograms. We looked for a relationship between epileptiform abnormalities and diagnosis, history of regression, communication skills, and other features associated with ASD. There was a higher incidence of epileptiform activity in children with stereotypies and aggressive behavior. The incidence of epileptiform abnormalities was significantly lower in Asperger's compared with more severe forms of autism. Results suggest that increasing severity of autistic symptoms may be associated with higher likelihood of epileptiform abnormalities. Whether treatment alters outcome is unknown.

Psychiatry research	2013	Bibbi S Hagberg, Agneta Nydén, Mats Cederlund, Christopher Gillberg		"Co-existence of Asperger syndrome (AS) and non-verbal learning disability (NLD) has been proposed based on the observation that people with AS tend to have significantly higher verbal than performance IQ (VIQ > PIQ by ≥ 15 points), one of the core features of NLD. In the present study we examined neuropsychological and social adaptive profiles with ""non-verbal learning problems"" associated with NLD in a group of individuals with AS followed from childhood into early adult life. The group was divided into three subgroups: (i) persistent NLD (P-NLD), i.e. NLD (VIQ > PIQ) both in childhood and early adulthood occasions, (ii) childhood NLD (CO-NLD), i.e. NLD (VIQ > PIQ) only at original diagnosis, or (iii) No NLD (VIQ > PIQ) ever (NO-NLD). All three subgroups were followed prospectively from childhood into adolescence and young adult life. One in four to one in five of the whole group of males with AS had P-NLD. The P-NLD subgroup had poorer neuropsychological outcome in early adult life than did those with CO-NLD and those with NO-NLD. There were no unequivocal markers in early childhood that predicted subgroup status in early adult life, but early motor delay and a history of early speech-language problems tended to be associated with P-NLD."
23857564	doi: 10.1002/jssc.201300486	Development and optimization of the determination of pharmaceuticals in water samples by SPE and HPLC with diode-array detection.	Journal of separation science	2013	Dragana Mutavdžić Pavlović, Danijela Ašperger, Dijana Tolić, Sandra Babić		This paper describes the development, optimization, and validation of a method for the determination of five pharmaceuticals from different therapeutic classes (antibiotics, anthelmintics, glucocorticoides) in water samples. Water samples were prepared using SPE and extracts were analyzed by HPLC with diode-array detection. The efficiency of 11 different SPE cartridges to extract the investigated compounds from water was tested in preliminary experiments. Then, the pH of the water sample, elution solvent, and sorbent mass were optimized. Except for optimization of the SPE procedure, selection of the optimal HPLC column with different stationary phases from different manufacturers has been performed. The developed method was validated using spring water samples spiked with appropriate concentrations of pharmaceuticals. Good linearity was obtained in the range of 2.4-200 μg/L, depending on the pharmaceutical with the correlation coefficients >0.9930 in all cases, except for ciprofloxacin (0.9866). Also, the method has revealed that low LODs (0.7-3.9 μg/L), good precision (intra- and interday) with RSD below 17% and recoveries above 98% for all pharmaceuticals. The method has been successfully applied to the analysis of production wastewater samples from the pharmaceutical industry.

Translational psychiatry	2013	J Horder, T Lavender, M A Mendez, R O'Gorman, E Daly, M C Craig, D J Lythgoe, G J Barker, D G Murphy		Dysfunctional glutamatergic neurotransmission has been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, relatively few studies have directly measured brain glutamate in ASD adults, or related variation in glutamate to clinical phenotype. We therefore set out to investigate brain glutamate levels in adults with an ASD, comparing these to healthy controls and also comparing results between individuals at different points on the spectrum of symptom severity. We recruited 28 adults with ASD and 14 matched healthy controls. Of those with ASD, 15 fulfilled the 'narrowly' defined criteria for typical autism, whereas 13 met the 'broader phenotype'. We measured the concentration of the combined glutamate and glutamine signal (Glx), and other important metabolites, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in two brain regions implicated in ASD--the basal ganglia (including the head of caudate and the anterior putamen) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex--as well as in a parietal cortex 'control' region. Individuals with ASD had a significant decrease (P<0.001) in concentration of Glx in the basal ganglia, and this was true in both the 'narrow' and 'broader' phenotype. Also, within the ASD sample, reduced basal ganglia Glx was significantly correlated with increased impairment in social communication (P=0.013). In addition, there was a significant reduction in the concentration of other metabolites such as choline, creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the basal ganglia. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, Cr and NAA were reduced (P<0.05), although Glx was not. There were no detectable differences in Glx, or any other metabolite, in the parietal lobe control region. There were no significant between-group differences in age, gender, IQ, voxel composition or data quality. In conclusion, individuals across the spectrum of ASD have regionally specific abnormalities in subcortical glutamatergic neurotransmission that are associated with variation in social development.
23837210		Olfaction in the autism spectrum.	Perception	2013	Sara A Galle, Valérie Courchesne, Laurent Mottron, Johannes Frasnelli		The autism spectrum (AS) is characterised by enhanced perception in vision and audition, described by the enhanced perceptual functioning (EPF) model. This model predicts enhanced low-level (discrimination of psychophysical dimensions), and mid- and high-level (pattern detection and identification) perception. The EPF model is here tested for olfaction by investigating olfactory function in autistic and Asperger participants. Experiment 1 targeted higher-order olfactory processing by assessing olfactory identification in nine Asperger, ten autistic, and eleven typically developed individuals. Experiment 2 focused on low-level olfactory processing; we assessed odour detection thresholds and odour discrimination in five Asperger, five autistic, and five typically developed males. Olfactory identification was impaired in autistic participants relative to control and Asperger participants. Typical performance in low-level olfactory processing suggests that neural mechanisms involved in the perceptual phenotype of AS do not affect structures implicated in olfactory processing. Reduced olfactory identification is limited to autistic participants who displayed speech delay and may be due to a reduced facility to use verbal labels. The apparent absence of enhanced olfactory perception of AS participants distinguishes the olfactory system from the other sensory modalities and might be caused by the absence of an obligatory thalamic relay.

Indian journal of psychiatry	2013	Douglas M Berger	Meguro Counseling Center, Tokyo, Japan.	"This article describes clinical pitfalls in our concepts of what it means for an illness, diagnosis, or evaluation and treatment methods to say that they have been ""tested"". This articles begins with the problems encountered in newborn testing for Krabbe Disease of the nervous system in New York State over the last few years as an example of a test that did not live up to its promise to help the society. Next, the article gives 3 examples of testing in psychiatry, 1. Psychological testing to make treatment decisions in children with depression, 2. Patient's and parents who have been told, or believe, that they have Asperger's disorder, and 3. The conclusions made about the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy based on clinical studies. The article's conclusion sums up these examples as reasons why we need to have a more practical and scientific approach to our understanding and implementation of tests used in our field."
23812759	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1871-2	Comparison among children with children with autism spectrum disorder, nonverbal learning disorder and typically developing children on measures of executive functioning.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Margaret Semrud-Clikeman, Jodene Goldenring Fine, Jesse Bledsoe		It has been suggested that children with nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD) or Asperger's Syndrome (AS) may show difficulties with executive functioning. There were 3 groups in this study who completed a neuropsychological battery of visual-spatial, executive functioning, and reasoning tasks; AS (n = 37), NLD (n = 31), and controls (n = 40). Results indicated that children in both clinical groups scored within average limits on measures of spatial reasoning and verbal ability. Fluid reasoning was also found to be within average ranges for all groups. The AS group experienced significant problems with cognitive flexibility compared to the other two groups. In contrast the NLD group showed fewer difficulties with cognitive flexibility but more problems with visual sequencing. These findings suggest that performance on executive function measures for children with AS or NLD is remarkably similar with subtle differences present.
23808126		Diagnosis and management of autism in adults.	The Practitioner	2013	Vyara Valkanova, Fiona Rhodes, Charlotte L Allan		Autism affects 1.1% of the adult population. The spectrum of symptoms is wide; some individuals have above average intelligence and are fully independent, while others have limited independence because of a learning disability. Developmental delay is a core feature, and autism is usually diagnosed in childhood. High-functioning individuals with autism, Asperger's syndrome, may remain undiagnosed until adulthood. Autism is a life-long condition characterised by problems in two core dimensions: difficulties with social communication and strongly repetitive behaviour, resistance to change or restricted interests.The history should identify early developmental and behavioural problems in different settings e.g. at home, in education or employment. Sensory and GI problems are very common, and should be asked about. The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10) is a 10-item questionnaire for people with suspected autism. The advantage of using this in primary care is that it provides a time-efficient, structured way of ascertaining key symptoms and clearly signals those who should be referred for further assessment. Patients should be referred if autism is suspected clinically and a diagnosis of autism should be confirmed by a specialist multidisciplinary team. If a diagnosis of autism is made, clinicians should do a risk assessment and formulate risk and crisis management plans. These should include details of the roles and responsibilities of both the specialist team and primary care team in managing crisis situations. For adults with autism a group-based or an individual learning programme to improve social interaction is recommended. Adults with autism have high rates of unemployment, and employment programmes have been successfully used to support people
23807202	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1870-3	DSM-5 ASD moves forward into the past.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Luke Y Tsai, Mohammad Ghaziuddin		The fifth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-5) (APA in diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, Author, Washington, 2013) has decided to merge the subtypes of pervasive developmental disorders into a single category of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) on the assumption that they cannot be reliably differentiated from one another. The purpose of this review is to analyze the basis of this assumption by examining the comparative studies between Asperger's disorder (AsD) and autistic disorder (AD), and between pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) and AD. In all, 125 studies compared AsD with AD. Of these, 30 studies concluded that AsD and AD were similar conditions while 95 studies found quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Likewise, 37 studies compared PDDNOS with AD. Nine of these concluded that PDDNOS did not differ significantly from AD while 28 reported quantitative and qualitative differences between them. Taken together, these findings do not support the conceptualization of AD, AsD and PDDNOS as a single category of ASD. Irrespective of the changes proposed by the DSM-5, future research and clinical practice will continue to find ways to meaningfully subtype the ASD.
23803646	doi: 10.1177/1744629513494928	Exploring fathers' perceptions of parenting a child with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of intellectual disabilities : JOID	2013	Maeve O' Halloran, John Sweeney, Owen Doody		This study explores Irish fathers' perceptions of parenting a child with Asperger syndrome (AS). Ethical approval was granted by the service provider, and Husserlian phenomenological approach facilitated the exploration. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews of nine fathers in the West region of Ireland. Data were transcribed and analysed using Colaizzi's (1978) method. The study highlighted that parenting a child with AS is an arduous task, but while there are difficulties, many positive aspects to their parenting experience were reported. Overall, the study highlights the importance of listening to parents and their initial concerns regarding their child's development.
23793277		Asperger Syndrome: a frequent comorbidity in first diagnosed adult ADHD patients?	Psychiatria Danubina	2013	Mandy Roy, Martin D Ohlmeier, Lasse Osterhagen, Vanessa Prox-Vagedes, Wolfgang Dillo		Because adult ADHD is often accompanied by psychiatric comorbidities, the diagnostic process should include a thorough investigation for comorbid disorders. Asperger-Syndrome is rarely reported in adult ADHD and commonly little attention is paid to this possible comorbidity.
23788522	doi: 10.1002/aur.1283	Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in adults with autism spectrum disorders.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2013	Kate Johnston, Antonia Dittner, Jessica Bramham, Clodagh Murphy, Anya Knight, Ailsa Russell		"Features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and impairments on neuropsychological, tests of attention have been documented in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). To date, there has been a lack of research comparing attention in adults with ASD and adults with ADHD. In study 1, 31 adults with ASD and average intellectual function completed self-report measures of ADHD symptoms. These were compared with self-report measures of ADHD symptoms in 38 adults with ADHD and 29 general population controls. In study 2, 28 adults with a diagnosis of ASD were compared with an age- and intelligence quotient-matched sample of 28 adults with ADHD across a range of measures of attention. Study 1 showed that 36.7% of adults with ASD met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV criteria for current ADHD ""caseness"" (Barkley Current self-report scores questionnaire). Those with a diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified were most likely to describe ADHD symptoms. The ASD group differed significantly from both the ADHD and control groups on total and individual symptom self-report scores. On neuropsychological testing, adults with ASD and ADHD showed comparable performance on tests of selective attention. Significant group differences were seen on measures of attentional switching; adults with ADHD were significantly faster and more inaccurate, and individuals with Asperger's syndrome showed a significantly slower and more accurate response style. Self-reported rates of ADHD among adults with ASD are significantly higher than in the general adult population and may be underdiagnosed. Adults with ASD have attentional difficulties on some neuropsychological measures."
23769996	doi: 10.1016/j.bbr.2013.06.012	Autism genetics.	Behavioural brain research	2013	Antonio M Persico, Valerio Napolioni		"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a severe neuropsychiatric disease with strong genetic underpinnings. However, genetic contributions to autism are extremely heterogeneous, with many different loci underlying the disease to a different extent in different individuals. Moreover, the phenotypic expression (i.e., ""penetrance"") of these genetic components is also highly variable, ranging from fully penetrant point mutations to polygenic forms with multiple gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Furthermore, many genes involved in ASD are also involved in intellectual disability, further underscoring their lack of specificity in phenotypic expression. We shall hereby review current knowledge on the genetic basis of ASD, spanning genetic/genomic syndromes associated with autism, monogenic forms due to copy number variants (CNVs) or rare point mutations, mitochondrial forms, and polygenic autisms. Finally, the recent contributions of genome-wide association and whole exome sequencing studies will be highlighted."

Disability and health journal	2013	Ellen Giarelli, Kathleen Fisher		Transition to community (TC) is the movement out of secondary school to independent living or higher education. It is challenging for young people who have typical neurodevelopment and daunting for those who have neurodevelopmental characteristics associated with Asperger syndrome (AS).
23766737		Prospective, blinded exploratory evaluation of the PlayWisely program in children with autism spectrum disorder.	The Yale journal of biology and medicine	2013	Janet K Kern, Carolyn R Garver, Jyutika A Mehta, Patricia A Hannan, Liz E Bakken, Aileen M Vidaud, Judie Abraham, Yahya Daoud		The purpose of the study was to explore a low-cost intervention that targets an increasingly common developmental disorder. The study was a blinded, exploratory evaluation of the PlayWisely program on autism symptoms and essential learning foundation skills (attention, recognition, and memory skills) in children with a diagnosis of autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome (AS). Eighteen children, 1 to 10 years of age, were evaluated using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS2); the PlayWisely Interactive Test of Attention, Recognition, and Memory Skills; Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT). There were significant treatment effects for the PlayWisely measure on the Yellow Sets that examine recognition; Purple Sets that examine brain region agility and early memory skills; Blue Sets that examine phonemic awareness and recognition; and for the Total Sets, with a similar trend toward improvement in the Green Sets that examine perception and Red Sets that examine attention. No other measures reached statistical significance. The results suggest that PlayWisely can improve recognition, brain region agility, phonemic awareness, letter recognition, and early memory skills in ASD. It was observed by the parents, coaches, and study investigators that the children who were less than 3 years of age showed improvements in autism symptoms; however, the group was too small to reach statistical significance. Future studies are needed to see if this intervention can mitigate autism symptoms in very young children with ASD.
23748435	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1858-z	Brain routes for reading in adults with and without autism: EMEG evidence.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Rachel L Moseley, Friedemann Pulvermüller, Bettina Mohr, Michael V Lombardo, Simon Baron-Cohen, Yury Shtyrov		Reading utilises at least two neural pathways. The temporal lexical route visually maps whole words to their lexical entries, whilst the nonlexical route decodes words phonologically via parietal cortex. Readers typically employ the lexical route for familiar words, but poor comprehension plus precocity at mechanically 'sounding out' words suggests that differences might exist in autism. Combined MEG/EEG recordings of adults with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) and controls while reading revealed preferential recruitment of temporal areas in controls and additional parietal recruitment in ASC. Furthermore, a lack of differences between semantic word categories was consistent with previous suggestion that people with ASC may lack a 'default' lexical-semantic processing mode. These results are discussed with reference to dual-route models of reading.
23739773	doi: 10.1177/1363459313488006	'DSM-V is taking away our identity': the reaction of the online community to the proposed changes in the diagnosis of Asperger's disorder.	Health (London, England : 1997)	2014	David C Giles	University of Winchester, UK.	This article considers the fate of Asperger's disorder in the light of proposals for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) to collapse Asperger's disorder along with other pervasive developmental disorders into a general spectrum of autism. It is argued that a powerful lay and scientific culture has evolved around the concept of Asperger's disorder, which has found a particularly compelling voice over the last decade in the online Asperger community, with websites such as Wrong Planet recruiting tens of thousands of members. In order to assess the impact of these proposed changes on the online Asperger community, 19 threads on the topic of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.) are analysed according to the arguments that community members put forward in favour of, or in opposition to, the proposals. Many members embrace the notion of the spectrum and have already coined a new identity - 'spectrumite' - to adapt to the diagnostic shift. Others, however, are suspicious of the motives behind the absorption of Asperger's disorder, and potential threats to the provision of services as well as the strong 'aspie' identity that reflects the large literature and the online public sphere around Asperger's disorder. To what extent this culture poses a challenge to the authority of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders is uncertain at present.

23722568	doi: 10.1097/MRR.0b013e328362491c	Students with disabilities in higher education - perceptions of support needs and received support: a pilot study.	International journal of rehabilitation research. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Rehabilitationsforschung. Revue internationale de recherches de readaptation	2013	Ann Simmeborn Fleischer, Margareta Adolfsson, Mats Granlund		Students with disabilities in higher education frequently need support to succeed in their studies. Perceived problems in managing studies and everyday life may be the same for students with different disabilities, although the reasons for support may vary between them. In this pilot study, a questionnaire aimed to survey everyday functioning in students with disabilities was tested. Thirty-four students with Asperger syndrome, motor disabilities or deafness/hearing impairments were asked 55 close-ended and open-ended questions on participation restrictions and available support programmes. One aim of this study was to test the usefulness of the questionnaire, and another aim was to identify students' perceptions of their everyday student life and the support they are offered, with a special focus on comparing perceptions of needs and support between students with Asperger syndrome and other student groups. The results indicate the need to plan recruitment of participants carefully and that the questionnaire was useful. The descriptive analyses indicated that the groups primarily reported the same difficulties; however, the open-ended comments indicated that the reasons for the problems vary between the groups. It indicates that Likert-type responses to questions concerning perceived difficulties need to be supplemented by open-ended questions on the perceived reasons to problems.

Psychology & health	2013	N Ruiz-Robledillo, L Moya-Albiol		Caring for offspring with autism spectrum disorders entails high levels of stress for a long period of time and is associated with several types of health complaints. Few studies have focused on specific effects of particular disorders in the spectrum. This study was carried out with the aim of evaluating the global health of parents of people with Asperger syndrome (N = 53) compared to those of typically developing children (N = 54) through self-reported measures (medication consumption and somatic symptoms) and biological markers (cortisol awakening response [CAR]). Additionally, we analysed various psychological variables as potential predictors of caregiver health. We found that caregivers take more medication and have worse self-reported health than controls, but there were no significant differences in CAR between the groups. However, after controlling for negative affect, differences between groups in CAR reached significance. With regards to predictor variables, anxiety trait, cognitive-coping style, burden and anger temperament were significantly associated with caregiver's self-reported health. These findings underline the need to develop interventions that foster improvements in the health of caregivers, reduce their burden and enhance their quality of life.
23695223	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1851-6	Are autistic traits measured equivalently in individuals with and without an autism spectrum disorder? An invariance analysis of the Autism Spectrum Quotient Short Form.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2014	Aja L Murray, Tom Booth, Karen McKenzie, Renate Kuenssberg, Michael O'Donnell		It is common to administer measures of autistic traits to those without autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with, for example, the aim of understanding autistic personality characteristics in non-autistic individuals. Little research has examined the extent to which measures of autistic traits actually measure the same traits in the same way across those with and without an ASD. We addressed this question using a multi-group confirmatory factor invariance analysis of the Autism Quotient Short Form (AQ-S: Hoekstra et al. in J Autism Dev Disord 41(5):589-596, 2011) across those with (n = 148) and without (n = 168) ASD. Metric variance (equality of factor loadings), but not scalar invariance (equality of thresholds), held suggesting that the AQ-S measures the same latent traits in both groups, but with a bias in the manner in which trait levels are estimated. We, therefore, argue that the AQ-S can be used to investigate possible causes and consequences of autistic traits in both groups separately, but caution is due when combining or comparing levels of autistic traits across the two groups.

23645093	doi: 10.1001/jamapediatrics.2013.2188	What DSM-5 could mean to children with autism and their families.	JAMA pediatrics	2013	Neal Halfon, Alice A Kuo		The American Psychiatric Association will update its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to its fifth edition (DSM-5). With this new edition, the classification and diagnostic criteria for the spectrum of autistic disorders will change and become more specific and potentially more restrictive. Rather than maintaining several subcategories of autism including Asperger syndrome, there will be one new category called autism spectrum disorder. This change may alter which children are diagnosed as having autism as well as modify eligibility for treatment, educational, and other support services. We review the history and rationale for the proposed changes as well as several recent studies that have attempted to gauge the impact of these changes on children and families. We also consider how the proposed changes are likely to create new challenges for parents who are attempting to organize their children's care and for pediatricians who are providing that care and assisting with care coordination.
23644916	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1839-2	Asperger's disorder will be back.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Luke Y Tsai	Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan Medical School, 2385 Placid Way, Ann Arbor, MI, 48105, USA, lyctsai@umich.edu.	This review focuses on identifying up-to-date number of publications that compared DSM-IV/ICD-10 Asperger's disorder (AspD) to Autistic Disorder/High-functioning Autism (AD/HFA). One hundred and twenty-eight publications were identified through an extensive search of major electronic databases and journals. Based on more than 90 clinical variables been investigated, 94 publications concluded that there were statistically significant or near significant level of quantitative and/or qualitative differences between AspD and AD/HFA groups; 4 publications found both similarities and differences between the two groups; 30 publications concluded with no differences between the two groups. Although DSM-5 ASD will eliminate Asperger's disorder. However, it is plausible to predict that the field of ASD would run full circle during the next decade or two and that AspD will be back in the next edition of DSM.
23628291	doi: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2013.04.014	Autonomic arousal explains social cognitive abilities in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder.	International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology	2013	Danielle Mathersul, Skye McDonald, Jacqueline A Rushby		Empirical research into behavioural profiles and autonomic responsivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is highly variable and inconsistent. Two preliminary studies of children with ASDs suggest that there may be subgroups of ASDs depending on their resting arousal levels, and that these subgroups show different profiles of autonomic responsivity. The aim of the present study was to determine whether (i) adults with high-functioning ASDs may be separated into subgroups according to variation in resting arousal; and (ii) these ASD arousal subgroups differ in their behavioural profiles for basic emotion recognition, judgements of trustworthiness, and cognitive and affective empathy. Thirty high-functioning adults with ASDs and 34 non-clinical controls participated. Resting arousal was determined as the average skin conductance (SCL) across a 2 min resting period. There was a subgroup of ASD adults with significantly lower resting SCL. These individuals demonstrated poorer emotion recognition, tended to judge faces more negatively, and had atypical relationships between SCL and affective empathy. In contrast, low cognitive empathy was a feature of all ASD adults. These findings have important implications for clinical interventions and future studies investigating autonomic functioning in ASDs.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Jill A Hollway, Michael G Aman, Eric Butter		We explored possible cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and physiological risk markers for sleep disturbance in children with autism spectrum disorders. Data from 1,583 children in the Autism Treatment Network were analyzed. Approximately 45 potential predictors were analyzed using hierarchical regression modeling. As medication could confound findings, it was included in the analyses as a covariate. Results revealed that anxiety, autism symptom severity, sensory sensitivities, and GI problems were associated with sleep disturbance. IQ positively predicted sleep disturbance, and children with Asperger's Disorder were more vulnerable than others. The amount of variance in sleep outcomes explained by predictor variables was modest (i.e., R (2) from .104 to .201). Predictor variables were evaluated in the context of a bidirectional theoretical framework.
23613864	pii: e61493	A model of functional brain connectivity and background noise as a biomarker for cognitive phenotypes: application to autism.	PloS one	2013	Luis García Domínguez, José Luis Pérez Velázquez, Roberto Fernández Galán		We present an efficient approach to discriminate between typical and atypical brains from macroscopic neural dynamics recorded as magnetoencephalograms (MEG). Our approach is based on the fact that spontaneous brain activity can be accurately described with stochastic dynamics, as a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (mOUP). By fitting the data to a mOUP we obtain: 1) the functional connectivity matrix, corresponding to the drift operator, and 2) the traces of background stochastic activity (noise) driving the brain. We applied this method to investigate functional connectivity and background noise in juvenile patients (n = 9) with Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and compared them to age-matched juvenile control subjects (n = 10). Our analysis reveals significant alterations in both functional brain connectivity and background noise in ASD patients. The dominant connectivity change in ASD relative to control shows enhanced functional excitation from occipital to frontal areas along a parasagittal axis. Background noise in ASD patients is spatially correlated over wide areas, as opposed to control, where areas driven by correlated noise form smaller patches. An analysis of the spatial complexity reveals that it is significantly lower in ASD subjects. Although the detailed physiological mechanisms underlying these alterations cannot be determined from macroscopic brain recordings, we speculate that enhanced occipital-frontal excitation may result from changes in white matter density in ASD, as suggested in previous studies. We also venture that long-range spatial correlations in the background noise may result from less specificity (or more promiscuity) of thalamo-cortical projections. All the calculations involved in our analysis are highly efficient and outperform other algorithms to discriminate typical and atypical brains with a comparable level of accuracy. Altogether our results demonstrate a promising potential of our approach as an efficient biomarker for altered brain dynamics associated with a cognitive phenotype.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Stefano Taddei, Bastianina Contena		Autism spectrum disorders include autistic and Asperger's Syndrome (AS), often studied in terms of executive functions (EF), with controversial results. Using Planning Attention Simultaneous Successive theory (PASS; Das et al. in Assessment of cognitive processes: the PASS theory of intelligence. Allyn and Bacon, Boston, MA, 1994), this research compares the cognitive profiles obtained by the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS; Naglieri and Das in Cognitive assessment system. Riverside, Itasca, IL, 1997) of 15 subjects with typical development, 18 with autistic disorder and 20 with AS. Results highlight lower profiles for children with autistic and AS compared with typical development and even lower Planning and Attention processes for the group with autistic disorders than that with Asperger's. Subjects with Asperger's diagnosis do not differ from those with typical development as regards Simultaneous and Successive processes. Results are discussed in the light of current studies about EF.

Neuroscience	2013	B P Johnson, N J Rinehart, O White, L Millist, J Fielding		Autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) are neurodevelopmental disorders primarily characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, however motor coordination deficits are increasingly recognized as a prevalent feature of these conditions. Although it has been proposed that children with autism and AD may have difficulty utilizing visual feedback during motor learning tasks, this has not been directly examined. Significantly, changes within the cerebellum, which is implicated in motor learning, are known to be more pronounced in autism compared to AD. We used the classic double-step saccade adaptation paradigm, known to depend on cerebellar integrity, to investigate differences in motor learning and the use of visual feedback in children aged 9-14 years with high-functioning autism (HFA; IQ>80; n=10) and AD (n=13). Performance was compared to age and IQ matched typically developing children (n=12). Both HFA and AD groups successfully adapted the gain of their saccades in response to perceived visual error, however the time course for adaptation was prolonged in the HFA group. While a shift in saccade dynamics typically occurs during adaptation, we revealed aberrant changes in both HFA and AD groups. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence centrally implicating the cerebellum in ocular motor dysfunction in autism. Specifically, these findings collectively imply functional impairment of the cerebellar network and its inflow and outflow tracts that underpin saccade adaptation, with greater disturbance in HFA compared to AD.

International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology	2013	Wafaa A Kaf, Ali A Danesh		Children with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) often demonstrate auditory behaviors such as hypersensitivity to sounds and poor performance in noisy environments. These auditory behaviors may be related to cochlear dysfunction and abnormal medial olivocochlear bundle (MOCB) activity. The objective of this study was to examine the distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) with and without contralateral white noise to evaluate outer hair cell activity and MOCB activity in children with AS.

Journal of pediatric nursing	2013	Ellen Giarelli, Jean Ruttenberg, Andrea Segal		In this thematic content analysis we examined the expectations, and perceived facilitators of (referred to as bridges) and barriers to transition to community as reported by adolescents and young adults with Asperger syndrome. Participants were adolescents/young adults, ages 18-23 years were from the East Coast of the United States. Seventy percent of adolescents hoped for employment (n = 10). Thirty percent desired to find a partner and raise a family. Perceived barriers were: self-assessed behavioral problems, self-assessed associated features, other personal factors, and institutional factors. Bridges to facilitate transition were: accommodations in the community, cognitive abilities, personal qualities/strengths, and mentor's qualities.

Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Doris Adams Hill, Regina Kearley		The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder has systematically risen since Kanner's description in 1943 and Asperger's definition in 1944. An increase in numbers has met with an increase in litigation regarding autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA). Outcomes that first favored parents (2002-2004) have moved to outcomes favoring school districts. The authors update the reader on case outcomes for 2010 and discuss how pending changes in legislation and diagnostic criteria may impact navigation through the education system as individuals seek a free appropriate public education (FAPE) and placement in the least restrictive environment (LRE).

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	E Sandra Byers, Shana Nichols, Susan D Voyer		This study examined the sexual functioning of single adults (61 men, 68 women) with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome living in the community with and without prior relationship experience. Participants completed an on-line questionnaire assessing autism symptoms, psychological functioning, and various aspects of sexual functioning. In general participants reported positive sexual functioning. Participants without prior relationship experience were significantly younger and more likely to be male and identify as heterosexual. They reported significantly higher sexual anxiety, lower sexual arousability, lower dyadic desire, and fewer positive sexual cognitions. The men reported better sexual function than did the women in a number of areas. These results counter negative societal perceptions about the sexuality of high functioning individuals on the autism spectrum.

Cognitive neuropsychology	2012	Mila Vulchanova, Joel B Talcott, Valentin Vulchanov, Margarita Stankova, Hendrik Eshuis		We conducted a detailed study of a case of linguistic talent in the context of autism spectrum disorder, specifically Asperger syndrome. I.A. displays language strengths at the level of morphology and syntax. Yet, despite this grammar advantage, processing of figurative language and inferencing based on context presents a problem for him. The morphology advantage for I.A. is consistent with the weak central coherence (WCC) account of autism. From this account, the presence of a local processing bias is evident in the ways in which autistic individuals solve common problems, such as assessing similarities between objects and finding common patterns, and may therefore provide an advantage in some cognitive tasks compared to typical individuals. We extend the WCC account to language and provide evidence for a connection between the local processing bias and the acquisition of morphology and grammar.

We investigated whether ASD diagnostic outcome varied when DSM-5 was used compared to ICD-10R and DSM-IV-TR in a clinical sample of 150 intellectually able adults. Of those diagnosed with an ASD using ICD-10R, 56 % met DSM-5 ASD criteria. A further 19 % met DSM-5 (draft) criteria for Social Communication Disorder. Of those diagnosed with Autistic Disorder/Asperger Syndrome on DSM-IV-TR, 78 % met DSM-5 ASD criteria. Sensitivity of DSM-5 was significantly increased by reducing the number of criteria required for a DSM-5 diagnosis, or by rating 'uncertain' criteria as 'present', without sacrificing specificity. Reduced rates of ASD diagnosis may mean some ASD individuals will be unable to access clinical services.

Developmental cognitive neuroscience	2013	Anne Hauswald, Nathan Weisz, Shlomo Bentin, Johanna Kissler		"Children with Asperger's syndrome show deficits in social functioning while their intellectual and language development is intact suggesting a specific dysfunction in mechanisms mediating social cognition. An action observation/execution matching system might be one such mechanism. Recent studies indeed showed that electrophysiological modulation of the ""Mu-rhythm"" in the 10-12Hz range is weaker when individuals with Asperger's syndrome observe actions performed by others compared to controls. However, electrophysiological studies typically fall short in revealing the neural generators of this activity. To fill this gap we assessed magnetoencephalographic Mu-modulations in Asperger's and typically developed children, while observing grasping movements. Mu-power increased at frontal and central sensors during movement observation. This modulation was stronger in typical than in Asperger children. Source localization revealed stronger sources in premotor cortex, the intraparietal lobule (IPL) and the mid-occipito-temporal gyrus (MOTG) and weaker sources in prefrontal cortex in typical participants compared to Asperger. Activity in premotor regions, IPL and MOTG correlated positively with social competence, whereas prefrontal Mu-sources correlated negatively with social competence. No correlation with intellectual ability was found at any of these sites. These findings localize abnormal Mu-activity in the brain of Asperger children providing evidence which associates motor-system abnormalities with social-function deficits."

Neural regeneration research	2013	Selina Mårdh	Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI), Linköping 58195, Sweden ; Department of Behaviour and Learning, Linköping University, Linköping 58183, Sweden.	Central coherence refers to the ability to interpret details of information into a whole. To date, the concept of central coherence is mainly used in research of autism, Asperger's syndrome and recently in the research on eating disorders. The main purpose of the present study was to examine central coherence in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Nine Alzheimer's disease patients and ten age- and gender-matched control subjects, who differed significantly in neurological assessment, were shown a picture of a fire. Compared to control subjects, the Alzheimer's disease patients described the picture in a fragmented way by mentioning details and separate objects without perceiving the context of the fire. In conclusion, patients with Alzheimer's disease are at the weak end of central coherence, and hence suffer from a fragmented view of their surroundings. The findings have important clinical implications for the understanding of patients with Alzheimer's diseaseand also for the possibility of caregivers to meet the Alzheimer's disease individual in an appropriate way in the everyday care.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Felicity Butterly, Carol Percy, Gillian Ward		The aim of this study was to identify the outcomes expected and assessed by those providing service dogs to children with developmental disabilities. Seventeen registered service dog providers were invited to complete a mixed methods online survey. Five providers, who prepared dogs to work with a wide range of conditions and behaviours, mainly Asperger's syndrome, autism and communication disorders, completed the survey. All five participants reported that they expected to see positive changes as a consequence of the service dog placement, in both the recipient child and their family, including improvements in attention span and language skills, as well as increased familial cohesion. Survey responses indicated that not all desired outcomes were routinely assessed. The range of assessments used were interviews, intake conversations, pre-placement questionnaires, child social diaries filled in by parents, follow up surveys after placement, and child observation by parents. No specifically named valid and reliable clinical or research measures were referred to, showing an emphasis on assessments from parents and service dog providers. It is not clear whether pre-intervention assessments are repeated systematically at follow-up, which could show robust intervention effects. There is scope for professionals in developmental disability to work with service dog providers to improve the evidence base in this field.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Katja M Lampi, Susanna Hinkka-Yli-Salomäki, Venla Lehti, Hans Helenius, Mika Gissler, Alan S Brown, Andre Sourander		Aim of the study was to examine the associations between parental age and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Data were based on the FIPS-A (Finnish Prenatal Study of Autism and Autism Spectrum Disorders), a case-control study with a total of 4,713 cases with childhood autism (n = 1,132), Asperger's syndrome (n = 1,785) or other pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) (n = 1,796), which were ascertained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Controls were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. Advanced paternal age (35-49 years) was associated with childhood autism in offspring, whereas advanced maternal age was associated with both Asperger's syndrome and PDD in offspring (35 years or more and 40 years or more, respectively). Teenage motherhood (19 years or less) was associated with PDD in offspring. The main finding was that maternal and paternal ages were differentially associated with ASD subtypes. In addition to advanced parental age, teenage pregnancy seems to incur a risk for PDD in offspring.
23478362	doi: 10.3233/WOR-131590	Job support by occupational therapists for people with developmental disabilities: two case studies.	Work (Reading, Mass.)	2013	Mayumi Arikawa, Hideki Goto, Kazuhito Mineno		The present report uses two cases to provide an overview of employment support by occupational therapists for people with developmental disabilities and investigates the roles occupational therapists should play and the support they should give. Case A was a man in his 30s with Asperger disorder who used a trial employment program and received on-the-job training, leading to regular employment. Case B was a man in his 40s with intellectual disability who used outreach supported employment and achieved financial stability through sheltered employment. These two cases suggest that occupational therapists can help people with developmental disabilities acquire stable employment by accelerating their adaptation to the workplace through the following steps: assessing the occupational performance of the individual and the work environment; understanding the characteristics of the job by experiencing the job first-hand; and adjusting or improving the work environment to match the capabilities of the individual.

The stability over time of a diagnosis of ASD is theoretically interesting and important for various diagnostic and clinical reasons. We studied the diagnostic stability of ASD from childhood to early adulthood in the Faroe Islands: a total school age population sample (8-17-year-olds) was screened and diagnostically assessed for AD in 2002 and 2009. This paper compares both independent clinical diagnosis and Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) algorithm diagnosis at two time points, separated by seven years. The stability of clinical ASD diagnosis was perfect for AD, good for ""atypical autism""/PDD-NOS, and less than perfect for Asperger syndrome (AS). Stability of the DISCO algorithm subcategory diagnoses was more variable but still good for AD. Both systems showed excellent stability over the seven-year period for ""any ASD"" diagnosis, although a number of clear cases had been missed at the original screening in 2002. The findings support the notion that subcategories of ASD should be collapsed into one overarching diagnostic entity with subgrouping achieved on other ""non-autism"" variables, such as IQ and language levels and overall adaptive functioning."

Maternal and child health journal	2013	Roy Grant, Molly Nozyce		"The American Psychiatric Association has revised the diagnostic criteria for their DSM-5 manual. Important changes have been made to the diagnosis of the current (DSM-IV) category of Pervasive Developmental Disorders. This category includes Autistic Disorder (autism), Asperger's Disorder, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). The DSM-5 deletes Asperger's Disorder and PDD-NOS as diagnostic entities. This change may have unintended consequences, including the possibility that the new diagnostic framework will adversely affect access to developmental interventions under Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) programs, Early Intervention (for birth to 2 years olds) and preschool special education (for 3 and 4 years olds). Changing the current diagnosis of PDD-NOS to a ""Social Communication Disorder"" focused on language pragmatics in the DSM-5 may restrict eligibility for IDEA programs and limit the scope of services for affected children. Young children who meet current criteria for PDD-NOS require more intensive and multi-disciplinary services than would be available with a communication domain diagnosis and possible service authorization limited to speech-language therapy. Intensive behavioral interventions, inclusive group setting placements, and family support services are typically more available for children with an autism spectrum disorder than with diagnoses reflecting speech-language delay. The diagnostic distinction reflective of the higher language and social functioning between Asperger's Disorder and autism is also undermined by eliminating the former as a categorical diagnosis and subsuming it under autism. This change may adversely affect treatment planning and misinform parents about prognosis for children who meet current criteria for Asperger's Disorder."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Eric A Storch, Michael L Sulkowski, Josh Nadeau, Adam B Lewin, Elysse B Arnold, P Jane Mutch, Anna M Jones, Tanya K Murphy		This study investigated the phenomenology and clinical correlates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth with ASD (N = 102; range 7-16 years). The presence of suicidal thoughts and behavior was assessed through the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule-Child and Parent Versions. Children and parents completed measures of anxiety severity, functional impairment, and behavioral and emotional problems. Approximately 11 % of youth displayed suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Children with autism were more likely to have suicidal thoughts and behaviors whereas children with Asperger's disorder were less likely. Suicidal thoughts and behaviors were associated with the presence of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Overall, results suggest that suicidal thoughts and behaviors are common in youth with ASD, and may be related to depression and trauma.

23446714		[Empathy, social cognition and autism spectrum disorders].	Revista de neurologia	2013	Victor L Ruggieri	Servicio de Neurología, Hospital de Pediatría J.P. Garrahan, Buenos Aires, Argentina. victorruggieri@gmail.com	From their earliest reports, Kanner and Asperger included the hierarchy of difficulties in socialisation as one of the key axes in persons affected with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), associated to development delay or language disorders and restricted interests. This deficiency in social cognition has been related with a deficit in empathy. The theory of deficit in empathising and hypersystematisation provides a coherent, comprehensible explanation with which to partially understand the genesis of these disorders. Empathy is an essential component for emotional experiencing and social interaction, and denotes an affective response to mental states that are either perceived directly or imagined or are feelings inferred by another person. It enables us to understand, feel and respond appropriately to social stimuli, thereby giving rise to an adequate socialisation. Empathy has been considered a synonym of emotional contagion, mimicry, sympathy, compassion and empathic interest. Although these are concepts that are related and necessary for the development of adequate social cognition, they are not the same; nonetheless, they are all essential for the development of empathy or its consequences. Empathy allows individuals to 'feel with', whereas sympathy, compassion and empathic interest are related with 'feeling for' or feeling what is appropriate. Studies conducted in persons with ASD have shown them to have a low empathy quotient. In this work, different aspects of empathy, its components, its neurobiological foundations, the manifestations related with its deficit and its relation with the development of ASDs are all analysed.

23417137	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2013.01.013	Relationship between poor sleep and daytime cognitive performance in young adults with autism.	Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Élyse Limoges, Christianne Bolduc, Claude Berthiaume, Laurent Mottron, Roger Godbout		Poor sleep is a common feature in autism even though patients themselves do not necessarily complain. The impact of poor sleep on daytime cognitive functioning in autism is not well-known and we therefore investigated whether sleep in autism correlates with daytime cognitive performance. A battery of non-verbal tasks was administered, in the morning after a second night of sleep in the laboratory, to 17 young adults with autism and normal intelligence, and 14 typically developed individuals matched for age and IQ; none of the participants complained about sleep problems. Two dimensions of attention (sustained and selective) and 4 types of memory (working, declarative, sensory-motor and cognitive procedural) were tested. Individuals with autism showed clear signs of poor sleep. Their performance differed from the controls in response speed but not in accuracy. Signs of poor sleep in the autism group were significantly correlated with either normal performance (selective attention and declarative memory) or performance inferior to that of the controls (sensory-motor and cognitive procedural memories). Both groups presented a significant negative correlation between slow-wave sleep (SWS) and learning a sensory-motor procedural memory task. Only control participants showed a positive association between SWS duration and number of figures recalled on the declarative memory task. Correlation patterns differed between groups when sleep spindles were considered: they were negatively associated with number of trials needed to learn the sensory-motor procedural memory task in autism and with reaction time and number of errors on selective attention in the controls. Correlation between rapid eye movements (REMs) in REM sleep and cognitive procedural memory was not significant. We conclude that some signs reflecting the presence of poor sleep in adults with high-functioning autism correlate with various aspects of motor output on non-verbal performance tasks. The question is raised whether poor sleep in non-complaining persons with autism should be treated.
23417136	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2013.01.009	Demands in reflecting about another's motives and intentions modulate vicarious embarrassment in autism spectrum disorders.	Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Frieder M Paulus, Inge Kamp-Becker, Sören Krach		The affective responses to another person's condition depend on the ability to reflect about another's thoughts and intentions. This is relevant also for high-functioning individuals with ASD who have considerable difficulties in reading the intentions of others. With the present study we introduce a novel paradigm to induce vicarious embarrassment as a form of social pain. We predicted that the vicarious embarrassment experiences of high-functioning individuals with ASD should specifically decline in social contexts that require reflecting on another's intentions. Thirty-two young adults with high-functioning ASD were matched with regards to age, gender, and verbal IQ to a control group. Vicarious embarrassment was examined with previously validated stimuli describing 30 situations that elicit vicarious embarrassment in the observer. The situations manipulated whether the displayed protagonist either accidentally or intentionally transgressed a social norm in public and participants rated their vicarious embarrassment from the observer's perspective. The ASD group showed comparable vicarious embarrassment experience in response to observing another's accidental norm transgressions but significantly reduced vicarious embarrassment when observing another who intentionally violated socials norms. Vicarious embarrassment was significantly correlated with trait empathy in the ASD group. In complex social scenarios individuals with ASD are impaired in reporting experience of vicarious embarrassment, primarily when it is required to reflect on another's intentions. The present study thus contributes to a better understanding of how persons with ASD are affected in the diversity of empathic processes in the social, everyday life environment they are embedded in.

The cohort includes 4713 children born between 1987 and 2005 with diagnoses of childhood autism, Asperger's syndrome or PDD-NOS. Cases were ascertained from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register, and each was matched to four controls by gender, date of birth, place of birth, and residence in Finland. Controls were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Parents were identified through the Finnish Medical Birth Register and Finnish Central Population Register. Parental psychiatric diagnoses from inpatient care were collected from the Finnish Hospital Discharge Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used to assess whether parents' psychiatric disorders predicted ASD after controlling for parents' age, smoking during pregnancy and weight for gestational age. In summary, parental schizophrenia spectrum disorders and affective disorders were associated with the risk of ASD regardless of the subgroup. PDD-NOS was associated with all parental psychiatric disorders investigated. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings. These results may facilitate the investigation of shared genetic and familial factors between ASD and other psychiatric disorders.
23390428		Theory of Mind, Language and Adaptive Functioning in ASD: A Neuroconstructivist Perspective.	Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry = Journal de l'Academie canadienne de psychiatrie de l'enfant et de l'adolescent	2013	Teresa Ann Bennett, Peter Szatmari, Susan Bryson, Eric Duku, Liezanne Vaccarella, Larry Tuff		Neuroconstructivist theories of development highlight the potential effect one developmental domain may have on constraining or facilitating another. Empirical validation of this theory requires further testing in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), and may illuminate the complex interplay of developmental trajectories, particularly in the relationship between predictor and outcome variables. In ASD, language ability is an early predictor of important functional outcomes such as communication and socialization. We aimed to investigate whether theory of mind (ToM) mediates the relation between language ability and adaptive functioning in more cognitively able children with ASD (IQ > 70).

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Terje Falck-Ytter, Claes von Hofsten, Christopher Gillberg, Elisabeth Fernell		Looking at other children's interactions provides rich learning opportunities for a small child. How children with autism look at other children is largely unknown. Using eye tracking, we studied gaze performance in children with autism and neurotypical comparison children while they were watching videos of semi-naturalistic social interactions between young children. Using a novel, bottom-up approach we identified event-related measures that distinguished between groups with high accuracy. The observed effects remained in a subset of the total sample matched on IQ, and were replicated across several different stimuli. The described method facilitates the detection of meaningful patterns in complex eye tracking data. Also, the approach significantly improves visualization, which will help investigators understand, illustrate, and generate new hypotheses.
23371506	doi: 10.1007/s10803-013-1760-8	Recognition of facial expressions and prosodic cues with graded emotional intensities in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Hirokazu Doi, Takashi X Fujisawa, Chieko Kanai, Haruhisa Ohta, Hideki Yokoi, Akira Iwanami, Nobumasa Kato, Kazuyuki Shinohara		This study investigated the ability of adults with Asperger syndrome to recognize emotional categories of facial expressions and emotional prosodies with graded emotional intensities. The individuals with Asperger syndrome showed poorer recognition performance for angry and sad expressions from both facial and vocal information. The group difference in facial expression recognition was prominent for stimuli with low or intermediate emotional intensities. In contrast to this, the individuals with Asperger syndrome exhibited lower recognition accuracy than typically-developed controls mainly for emotional prosody with high emotional intensity. In facial expression recognition, Asperger and control groups showed an inversion effect for all categories. The magnitude of this effect was less in the Asperger group for angry and sad expressions, presumably attributable to reduced recruitment of the configural mode of face processing. The individuals with Asperger syndrome outperformed the control participants in recognizing inverted sad expressions, indicating enhanced processing of local facial information representing sad emotion. These results suggest that the adults with Asperger syndrome rely on modality-specific strategies in emotion recognition from facial expression and prosodic information.

23335906	pii: 605	Growing Up with Asperger's Syndrome: Developmental Trajectory of Autobiographical Memory.	Frontiers in psychology	2012	Laetitia Bon, Jean-Marc Baleyte, Pascale Piolino, Béatrice Desgranges, Francis Eustache, Bérengère Guillery-Girard		"Autobiographical memory (AM) and social cognition share common properties and both are affected in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). So far, most of the scant research in ASD has concerned adults, systematically reporting impairment of the episodic component. The only study to be conducted with children concluded that they have poorer personal semantic knowledge than typical developing children. The present study explores the development of both components of AM in an 8-year-old boy diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, based on three examinations in 2007, 2008, and 2010. On each occasion, he underwent a general neuropsychological assessment including theory of mind (ToM) tasks, and a specially designed AM task allowing us to test both the semantic and the episodic components for three lifetime periods (current year, previous year, and earlier years). We observed difficulties in strategic retrieval and ToM, with a significant improvement between the second and third examinations. Regarding AM, different patterns of performance were noted in all three examinations: (1) relative preservation of current year personal knowledge, but impairment for the previous and earlier years, and (2) impairment of episodic memory for the current and previous year, but performances similar to those of controls for the earlier years. The first pattern can be explained by abnormal forgetting and by the semanticization mechanism, which needs verbal communication and social interaction to be efficient. The second pattern suggests that the development of episodic memory only reached the stage of ""event memory."" This term refers to memory for personal events lacking in details or spatiotemporal specificity, and is usually observed in children younger than five. We conclude that the abnormal functioning of social cognition in ASD, encompassing social, and personal points of view, has an impact on both components of AM."
23334404	doi: 10.1007/s11019-013-9464-6	Human capabilities, mild autism, deafness and the morality of embryo selection.	Medicine, health care, and philosophy	2013	Pier Jaarsma, Stellan Welin		A preimplantation genetic test to discriminate between severe and mild autism spectrum disorder might be developed in the foreseeable future. Recently, the philosophers Julian Savulescu and Guy Kahane claimed that there are strong reasons for prospective parents to make use of such a test to prevent the birth of children who are disposed to autism or Asperger's disorder. In this paper we will criticize this claim. We will discuss the morality of selection for mild autism in embryo selection in a hypothetical in vitro fertilization (IVF) situation where preimplantation genetic diagnosis is performed and compare this with a similar selection for congenital deafness. To do this we first discuss relevant human differences. We then introduce the principle of human capabilities (PC) and compare this principle with the principle of procreative beneficence (PB) introduced by Savulescu and Kahane. We apply the two principles to selection for mild autism and selection for congenital deafness. We argue that PC allows for the selection for mild autism but rules out selection for congenital deafness. PB will not give clear answers; the ruling of PB depends to a large extent on expected social, cultural and political developments. We will argue that PC is preferable to PB. We will discuss arguments for the value of mild autism for individuals who have this condition and argue that they are able to lead a life with human dignity provided autism-friendly social circumstances are present. Neither PC nor PB yields strong reasons for prospective parents to seek to prevent the birth of children who are disposed to mild autism spectrum disorder.
23333905	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.01.005	Marked selective impairment in autism on an index of magnocellular function.	Neuropsychologia	2013	R Greenaway, G Davis, K Plaisted-Grant		Atypical high-level vision in autism is sometimes attributed to a core deficit in the function of lateral geniculate nucleus magnocells or their retinal drives. While some physiological measures provide indirect, suggestive evidence for such a deficit, support from behavioural measures is lacking and contradictory. We assessed luminance contrast increment thresholds on pulsed- and steady- pedestals in 17 children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) compared to 17 typically developing children; these two conditions correspond to widely-used indices of magnocellular and parvocellular function. As a group, children with ASC had strikingly elevated thresholds on the steady pedestal-paradigm, yet performed similarly to controls on the pulsed pedestal paradigm, a finding that would typically be interpreted to reflect impaired magnocellular function. The effect size of the impairment was large and a substantial minority (41.2%) of the ASC group showed significantly impaired performance on an individual basis. This finding is consistent with a selective magnocellular deficit. It directly contradicts previous claims that such deficits are confined to 'complex' visual stimuli and likely does not reflect atypical attention, adaptation or high-level vision. The pattern of results is not clearly predicted by notions of imbalance of excitation versus inhibition, atypical lateral connectivity or enhanced perceptual function that account for a range of other findings associated with perception in autism. It may be amenable to explanation in terms of decreased endogenous neural noise, a novel alternative we outline here.

The American journal of orthopsychiatry	2013	Frederick L Coolidge, Peter D Marle, Camille S Rhoades, Patricia Monaghan, Daniel L Segal		This article presents preliminary psychometric properties of a new 45-item scale, the Coolidge Autistic Symptoms Survey (CASS), designed to differentiate between children within the autism spectrum (including Asperger's Disorder) and purportedly normal children, in anticipation of DSM-5 changes, in which a single diagnostic category is proposed: autism spectrum disorder. The final sample (N = 72) consisted of 19 children diagnosed with Asperger's Disorder, 19 children who were considered loners by their parents (without an autism diagnosis), and 34 purportedly normal children. The CASS and the 200-item, DSM-IV-TR aligned, Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory were completed by a parent. The CASS had excellent internal scale reliability (α= .97) and test-retest (r = .91) reliability. ANOVA revealed the CASS was able to discriminate significantly among the 3 groups of children. Further research with the CASS appears warranted.

Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)	2014	Elisabeth A H von dem Hagen, Raliza S Stoyanova, James B Rowe, Simon Baron-Cohen, Andrew J Calder		"Eye contact plays a key role in social interaction and is frequently reported to be atypical in individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs). Despite the importance of direct gaze, previous functional magnetic resonance imaging in ASC has generally focused on paradigms using averted gaze. The current study sought to determine the neural processing of faces displaying direct and averted gaze in 18 males with ASC and 23 matched controls. Controls showed an increased response to direct gaze in brain areas implicated in theory-of-mind and gaze perception, including medial prefrontal cortex, temporoparietal junction, posterior superior temporal sulcus region, and amygdala. In contrast, the same regions showed an increased response to averted gaze in individuals with an ASC. This difference was confirmed by a significant gaze direction × group interaction. Relative to controls, participants with ASC also showed reduced functional connectivity between these regions. We suggest that, in the typical brain, perceiving another person gazing directly at you triggers spontaneous attributions of mental states (e.g. he is ""interested"" in me), and that such mental state attributions to direct gaze may be reduced or absent in the autistic brain."

Scandinavian journal of occupational therapy	2013	Ingrid Breivik, Helena Hemmingsson		Adolescents with Asperger's syndrome (AS), often have handwriting difficulties that affect their academic performance. The purpose of this descriptive multiple-case mixed-method study was to highlight how adolescents with AS experience writing in the school setting when writing by hand and when using a computerized Assistive Technology Device (ATD), for writing. A qualitative content analysis approach was used, including interviews with five adolescents, their parents, and their teachers. This was complemented by asking the adolescents to rate their perceived performance and satisfaction of writing with and without the ATD. All adolescents described handwriting difficulties, but a reduced ability to express oneself in writing was also common. Initiating and completing writing tasks was often so demanding that it caused resistance to the activity. Several advantages when using the ATD were described by the participants and the self-ratings showed higher scores for performance of and satisfaction with writing when the ATD was used. The results show that teachers' encouragement seemed to be important for the initiation and continuation of use of the ATD.

24697041		Neurofeedback therapy in patients with non pain syndromes of chronic and paroxysmal character-literature review and own experience.	Przeglad lekarski	2013	Alicja Kubik, Marek Kaciński		Neurofeedback has been used in treatment of many other than pain clinical syndromes. This group includes chronic as well as paroxysmal syndromes previously treated pharmacologically. However due to non satisfactory results of this treatment introduction of non-pharmacological therapy has been examined. Observations from our 9-year experience of neurofeedback therapy used in children and adult patients with epilepsy, Asperger syndrome, depression, neurosis, personality disorders, drug addiction and other (not pain) syndromes have been presented in this paper. Positive influence of neurofeedback therapy on symptoms intensity, frequency, duration and social relations of treated patients has been confirmed by our own and other authors observations. Neurofeedback therapy has been tried by patients with other difficult life problems and has been effective in some of them. The effectiveness of the therapy has been confirmed by patients, their relatives and also by neurophysiological results. Additionally, preliminary results of neurofeedback therapy used in management of computer addiction in children and adolescents have been presented herein.

23266067	doi: 10.1016/j.schres.2012.12.001	Social cognition impairments in Asperger syndrome and schizophrenia.	Schizophrenia research	2013	Tove Lugnegård, Maria Unenge Hallerbäck, Fredrik Hjärthag, Christopher Gillberg		Social cognition impairments are well described in both autism spectrum disorders, including Asperger syndrome (AS), and in schizophrenia spectrum disorders. However, little is known about whether there are differences between the two groups of disorders regarding this ability. The aim of this study was to compare social cognition abilities in AS and schizophrenia. Fifty-three individuals (26 men, 27 women) with a clinical diagnosis of AS, 36 (22 men, 14 women) with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenic psychosis, and 50 non-clinical controls (19 men, 31 women) participated in the study. Clinical diagnoses were confirmed either by Structured Clinical Interview on DSM-IV diagnosis or the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders. Verbal ability was assessed using the Vocabulary subtest of the WAIS-III. Two social cognition instruments were used: Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (Eyes Test) and the Animations Task. On the Eyes Test, patients with schizophrenia showed poorer results compared to non-clinical controls; however, no other group differences were seen. Both clinical groups scored significantly lower than the comparison group on the Animations Task. The AS group performed somewhat better than the schizophrenia group. Some differences were accounted for by gender effects. Implicit social cognition impairments appear to be at least as severe in schizophrenia as they are in AS. Possible gender differences have to be taken into account in future research on this topic.

23234194		[Psychoanalytic study of social withdrawal: grandiose narcissism and passive aggression due to insufficient maternal containing in childhood].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2012	Toyoaki Ogawa	Department of Psychopathology & Psychotherapy, Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya University.	"Two different types of pathology can cause social withdrawal: the narcissistic--schizoid personality organization (NSPO) type and the mild Asperger's syndrome (mild developmental disorders) type. Only the former type can be treated by psychoanalytic psychotherapy. In the childhood of both types, one may find traumatic family environments which will result in social withdrawal (Hikikomori). In the infancy of the NSPO type, the mother fails to function as a sufficient container of the child's emotion, which encourages formation of a schizoid personality organization i.e. the psychic withdrawal (or ""psychic retreat"" by Steiner, J.). With only a little failure in life events, this may turn into a physical withdrawal for a long time. And in this type of pathology their aggression takes a passive form that hardens their social withdrawal situation. Moreover, the social withdrawal itself serves to reinforce the pathological narcissism."
23233478		The implications of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 for residency training program administration.	The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law	2012	Alexandra Regenbogen, Patricia R Recupero		The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is rarely invoked by medical residents in training. Dr. Martin Jakubowski, a family medicine resident with Asperger's disorder, was dismissed for communicating poorly with patients, peers, and supervisors and for issuing dangerous medical orders. In an attempt to become reinstated, he sued under the ADA (Jakubowski v. The Christ Hospital), arguing that the program had failed to make reasonable accommodation for his disability. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the hospital, finding that although the doctor was disabled under the ADA, he had failed to demonstrate that he was otherwise qualified for the position. This article comments on the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) guidelines from 2011 and their application to medical residency training, and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies as essential job functions.
23233021	doi: 10.1038/tp.2012.124	A randomised controlled trial of bumetanide in the treatment of autism in children.	Translational psychiatry	2012	E Lemonnier, C Degrez, M Phelep, R Tyzio, F Josse, M Grandgeorge, N Hadjikhani, Y Ben-Ari		Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synapses and the oscillations they orchestrate are altered in autism. GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean ± s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism. Larger trials are warranted to better determine the population best suited for this treatment.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Kirstin Greaves-Lord, Mart L J M Eussen, Frank C Verhulst, Ruud B Minderaa, William Mandy, James J Hudziak, Mark Peter Steenhuis, Pieter F de Nijs, Catharina A Hartman		This study aimed to contribute to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) debates on the conceptualization of autism by investigating (1) whether empirically based distinct phenotypic profiles could be distinguished within a sample of mainly cognitively able children with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), and (2) how profiles related to diagnoses and co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems. Six classes with distinct profiles were discerned. Three classes showed profiles not completely in line with the proposed DSM-5 conceptualization of autism. These classes included relatively many cognitively able individuals with PDD-not otherwise specified. However, profiles seemed to suit other diagnostic categories, such as social communication disorder. These alternative diagnoses could retain eligibility for services, and might adequately fit more specifically targeted interventions.

23220737	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2012.11.009	Cognitive variability in adults with ADHD and AS: disentangling the roles of executive functions and social cognition.	Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Maria Luz Gonzalez-Gadea, Sandra Baez, Teresa Torralva, Francisco Xavier Castellanos, Alexia Rattazzi, Victoria Bein, Katharina Rogg, Facundo Manes, Agustin Ibanez		Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Asperger's Syndrome (AS) share a heterogeneous cognitive profile. Studies assessing executive functions (EF) and social cognition in both groups have found preserved and impaired performances. These inconsistent findings would be partially explained by the cognitive variability reported in these disorders. First, the present study explored the inter-individual variability in EF and social cognition in both patient groups. Second, we compared differential characteristics and commonalities in the cognitive profiles of EF and social cognition between ADHD, AS and control adults. We assessed 22 patients with ADHD, 23 adults with AS and 21 matched typically developing subjects using different measures of EF (working memory, cognitive flexibility and multitasking) and social cognition (theory of mind and decision-making). Group comparisons and multiple case series analyses (MCSA) were conducted. The between-group comparisons showed an EF deficit in working memory in ADHD and a theory of mind (ToM) impairment in AS. The MCSA evidenced that, compared to controls, ADHD patients had a higher inter-individual variability in EF, while individuals with AS had a more heterogeneous profile in social cognition tasks compared to both groups. Finally, the AS and ADHD groups presented higher task-related variability compared to controls and shared a common heterogeneous profile in EF. This is the first study to compare variability in EF and social cognition profiles of ADHD and AS. We propose that heterogeneity in EF performance is a link between ADHD and AS which may explain the overlap of symptomatology between both diagnoses. In addition, patients with AS seem to show a unique heterogeneous profile in ToM which may explain the low probability of finding AS symptoms in patients with ADHD.

International journal of speech-language pathology	2013	Tiffany L Hutchins, Patricia A Prelock		This study examines the social validity of a family-centred collaborative approach to developing Social Stories™ to support the behavioural and communicative functioning of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty children with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD)/Autism, PDD-Not Otherwise Specified, or Asperger's Disorder (aged 4-12 years) participated in a multiple baseline design across behaviours with a 6-week follow-up. The effects of behaviour stories (to reduce problem behaviours) and communication stories (to facilitate communication) as assessed by parental subjective perceptions of child functioning were evaluated and compared. Using daily parental ratings, behaviour stories were deemed effective for 11 of 17 stories (64.7%), whereas communication stories were deemed effective for 10 of 19 stories (52.6%), with great variability in effect size for both. Results also indicated variability in performance across specific story targets, although parents' perceived effects of Social Stories™ were not linked to any known child characteristics. This study argues that intervention using Social Stories™ to address behavioural and communicative functioning can yield socially valid outcomes across a range of child characteristics and intervention targets. Implications for clinical practice and how present methodological limitations can be addressed in future research are considered.

Although many of these medications have been demonstrated to be useful, no clear primary treatment for PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder has emerged. Despite the efficacy of some of the medicines, the acceptability and side effects have proven to be barriers to their use. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Japanese herbal medicine yokukansan (TJ-54) may be safe and useful in treating behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia and some neuropsychiatric disorders. We aimed at evaluating both the efficacy and safety of TJ-54 in patients with well-defined PDD-NOS and Asperger's disorder.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Dorothea L Floris, Lindsay R Chura, Rosemary J Holt, John Suckling, Edward T Bullmore, Simon Baron-Cohen, Michael D Spencer		Rightward cerebral lateralization has been suggested to be involved in the neuropathology of autism spectrum conditions. We investigated functional and neuroanatomical asymmetry, in terms of handedness and corpus callosum measurements in male adolescents with autism, their unaffected siblings and controls, and their associations with executive dysfunction and symptom severity. Adolescents with autism did not differ from controls in functional asymmetry, but neuroanatomically showed the expected pattern of stronger rightward lateralization in the posterior and anterior midbody based on their hand-preference. Measures of symptom severity were related to rightward asymmetry in three subregions (splenium, posterior midbody and rostral body). We found the opposite pattern for the isthmus and rostrum with better cognitive and less severe clinical scores associated with rightward lateralization.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	John P Doody, Peter Bull		While most studies of emotion recognition in Asperger's Syndrome (AS) have focused solely on the verbal decoding of affective states, the current research employed the novel technique of using both nonverbal matching and verbal labeling tasks to examine the decoding of emotional body postures and facial expressions. AS participants performed as accurately as controls at matching fear body postures, but were significantly less accurate than controls verbally identifying these same stimuli. This profile arguably indicates that that while the AS participants were aware that the fear body posture stimuli represented a distinct emotion, they were unsure as to which specific emotion. In addition, the AS participants took significantly longer than the controls to respond to anger body posture stimuli on a matching task. However, in contrast to previous studies, AS and control participants did not differ significantly in their responses to facial expression stimuli, in terms of either accuracy or response times.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	David Williams, Jill Boucher, Sophie Lind, Christopher Jarrold		Prospective memory (remembering to carry out an action in the future) has been studied relatively little in ASD. We explored time-based (carry out an action at a pre-specified time) and event-based (carry out an action upon the occurrence of a pre-specified event) prospective memory, as well as possible cognitive correlates, among 21 intellectually high-functioning children with ASD, and 21 age- and IQ-matched neurotypical comparison children. We found impaired time-based, but undiminished event-based, prospective memory among children with ASD. In the ASD group, time-based prospective memory performance was associated significantly with diminished theory of mind, but not with diminished cognitive flexibility. There was no evidence that time-estimation ability contributed to time-based prospective memory impairment in ASD.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2013	Benjamin E Yerys, Ericka Ruiz, John Strang, Jennifer Sokoloff, Lauren Kenworthy, Chandan J Vaidya		The attentional blink (AB) phenomenon was used to assess the effect of emotional information on early visual attention in typically developing (TD) children and children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The AB effect is the momentary perceptual unawareness that follows target identification in a rapid serial visual processing stream. It is abolished or reduced for emotional stimuli, indicating that emotional information has privileged access to early visual attention processes.
23162607		TARGETED TREATMENTS IN AUTISM AND FRAGILE X SYNDROME.	Research in autism spectrum disorders	2012	C Kağan Gürkan, Randi J Hagerman		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder consisting of a constellation of symptoms that sometimes occur as part of a complex disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, communication and behavioral domains. It is a highly disabling disorder and there is a need for treatment targeting the core symptoms. Although autism is accepted as highly heritable, there is no genetic cure at this time. Autism is shown to be linked to several genes and is a feature of some complex genetic disorders, including fragile X syndrome (FXS), fragile X premutation involvement, tuberous sclerosis and Rett syndrome. The term autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) covers autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD-NOS) and the etiologies are heterogeneous. In recent years, targeted treatments have been developed for several disorders that have a known specific genetic cause leading to autism. Since there are significant molecular and neurobiological overlaps among disorders, targeted treatments developed for a specific disorder may be helpful in ASD of unknown etiology. Examples of this are two drug classes developed to treat FXS, Arbaclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, and mGluR5 antagonists, and both may be helpful in autism without FXS. The mGluR5 antagonists are also likely to have a benefit in the aging problems of fragile X premutation carriers, the fragile X -associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) and the Parkinsonism that can occur in aging patients with fragile X syndrome. Targeted treatments in FXS which has a well known genetic etiology may lead to new targeted treatments in autism.
23162450	pii: 302	Integrating intention and context: assessing social cognition in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2012	Sandra Baez, Alexia Rattazzi, María L Gonzalez-Gadea, Teresa Torralva, Nora Silvana Vigliecca, Jean Decety, Facundo Manes, Agustin Ibanez		Deficits in social cognition are an evident clinical feature of the Asperger syndrome (AS). Although many daily life problems of adults with AS are related to social cognition impairments, few studies have conducted comprehensive research in this area. The current study examined multiple domains of social cognition in adults with AS assessing the executive functions (EF) and exploring the intra and inter-individual variability. Fifteen adult's diagnosed with AS and 15 matched healthy controls completed a battery of social cognition tasks. This battery included measures of emotion recognition, theory of mind (ToM), empathy, moral judgment, social norms knowledge, and self-monitoring behavior in social settings. We controlled for the effect of EF and explored the individual variability. The results indicated that adults with AS had a fundamental deficit in several domains of social cognition. We also found high variability in the social cognition tasks. In these tasks, AS participants obtained mostly subnormal performance. EF did not seem to play a major role in the social cognition impairments. Our results suggest that adults with AS present a pattern of social cognition deficits characterized by the decreased ability to implicitly encode and integrate contextual information in order to access to the social meaning. Nevertheless, when social information is explicitly presented or the situation can be navigated with abstract rules, performance is improved. Our findings have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of individuals with AS as well as for the neurocognitive models of this syndrome.
23162442	pii: 99	A closer look at visually guided saccades in autism and Asperger's disorder.	Frontiers in integrative neuroscience	2012	Beth P Johnson, Nicole J Rinehart, Nicole Papadopoulos, Bruce Tonge, Lynette Millist, Owen White, Joanne Fielding		Motor impairments have been found to be a significant clinical feature associated with autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) in addition to core symptoms of communication and social cognition deficits. Motor deficits in high-functioning autism (HFA) and AD may differentiate these disorders, particularly with respect to the role of the cerebellum in motor functioning. Current neuroimaging and behavioral evidence suggests greater disruption of the cerebellum in HFA than AD. Investigations of ocular motor functioning have previously been used in clinical populations to assess the integrity of the cerebellar networks, through examination of saccade accuracy and the integrity of saccade dynamics. Previous investigations of visually guided saccades in HFA and AD have only assessed basic saccade metrics, such as latency, amplitude, and gain, as well as peak velocity. We used a simple visually guided saccade paradigm to further characterize the profile of visually guided saccade metrics and dynamics in HFA and AD. It was found that children with HFA, but not AD, were more inaccurate across both small (5°) and large (10°) target amplitudes, and final eye position was hypometric at 10°. These findings suggest greater functional disturbance of the cerebellum in HFA than AD, and suggest fundamental difficulties with visual error monitoring in HFA.

23144975	pii: e48794	The study of cognitive characteristics in Asperger's disorder by using a modified Prisoner's Dilemma game with a variable payoff matrix.	PloS one	2012	Masaya Tayama, Masaru Tateno, Tae Woo Park, Wataru Ukai, Eri Hashimoto, Toshikazu Saito		"Individuals with Asperger's Disorder (ASP) have difficulties in social reciprocity and in providing appropriate cooperative behavior. The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a well-known model in game theory that illustrates the paradoxical disposition of interaction between two individuals with opposing interests, and may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ASP in early childhood. In this study, we investigated the cognitive characteristics of ASP by using a modified PD game. The subjects were 29 individuals with ASP and 28 age- and IQ-matched controls. In the PD game, each of two players has two cards: card 1 represents cooperation and card 2 betrayal. The score each player obtains is decided according to a 2 x 2 payoff matrix and depends on the combination of their selections. The P-score (""P"" for punishment) is defined as the score that is given when they both select betrayal. Comparing the two groups, the mean P-score at the end of the game and the mean total score were significantly higher in the ASP group, while the rate of selection of cooperative choice in both groups did not differ significantly. The classification of the shape of the graph according to fluctuation of the P-score revealed that in the ASP group only 2 cases (6.9%) showed continuous decrease of P-score compared to 8 control cases (28.6%) demonstrating similar results. However, the reasons were thought to be different: ASP subjects presumably selected card 2 because of a preference for the number itself, whereas control subjects preferentially chose this card to enhance their chance of winning the competition. It is often difficult to diagnose ASP in the young especially when they lack the distinctive clinical features of ASD in early childhood. Given the limited number of objective tools to evaluate the cognitive characteristics of ASP subjects, the PD game might be a useful diagnostic support tool for ASP."
23143130	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1718-2	Views on the diagnostic labels of autism and Asperger's disorder and the proposed changes in the DSM.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Donna M Kite, Judith Gullifer, Graham A Tyson		With the approaching release of the DSM V in 2013, there has been much debate about the proposal to remove the diagnostic label of Asperger's disorder from the new DSM. This study explored how health and education professionals perceive the conditions of autism and Asperger's disorder and their views on the proposed diagnostic changes. Analysis of the 547 participant responses confirmed an increase stigma is associated with the label of autism, with autism considered to be a more severe than the condition of Asperger's disorder. Approximately half of the participants reported being opposed to proposed diagnostic changes and of the remaining participants, 22% supported the proposed changes and 28% expressed uncertainty.

Iranian journal of psychiatry	2012	Maryam Salmanian, Mehdi Tehrani-Doost, Maria Ghanbari-Motlagh, Zahra Shahrivar		Visual memory is an important cognitive ability, which has been studied in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). In such studies meaningful shapes were used more frequently. Since meaningless shapes provide a better assessment of short term visual memory, in this study we used them to evaluate visual memory in children and adolescents with ASDs compared to the normal group.

23123877	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2012.09.013	Early identification of Asperger syndrome in young children.	Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Wiebke Hoffmann, Udo König, Monika Heinzel-Gutenbrunner, Fritz Mattejat, Katja Becker, Inge Kamp-Becker		This study was designed to identify items of the ADI-R that allow an early and sensitive identification of children with possible Asperger syndrome (AS). The aim was to obtain an economic short interview suitable for screening purposes. The study was based on data from a clinical sample of 5-18-year-old children and adolescents (mean age 10.9 years) with either Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; n = 43) or AS (n = 62). The introductory questions and 36 items, which contribute to the diagnostic algorithm of the ADI-R, were subjected to content analysis and stepwise discriminant function analysis. Eight meaningful items were found, which were shown to be good predictors of AS and to discriminate between the children with AS and those with ADHD. The short interview was especially useful for the assessment and screening of children up to 11 years in our sample, because in this subgroup, sensitivity was even higher (.92) and specificity was also excellent (.90). Eight items with high discriminatory power allowed sensitive and economic screening for young children with suspected AS.
23117423	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1686-6	Brief report: CANTAB performance and brain structure in pediatric patients with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Liane Kaufmann, Sibylle Zotter, Silvia Pixner, Marc Starke, Edda Haberlandt, Maria Steinmayr-Gensluckner, Karl Egger, Michael Schocke, Elisabeth M Weiss, Josef Marksteiner		By merging neuropsychological (CANTAB/cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery) and structural brain imaging data (voxel-based-morphometry) the present study sought to identify the neurocognitive correlates of executive functions in individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) compared to healthy controls. Results disclosed subtle group differences regarding response speed on only one CANTAB subtest that is thought to tap fronto-executive network functions (SWM/spatial working memory). Across all participants, SWM performance was significantly associated with two brain regions (precentral gyrus white matter, precuneus grey matter), thus suggesting a close link between fronto-executive functions (SWM) and circumscribed fronto-parietal brain structures. Finally, symptom severity (ADOS total score) was best predicted by response speed on a set-shifting task (IES) thought to tap fronto-striatal functions (corrected R2 56%).
23114568	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1698-2	Linguistic alignment in adults with and without Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Katie E Slocombe, Ivan Alvarez, Holly P Branigan, Tjeerd Jellema, Hollie G Burnett, Anja Fischer, Yan Hei Li, Simon Garrod, Liat Levita		Individuals with Asperger's syndrome (AS) often have difficulties with social interactions and conversations. We investigated if these difficulties could be attributable to a deficit in the ability to linguistically converge with an interlocutor, which is posited to be important for successful communication. To that end, participants completed two cooperative tasks with a confederate, which allowed us to measure linguistic alignment with the confederate in terms of lexical choice, syntactic structure and spatial frame of reference. There was no difference in the performance of individuals with AS and matched controls and both groups showed significant alignment with the confederate at all three levels. We conclude that linguistic alignment is intact in adults with AS engaged in structured, goal-directed social interactions.
23104618	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1692-8	Neurocognitive functioning in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Outi Reinvall, Arja Voutilainen, Teija Kujala, Marit Korkman		There is a paucity of research studying comprehensive neurocognitive profiles of adolescents with higher functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study compared the neurocognitive profiles of higher functioning adolescents with ASD (n = 30, mean age 13.5) with that of typically developing adolescents (n = 30; mean age 13.7). Adolescents with ASD demonstrated a significantly higher mean Verbal Intelligence Quotient compared to the standardized mean. However, the ASD group had significantly lower scores than the control group on the subtests Auditory Attention and Response Set, Memory for Faces, Visuomotor Precision, and Design Copying. Thus, particular strengths were seen in verbal reasoning, while weaknesses were observed in auditory attention, facial recognition memory, and visuomotor functions in adolescents with ASD.

Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2012	Jyun Horiguchi	Department of Psychiatry, Shimane University of Medicine, 89-1 Enyacho, Izumo 6938501, Japan.	Yi-gan san (YGS, yokukan-san in Japanese) was developed in 1555 by Xue Kai as a remedy for restlessness and agitation in children. Prompted by the increasing life expectancy of the Japanese population, geriatricians have begun to use this traditional regimen for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia in the elderly. Moreover, we reported that YGS therapy is a well-tolerated and effective remedy that improves the symptoms of schizophrenia., borderline personality disorder, Charles Bonnet Syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder. Asperger's disorder, neuroleptics induced tardive dyskinesia, and restless legs syndrome. In a pilot investigation, we administered YGS as an open-label adjunct to antipsychotic medication to patients with treatment-resistant shizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, Charles Bonnet Syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, Asperger's disorder, neuroleptics induced tardive dyskinesia. The present lecture summarizes the available data based on the above our data. In addition, we extend our discussion to the potential applications of YGS for combining this treatment with cellular and molecular therapy.
23092982	doi: 10.1038/tp.2012.108	Absence of age-related prefrontal NAA change in adults with autism spectrum disorders.	Translational psychiatry	2012	Y Aoki, O Abe, N Yahata, H Kuwabara, T Natsubori, N Iwashiro, Y Takano, H Inoue, Y Kawakubo, W Gonoi, H Sasaki, M Murakami, M Katsura, Y Nippashi, H Takao, A Kunimatsu, H Matsuzaki, K J Tsuchiya, N Kato, K Kasai, H Yamasue		Atypical trajectory of brain growth in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been recognized as a potential etiology of an atypical course of behavioral development. Numerous neuroimaging studies have focused on childhood to investigate atypical age-related change of brain structure and function, because it is a period of neuron and synapse maturation. Recent studies, however, have shown that the atypical age-related structural change of autistic brain expands beyond childhood and constitutes neural underpinnings for lifelong difficulty to behavioral adaptation. Thus, we examined effects of aging on neurochemical aspects of brain maturation using 3-T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) with single voxel in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) in 24 adult men with non-medicated high-functioning ASDs and 25 age-, IQ- and parental-socioeconomic-background-matched men with typical development (TD). Multivariate analyses of covariance demonstrated significantly high N-acetylaspartate (NAA) level in the ASD subjects compared with the TD subjects (F=4.83, P=0.033). The low NAA level showed a significant positive correlation with advanced age in the TD group (r=-0.618, P=0.001), but was not evident among the ASD individuals (r=0.258, P=0.223). Fisher's r-to-z transformation showed a significant difference in the correlations between the ASD and TD groups (Z=-3.23, P=0.001), which indicated that the age-NAA relationship was significantly specific to people with TD. The current (1)H-MRS study provided new evidence that atypical age-related change of neurochemical aspects of brain maturation in ASD individuals expands beyond childhood and persists during adulthood.
23088375	doi: 10.1037/a0029984	The level and nature of autistic intelligence III: Inspection time.	Journal of abnormal psychology	2013	Elise B Barbeau, Isabelle Soulières, Michelle Dawson, Thomas A Zeffiro, Laurent Mottron		Across the autism spectrum, level of intelligence is highly dependent on the psychometric instrument used for assessment, and there are conflicting views concerning which measures best estimate autistic cognitive abilities. Inspection time is a processing speed measure associated with general intelligence in typical individuals. We therefore investigated autism spectrum performance on inspection time in relation to two different general intelligence tests. Autism spectrum individuals were divided into autistic and Asperger subgroups according to speech development history. Compared to a typical control group, mean inspection time for the autistic subgroup but not the Asperger subgroup was significantly shorter (by 31%). However, the shorter mean autistic inspection time was evident only when groups were matched on Wechsler IQ and disappeared when they were matched using Raven's Progressive Matrices. When autism spectrum abilities are compared to typical abilities, results may be influenced by speech development history as well as by the instrument used for intelligence matching.
23074034		[Autism spectrum disorder and substance use disorder: an unknown comorbidity?].	Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie	2012	S K B Singh, H Hellemans, G Dom		We describe the diagnosis and treatment of a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and substance use disorder (SUD). The patient had been given the dual diagnosis of Asperger’s disorder and SUD. On that basis the approach adopted and the treatment provided seemed appropriate. Little is known about the comorbidity of ASD and SUD and it has hardly been reported in the scientific literature or in clinical practice. Epidemiological research shows that this dual diagnosis occurs in clinical populations. A careful psychiatric diagnosis is important in order to ensure that the comorbidity is recognised at an early stage and treated in an appropriate manner.
23065028	doi: 10.1007/s00787-012-0338-x	The relationship between Asperger's syndrome and schizophrenia in adolescence.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2013	Petra Waris, Nina Lindberg, Kirsi Kettunen, Pekka Tani		Asperger's syndrome (AS), a pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), has nowadays been widely advocated in media. Therefore, psychiatrists treating adolescents frequently meet patients as well as their families reporting of symptoms resembling those of Asperger's syndrome. It is known that symptoms of Asperger's syndrome have some overlap with those of schizophrenia, but less is known about comorbidity between these two syndromes. We describe a sample of 18 adolescents with early onset schizophrenia. Diagnosis of schizophrenia was based on assessment with Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. The diagnostic interview for Social and Communication Disorders version 11 was used to assess autism spectrum disorders. Ten adolescents fulfilled symptom criteria of Asperger's syndrome after the onset of schizophrenia, while only two persons had Asperger's syndrome before the onset of schizophrenia, a prerequisite for diagnosis. 44% of the adolescents fulfilled the diagnosis of some PDD in childhood. Most of them were, however, unrecognized before the onset of schizophrenia. On the other hand, all 18 patients had one or more symptoms of PDDS in adolescence. Adolescents with schizophrenia have often symptoms consistent with AS, although only few of them have fulfilled the diagnostic criteria in their childhood, a prerequisite for the diagnosis of AS. There is a risk for misdiagnosis of adolescents with autistic symptoms if detailed longitudinal anamnesis is not obtained.

Journal of applied behavior analysis	2012	Christina F Roantree, Craig H Kennedy		We analyzed the inappropriate social interactions of 3 students with Asperger's syndrome whose behavior was maintained by social positive reinforcement. We tested whether inappropriate social behavior was sensitive to social positive reinforcement contingencies and whether such contingencies could be reversed to increase the probability of socially appropriate responding. Our results show that social positive reinforcers can be identified for inappropriate social interactions and that appropriate social behaviors can be sensitive to reinforcement contingency reversals.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Svend Erik Mouridsen, Bente Rich, Torben Isager		We performed a nationwide, register-based retrospective follow-up study of epilepsy in all people who were born between January 1, 1980 and June 29, 2006 and registered in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register with Asperger's syndrome on February 7, 2011. All 4,180 identified cases with AS (3,431 males and 749 females) were screened through the nationwide Danish National Hospital Register (DNHR) with respect to epilepsy. Mean age at follow-up was 18.1 years (range 4-31 years). Of the 4,180 individuals with AS, 164 (3.9%) were registered with at least one epilepsy diagnosis in the DNHR, which is significantly increased (p < 0.0001) relative to the same age group in the general population, where an estimate is about 2.0%.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2013	E Sandra Byers, Shana Nichols, Susan D Voyer, Georgianna Reilly		This study explored factors (gender, age, relationship status, symptomatology) associated with the sexual well-being of 141 (56 men and 85 women) adults with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS) living in the community. Participants completed an online survey consisting of a measure of autistic symptoms as well as measures of dyadic and solitary sexual well-being. Canonical correlation analyses showed that participants who were currently in a romantic relationship reported more frequent dyadic affectionate and genital activity and greater sexual assertiveness and sexual satisfaction, pointing to the importance of context in an active sex life. After controlling for the first variate, men and individuals with less autism symptomatology, particularly in the social and communication domains, generally reported significantly greater dyadic sexual well-being, including greater sexual satisfaction, assertiveness, arousability, and desire and lower sexual anxiety and fewer sexual problems. Men also reported better solitary sexual well-being, including more sexual thoughts, more sexual desire, and more frequent solitary sexual activity; however, they had lower sexual knowledge. These results highlight the importance for research and sexuality education with individuals with HFA/AS to conceptualize sexual well-being as a multidimensional construct consisting of both dyadic and solitary aspects.

ASDs have a complex multifactorial etiology, with genetic causes being recognized in only 10-20% of cases. Recently, copy-number variants (CNVs) have been shown to contribute to over 10% of ASD cases. We have applied a custom-designed oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization with an exonic coverage of over 1700 genes, including 221 genes known to cause autism and autism candidate genes, in a cohort of 145 patients with ASDs. The patients were classified according to ICD-10 standards and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale protocol into three groups consisting of 45 individuals with and 69 individuals without developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID), and 31 patients, in whom DD/ID could not be excluded. In 12 patients, we have identified 16 copy-number changes, eight (5.5%) of which likely contribute to ASDs. In addition to known recurrent CNVs such as deletions 15q11.2 (BP1-BP2) and 3q13.31 (including DRD3 and ZBTB20), and duplications 15q13.3 and 16p13.11, our analysis revealed two novel genes clinically relevant for ASDs: ARHGAP24 (4q21.23q21.3) and SLC16A7 (12q14.1). Our results further confirm the diagnostic importance of array CGH in detection of CNVs in patients with ASDs and demonstrate that CNVs are an important cause of ASDs as a heterogeneous condition with a variety of contributory genes.

23025641	doi: 10.1352/1934-9556-50.5.391	Understanding differences in neurotypical and autism spectrum special interests through Internet forums.	Intellectual and developmental disabilities	2012	Chloe Jennifer Jordan, Catherine L Caldwell-Harris		Special interests are frequently developed by individuals with autism spectrum disorder, expressed as an intense focus on specific topics. Neurotypical individuals also develop special interests, often in the form of hobbies. Although past research has focused on special interests held by children with autism spectrum disorder, little is known about their role in adulthood. The current study investigated differences in the content, number, and specificity of the special interests held by adult individuals with autism spectrum disorder and neurotypical individuals, using Internet discussion forums as a data source. Quantitative analysis of forum posts revealed significant differences between the diagnostic groups. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder reported having more interests in systemizing domains, more specific interests, and a greater number of interests overall than neurotypical individuals. Understanding special interests can lead to the development of educational and therapeutic programs that facilitate the acquirement of other important social and communication skills.
25328380		Improving Social Engagement and Initiations between Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Their Peers in Inclusive Settings.	Journal of positive behavior interventions	2012	Lynn Kern Koegel, Ty Vernon, Robert L Koegel, Brittany L Koegel, Anne W Paullin	Eli and Edythe L. Broad Center for Asperger's Research, University of California, Santa Barbara.	Children with Asperger's Disorder often have difficulty with peer relationships and socialization. The current study assessed whether peer social interactions would improve in school settings if an intervention was designed that incorporated the children with Asperger's interests. Three children who were fully-included in regular education classes but did not interact with peers prior to intervention participated in this research. Social lunch clubs, open to both the study participants and their typical peers, were implemented twice weekly during regular lunchtime periods. Results showed that all three children increased their time engaged with peers as a result of the clubs. While their initiations greatly improved over baseline levels and approximated their peers, they were often initiating below the level of most of their peers. Implications for improving peer social interactions for children with Asperger's Disorder are discussed.

Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)	2014	Jill Weisberg, Shawn C Milleville, Lauren Kenworthy, Gregory L Wallace, Stephen J Gotts, Michael S Beauchamp, Alex Martin		Studies of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) reveal dysfunction in the neural systems mediating object processing (particularly faces) and social cognition, but few investigations have systematically assessed the specificity of the dysfunction. We compared cortical responses in typically developing adolescents and those with ASD to stimuli from distinct conceptual domains known to elicit category-related activity in separate neural systems. In Experiment 1, subjects made category decisions to photographs, videos, and point-light displays of people and tools. In Experiment 2, subjects interpreted displays of simple, geometric shapes in motion depicting social or mechanical interactions. In both experiments, we found a selective deficit in the ASD subjects for dynamic social stimuli (videos and point-light displays of people, moving geometric shapes), but not static images, in the functionally localized lateral region of the right fusiform gyrus, including the fusiform face area. In contrast, no group differences were found in response to either static images or dynamic stimuli in other brain regions associated with face and social processing (e.g. posterior superior temporal sulcus, amygdala), suggesting disordered connectivity between these regions and the fusiform gyrus in ASD. This possibility was confirmed by functional connectivity analysis.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Sandrine Sonié, Behrouz Kassai, Elodie Pirat, Paul Bain, Janine Robinson, Marie Gomot, Catherine Barthélémy, Dorothée Charvet, Thierry Rochet, Mohamed Tatou, Brigitte Assouline, Stéphane Cabrol, Nadia Chabane, Valérie Arnaud, Patricia Faure, Sabine Manificat		We assessed the accuracy of the French version of the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) in adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) compared to healthy controls and adolescents with psychiatric disorders (PDs). Three groups of adolescents, aged 11-18, were assessed: 116 with AS/HFA (93 with IQ ≥ 85 and 20 with 70 ≤ IQ < 85), 39 with other PDs, and 199 healthy controls. The AS/HFA group scored significantly higher than the healthy control and PD groups. A cut-off score of 26 was used to differentiate the autism group from healthy controls with 0.89 sensitivity and 0.98 specificity. Scores did not vary by age or sex.

Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2012	Shun Nakamura, Genta Karino, Aya Senoo, Koki Mimura, Yuka Shirakawa, Kazuyuki Yamazaki, Yuta Fukushima, Saya Obara, Hitomi Sekihara, Shinpei Ozawa, Kunio Yui, Mamiko Koshiba		We have developed a multi variate analysis of social communication behavior which allows for discriminating the emotional state of an agent interacting with other agents (Bouquet method). Domestic chick or common marmoset was reared under socially isolated conditions, later tested for its development of communication behavior with peers by Bouquet, and compared with that of animals reared under grouping conditions. We found the existence of high sensitive period for social interaction, given less experience, developing less affiliated behavior. From chick model, a couple of neuronal difference was observed between two groups, amygdale core central cell size, MRI volumetric measure in mesolimbic area, and gene expression patter including brain type tryptophan hydroxylase in nucleus accumbens. The isolated chick behavior changed better to be socially affiliated by taking SSRI/SNRI or Ubiquinol (the reduced form of CoQ10) together with social interaction experience after the sensitive period. Finally, we could discriminate the behavior of Asperger syndrome children (n = 7) from that of the typically developed siblings (n = 6) during the clinical interview by applying Bouquet method.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Sander Begeer, David Mandell, Bernadette Wijnker-Holmes, Stance Venderbosch, Dorien Rem, Fred Stekelenburg, Hans M Koot		To examine differences by sex in the timing of identification of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), survey data were collected in the Netherlands from 2,275 males and females with autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS. Among participants < 18 years of age, females with Asperger's syndrome were identified later than males. Among participants ≥ 18 years of age, females with autistic disorder were identified later than males. In more recent years, girls with Asperger's syndrome are diagnosed later than boys, confirming earlier findings. In adults, the delayed timing of diagnosis in females with autistic disorder may be related to changing practices in diagnosis over time. Strategies for changing clinician behaviour to improve recognition of ASD in females are needed.
22999038	doi: 10.1016/j.apnu.2011.10.003	Autobiographical accounts of sensing in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism.	Archives of psychiatric nursing	2012	Marie Elwin, Lena Ek, Agneta Schröder, Lars Kjellin		Sensory experiences in Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) were explored by qualitative content analysis of autobiographical texts by persons with AS/HFA. Predetermined categories of hyper- and hyposensitivity were applied to texts. Hypersensitivity consists of strong reactions and heightened apprehension in reaction to external stimuli, sometimes together with overfocused or unselective attention. It was common in vision, hearing, and touch. In contrast, hyposensitivity was frequent in reaction to internal and body stimuli such as interoception, proprioception, and pain. It consists of less registration, discrimination, and recognition of stimuli as well as cravings for specific stimuli. Awareness of the strong impact of sensitivity is essential for creating good environments and encounters in the context of psychiatric and other health care.

Current psychiatry reports	2012	Saara Mahjouri, Catherine E Lord		In May 2013 the APA will release DSM-5, which will restructure the diagnostic classification for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) into a single category. The proposed changes in DSM-5 aim to better reflect the current state of research by consistently identifying the core features in social/communication and restrictive and repetitive behaviors that are specific to ASDs. This review describes the empirical and theoretical bases of research in the nosology of ASDs, given the impending shift in DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. General issues in diagnosis and prevalence are described, with differences between DSM-IV and DSM-5 highlighted. To address concerns about the application of the proposed DSM-5 criteria, the current literature assessing the sensitivity and specificity of the proposed DSM-5 criteria is reviewed. Last, we discuss the implications of the changes in DSM-5 for the treatment of ASDs and recommend areas for future research.

22987893	doi: 10.1177/1362361312456746	Spontaneous attention to faces in Asperger syndrome using ecologically valid static stimuli.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2013	Mary Hanley, Martin McPhillips, Gerry Mulhern, Deborah M Riby		Previous eye tracking research on the allocation of attention to social information by individuals with autism spectrum disorders is equivocal and may be in part a consequence of variation in stimuli used between studies. The current study explored attention allocation to faces, and within faces, by individuals with Asperger syndrome using a range of static stimuli where faces were either viewed in isolation or viewed in the context of a social scene. Results showed that faces were viewed typically by the individuals with Asperger syndrome when presented in isolation, but attention to the eyes was significantly diminished in comparison to age and IQ-matched typical viewers when faces were viewed as part of social scenes. We show that when using static stimuli, there is evidence of atypicality for individuals with Asperger syndrome depending on the extent of social context. Our findings shed light on the previous explanations of gaze behaviour that have emphasised the role of movement in atypicalities of social attention in autism spectrum disorders and highlight the importance of consideration of the realistic portrayal of social information for future studies.

Journal of pediatric surgery	2012	Jessica Lau, Charles W Hartin, Doruk E Ozgediz		Myositis ossificans is a type of bone-forming lesion that arises in soft tissue and mimics malignancy. We present a case of myositis ossificans in a 16-year-old girl with anxiety disorder, Asperger syndrome, and no known history of trauma. A variety of diagnostic tools including magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and biopsy are used to make the diagnosis. The histologic and radiographic findings used to distinguish this disorder from malignant conditions are discussed.

Research in developmental disabilities	2013	Annelies A Spek, Nadia C van Ham, Ivan Nyklíček		Research shows that depression and anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric concern in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Mindfulness-based therapy (MBT) has been found effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptoms, however research in autism is limited. Therefore, we examined the effects of a modified MBT protocol (MBT-AS) in high-functioning adults with ASD. 42 participants were randomized into a 9-week MBT-AS training or a wait-list control group. Results showed a significant reduction in depression, anxiety and rumination in the intervention group, as opposed to the control group. Furthermore, positive affect increased in the intervention group, but not in the control group. Concluding, the present study is the first controlled trial to demonstrate that adults with ASD can benefit from MBT-AS.

Iranian journal of psychiatry	2012	Mehdi Tehrani-Doost, Maryam Salmanian, Maria Ghanbari-Motlagh, Zahra Shahrivar		Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have great problems in social interactions including face recognition. There are many studies reporting deficits in face memory in individuals with ASDs. On the other hand, some studies indicate that this kind of memory is intact in this group. In the present study, delayed face recognition has been investigated in children and adolescents with ASDs compared to the age and sex matched typically developing group.

Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja	2012	Irma Moilanen, Marja-Leena Mattila, Soile Loukusa, Marko Kielinen		Childhood autism, Asperger's syndrome and atypical autism together make up autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with a prevalence of 0.6-0.7%. These disorders are defined by qualitative impairments in social interaction, qualitative abnormalities in communication, and by restricted, stereotyped, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests and activities. Many children or adolescents with ASDs have sensory abnormalities, neurological disorders and additional disabilities of vision, hearing or ambulation. Psychiatric co-morbidity is common. Diagnostics and rehabilitation are implemented in multi-professional collaboration. Early recognition makes up the basis for early intervention that improves the prognosis. Screening of these disorders in well-baby clinics is being developed.
24278834	doi: 10.7453/gahmj.2012.1.4.010	Autism spectrum disorders.	Global advances in health and medicine	2012	Kara Fitzgerald, Mark Hyman, Kathie Swift		Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are collectively the most commonly diagnosed pediatric neurodevelopmental condition. ASDs include autism, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett syndrome and Asperger disorder. ASD is characterized by impaired communication and social interaction and may involve developmental delays and seizure disorders. Recent parent-reported diagnosis of ASD in the United States put it at higher levels (1:91) than previously thought, with its diagnosis in boys occurring 4 to 5 times more frequently than in girls (1:58).(1) CDC estimates are currently 1:110;(1) up from 1:150 in 2007.(2) Annual medical expenditures for those affected are generally four to six times greater than for those without ASD.(1) While twin studies demonstrate that genetics play a significant role in ASD, the impact of environment should not be underestimated, given the approximate 20-fold increase in incidence over the last 20 years.(3.)

22934174	pii: 505393	Unique theory of mind differentiation in children with autism and asperger syndrome.	Autism research and treatment	2012	Michele Tine, Joan Lucariello		This study was designed to determine if ToM abilities of children with autism and Asperger syndrome differentiate into Intrapersonal ToM and Social ToM. A battery of Social and Intrapersonal ToM tasks was administered to 39 children with autism and 34 children with Asperger syndrome. For both groups of children, ToM differentiated and Intrapersonal ToM was stronger than Social ToM. This asymmetry was greater for children with autism, whose Social ToM was especially weak. These results support a differentiated, as opposed to integrated, ToM. Moreover, the findings provide a more thorough understanding of the cognitive abilities associated with autism and Asperger syndrome.
22934172	pii: 435646	Mood disorders in mothers of children on the autism spectrum are associated with higher functioning autism.	Autism research and treatment	2012	Roma A Vasa, Connie Anderson, Alison R Marvin, Rebecca E Rosenberg, J Kiely Law, Julia Thorn, Geeta Sarphare, Paul A Law		Mood disorders occur more frequently in family members of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) than in the general population. There may be associations between maternal mood disorder history patterns and specific ASD phenotypes. We therefore examined the relationship between maternal mood disorders and child autism spectrum disorders in 998 mother-child dyads enrolled in a national online autism registry and database. Mothers of children with ASD completed online questionnaires addressing their child's ASD as well as their own mood disorder history. In multivariate logistic regression models of ASD diagnoses, the odds of an Asperger disorder versus autistic disorder diagnosis were higher among those children whose mothers had a lifetime history of bipolar disorder (OR 2.11, CI 1.20, 3.69) or depression (OR 1.62, CI 1.19, 2.19). Further, maternal mood disorder onset before first pregnancy was associated with higher odds (OR 2.35, CI 1.48, 3.73) of an Asperger versus autism diagnosis among this sample of children with ASD. These data suggest that differences in maternal mood disorder history may be associated with ASD phenotype in offspring.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Andrea Marotta, Augusto Pasini, Sabrina Ruggiero, Lisa Maccari, Caterina Rosa, Juan Lupiáñez, Maria Casagrande		Inhibition of return (IOR) reflects slower reaction times to stimuli presented in previously attended locations. In this study, we examined this inhibitory after-effect using two different cue types, eye-gaze and standard peripheral cues, in individuals with Asperger's syndrome and typically developing individuals. Typically developing participants showed evidence of IOR for both eye-gaze and peripheral cues. In contrast, the Asperger group showed evidence of IOR to previously peripherally cued locations but failed to show IOR for eye-gaze cues. This absence of IOR for eye-gaze cues observed in the participants with Asperger may reflect an attentional impairment in responding to socially relevant information.
22928858	doi: 10.1111/j.1601-183X.2012.00841.x	Family history interview of a broad phenotype in specific language impairment and matched controls.	Genes, brain, and behavior	2012	N Kalnak, M Peyrard-Janvid, B Sahlén, H Forssberg	Department of Logopedics, Phoniatrics and Audiology, Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. Department of Women's and Children's Health, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital. Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.	The aim was to study a broader phenotype of language-related diagnoses and problems in three generations of relatives of children with specific language impairment (SLI). Our study is based on a family history interview of the parents of 59 children with SLI and of 100 matched control children, exploring the prevalence of problems related to language, reading, attention, school achievement and social communication as well as diagnoses such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, Asperger syndrome, dyslexia, mental retardation, cleft palate and stuttering. The results show a spectrum of language-related problems in families of SLI children. In all three generations of SLI relatives, we found significantly higher prevalence rates of language, literacy and social communication problems. The risk of one or both parents having language-related diagnoses or problems was approximately six times higher for the children with SLI (85%) than for the control children (13%) (odds ratio = 37.2). We did not find a significantly higher prevalence of the diagnoses ADHD, autism or Asperger syndrome in the relatives of the children with SLI. However, significantly more parents of the children with SLI had problems with attention/hyperactivity when compared with the parents of controls. Our findings suggest common underlying mechanisms for problems with language, literacy and social communication, and possibly also for attention/hyperactivity symptoms.
22928141	pii: 150261	Using primary care parenting interventions to improve outcomes in children with developmental disabilities: a case report.	Case reports in pediatrics	2012	Cassandra L Tellegen, Matthew R Sanders		Parenting is central to the health and well-being of children. Children with developmental disabilities have been shown to be at increased risk of developing emotional and behavioral problems. Parent training programs are effective interventions for improving child behavior and family functioning. This paper describes the outcomes of a brief 4-session parenting intervention (Primary Care Stepping Stones Triple P) targeting compliance and cooperative play skills in an 8-year-old girl with Asperger's disorder and ADHD combined type. The intervention was associated with decreases in child behavior problems, increases in parenting confidence, and decreases in dysfunctional parenting styles. This paper demonstrates that low-intensity parenting interventions can lead to significant improvements in child behavior and family functioning. Such brief interventions are cost effective, can be widely disseminated, and have been designed to be delivered within primary health care settings. Pediatricians can play a key role in identifying parents in need of assistance and in helping them access evidence-based parenting interventions.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Richard S Smith, Jonathan Sharp		Unusual sensory experiences are commonly seen in people with Asperger syndrome (AS). They correlate with functional impairments and cause distress. The current study investigates how these experiences have affected nine adults with AS's lives, as well as the coping strategies utilised. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using Instant Messaging software. Data were analysed using Grounded Theory. A number of inter-related categories and focused codes were identified. The categories included heightened senses, sensory stress, the stress avalanche, moderating factors, coping strategies, other people, self-acceptance, fascination, and isolation. A model was constructed as to how these categories and codes interact. How these findings link with previous research into autism spectrum disorders is discussed. Implications for services and future research are also made.

The Journal of nervous and mental disease	2012	Emma Jane Lawrence, Rachael Dumigan, Poppy Schoenberg, Sierra Mauricio, Declan G Murphy, Anthony S David		Conditional reasoning premises can be systematically manipulated to elicit specific response patterns. This is useful for investigating the reasoning style of people who report clinical symptoms. We administered a standardized conditional reasoning task to 16 participants with a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome (AS), 16 participants with a diagnosis of depersonalization disorder (DPD), and 32 intelligence-quotient-matched controls. Premises were manipulated for a) context, with some being embedded within extra statements, and b) content, neutral or emotional. Both the AS and DPD participants were less likely to incorporate exceptions to the given premises than the controls, indicating difficulties with mental flexibility, although this effect was less marked in the DPD group. It seems the AS participants were also less influenced than the controls by statements that highlight possible alternative consequences. However, this effect was less robust than that observed with statements detailing exceptions, suggesting it may be because of general problems with executive function rather than difficulties in processing contextual information. We did not observe the expected difference between the DPD participants and the controls when reasoning with emotional premises. Overall, these data suggest that the DPD and AS participants have distinct reasoning styles, which may be of use for interventions based on cognitive change.

European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2013	Luigi Boccuto, Maria Lauri, Sara M Sarasua, Cindy D Skinner, Daniela Buccella, Alka Dwivedi, Daniela Orteschi, Julianne S Collins, Marcella Zollino, Paola Visconti, Barb Dupont, Danilo Tiziano, Richard J Schroer, Giovanni Neri, Roger E Stevenson, Fiorella Gurrieri, Charles E Schwartz		Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include three main conditions: autistic disorder (AD), pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. It has been shown that many genes associated with ASDs are involved in the neuroligin-neurexin interaction at the glutamate synapse: NLGN3, NLGN4, NRXN1, CNTNAP2, and SHANK3. We screened this last gene in two cohorts of ASD patients (133 patients from US and 88 from Italy). We found 5/221 (2.3%) cases with pathogenic alterations: a 106 kb deletion encompassing the SHANK3 gene, two frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons, a missense mutation (p.Pro141Ala), and a splicing mutation (c.1820-4 G>A). Additionally, in 17 patients (7.7%) we detected a c.1304+48C>T transition affecting a methylated cytosine in a CpG island. This variant is reported as SNP rs76224556 and was found in both US and Italian controls, but it results significantly more frequent in our cases than in the control cohorts. The variant is also significantly more common among PDD-NOS cases than in AD cases. We also screened this gene in an independent replication cohort of 104 US patients with ASDs, in which we found a missense mutation (p.Ala1468Ser) in 1 patient (0.9%), and in 8 patients (7.7%) we detected the c.1304+48C>T transition. While SHANK3 variants are present in any ASD subtype, the SNP rs76224556 appears to be significantly associated with PDD-NOS cases. This represents the first evidence of a genotype-phenotype correlation in ASDs and highlights the importance of a detailed clinical-neuropsychiatric evaluation for the effective genetic screening of ASD patients.

22883468	doi: 10.1016/j.braindev.2012.07.012	Autism in siblings with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy.	Brain & development	2013	Tomoko Miyajima, Tomohiro Kumada, Keiko Saito, Tatsuya Fujii		In 1999, Hirose et al. reported a Japanese family with autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE) associated with a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α4 subunit mutation (S252L). We followed the siblings of this family, and found that the elder brother had Asperger's disorder without mental retardation (MR) and the younger brother had autistic disorder with profound MR. The clinical epileptic features of the siblings were very similar, and both had deficits in socialization, but their cognitive development differed markedly. It thus seems that epilepsy is the direct phenotype of the S252L mutation, whereas other various factors modulate the cognitive and social development. No patients with ADNFLE have previously been reported to have autism spectrum disorder or profound MR.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Karmen Schmidt, Andrew Zimmerman, Margaret Bauman, Christine Ferrone, Jacob Venter, Jessaca Spybrook, Charles Henry		Prior investigations suggest that birth order position may be associated with the risk for developing a pervasive developmental disorder. This retrospective chart review examined the birth order status of 29 psychiatrically-referred patients with Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Eighty-six percent of the subjects were first born. The finding was statistically significant when compared to an expected random distribution of AS subjects χ(2) (1, N = 29) = 9.18, p < 0.01. The reasons for such an association are unclear though birth stoppage, obstetric complications, and immunological mechanisms may play a role.
22865711	doi: 10.1002/aur.1246	Using eye movements as an index of implicit face recognition in autism spectrum disorder.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2012	Darren Hedley, Robyn Young, Neil Brewer		Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) typically show impairment on face recognition tasks. Performance has usually been assessed using overt, explicit recognition tasks. Here, a complementary method involving eye tracking was used to examine implicit face recognition in participants with ASD and in an intelligence quotient-matched non-ASD control group. Differences in eye movement indices between target and foil faces were used as an indicator of implicit face recognition. Explicit face recognition was assessed using old-new discrimination and reaction time measures. Stimuli were faces of studied (target) or unfamiliar (foil) persons. Target images at test were either identical to the images presented at study or altered by changing the lighting, pose, or by masking with visual noise. Participants with ASD performed worse than controls on the explicit recognition task. Eye movement-based measures, however, indicated that implicit recognition may not be affected to the same degree as explicit recognition.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Alessandro Crippa, Sara Forti, Paolo Perego, Massimo Molteni		We investigated eye-hand coordination in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in comparison with age-matched normally developing peers. The eye-hand correlation was measured by putting fixation latencies in relation with pointing and key pressing responses in visual detection tasks where a gap-overlap paradigm was used and compared to fixation latencies in absence of manual response. ASD patients showed less efficient eye-hand coordination, which was particularly evident when pointing towards a target was being fixated. The data of normally developing participants confirmed that manual gap effects are more likely for more complex hand movements. An important discrepancy was discovered in participants with ASD: beside normal eye gap effects, they showed no concurrent hand gap effects when pointing to targets. This result has been interpreted as a further sign of inefficient eye-hand coordination in this patient population.
22861133	doi: 10.1352/1934-9556-50.4.322	Shared decision making: improving care for children with autism.	Intellectual and developmental disabilities	2012	Allison Golnik, Nadia Maccabee-Ryaboy, Peter Scal, Andrew Wey, Philippe Gaillard		We assessed the extent to which parents of children with autism spectrum disorder report that they are engaged in shared decision making. We measured the association between shared decision making and (a) satisfaction with care, (b) perceived guidance regarding controversial issues in autism spectrum disorder, and (c) perceived assistance navigating the multitude of treatment options. Surveys assessing primary medical care and decision-making processes were developed on the basis of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. In May 2009, after pilot testing, we sent surveys to 203 parents of children from ages 3 to 18 with International Classification of Diseases-9 and parent-confirmed autism spectrum disorder diagnoses. The response rate was 64%. Controlling for key demographic variables, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder reporting higher levels of shared decision making reported significantly greater satisfaction with the overall quality of their child's health care (p ≤ .0001). Parents reporting higher levels of shared decision making were also significantly more likely to report receiving guidance on the many treatment options (p  =  .0002) and controversial issues related to autism spectrum disorder (p  =  .0322). In this study, shared decision making was associated with higher parent satisfaction and improved guidance regarding treatments and controversial issues within primary care for children with autism spectrum disorder.

22851255	doi: 10.1007/s12402-012-0086-2	ADHD and autism: differential diagnosis or overlapping traits? A selective review.	Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders	2012	Regina Taurines, Christina Schwenck, Eva Westerwald, Michael Sachse, Michael Siniatchkin, Christine Freitag		According to DSM-IV TR and ICD-10, a diagnosis of autism or Asperger Syndrome precludes a diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, despite the different conceptualization, population-based twin studies reported symptom overlap, and a recent epidemiologically based study reported a high rate of ADHD in autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the planned revision of the DSM-IV TR, dsm5 (www.dsm5.org), the diagnoses of autistic disorder and ADHD will not be mutually exclusive any longer. This provides the basis of more differentiated studies on overlap and distinction between both disorders. This review presents data on comorbidity rates and symptom overlap and discusses common and disorder-specific risk factors, including recent proteomic studies. Neuropsychological findings in the areas of attention, reward processing, and social cognition are then compared between both disorders, as these cognitive abilities show overlapping as well as specific impairment for one of both disorders. In addition, selective brain imaging findings are reported. Therapeutic options are summarized, and new approaches are discussed. The review concludes with a prospectus on open questions for research and clinical practice.
22849533	doi: 10.1089/cap.2011.0129	The effects of aripiprazole on electrocardiography in children with pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2012	Jason G Ho, Randall L Caldwell, Christopher J McDougle, Danielle K Orsagh-Yentis, Craig A Erickson, David J Posey, Kimberly A Stigler		Psychotropic medications, including the atypical antipsychotics, have historically been scrutinized for cardiac effects and risk of sudden death. Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic approved for pediatric use in schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and autistic disorder. Adult studies have evaluated aripiprazole's effects on electrocardiograms, but no pediatric studies have been published to date.
22832731	doi: 10.1038/tp.2011.65	Age-related change in brain metabolite abnormalities in autism: a meta-analysis of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies.	Translational psychiatry	2012	Y Aoki, K Kasai, H Yamasue		Abnormal trajectory of brain development has been suggested by previous structural magnetic resonance imaging and head circumference findings in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs); however, the neurochemical backgrounds remain unclear. To elucidate neurochemical processes underlying aberrant brain growth in ASD, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and a meta-analysis of (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) studies in ASD. From the 22 articles identified as satisfying the criteria, means and s.d. of measure of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), creatine, choline-containing compounds, myo-Inositol and glutamate+glutamine in frontal, temporal, parietal, amygdala-hippocampus complex, thalamus and cerebellum were extracted. Random effect model analyses showed significantly lower NAA levels in all the examined brain regions but cerebellum in ASD children compared with typically developed children (n=1295 at the maximum in frontal, P<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected), although there was no significant difference in metabolite levels in adulthood. Meta-regression analysis further revealed that the effect size of lower frontal NAA levels linearly declined with older mean age in ASD (n=844, P<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected). The significance of all frontal NAA findings was preserved after considering between-study heterogeneities (P<0.05 Bonferroni-corrected). This first meta-analysis of (1)H-MRS studies in ASD demonstrated robust developmental changes in the degree of abnormality in NAA levels, especially in frontal lobes of ASD. Previously reported larger-than-normal brain size in ASD children and the coincident lower-than-normal NAA levels suggest that early transient brain expansion in ASD is mainly caused by an increase in non-neuron tissues, such as glial cell proliferation.
22822384		A 380-kb Duplication in 7p22.3 Encompassing the LFNG Gene in a Boy with Asperger Syndrome.	Molecular syndromology	2012	A T Vulto-van Silfhout, A F M de Brouwer, N de Leeuw, C C Obihara, H G Brunner, B B A de Vries		De novo genomic aberrations are considered an important cause of autism spectrum disorders. We describe a de novo 380-kb gain in band p22.3 of chromosome 7 in a patient with Asperger syndrome. This duplicated region contains 9 genes including the LNFG gene that is an important regulator of NOTCH signaling. We suggest that this copy number variation has been a contributive factor to the occurrence of Asperger syndrome in this patient.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	2012	Yael Hacohen, Sukhvir Wright, Ata Siddiqui, Nikki Pandya, Jean-Pierre Lin, Angela Vincent, Ming Lim		In childhood, central nervous system (CNS) presentations associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) complex include limbic encephalitis, status epilepticus, epileptic encephalopathy, and autistic regression. We report the cases of two individuals (a 6-year-old male and an 11-year-old female) who presented with an acute-onset explosive seizure disorder with positive VGKC complex antibodies and bilateral basal ganglia changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Both patients made a complete clinical recovery, without immunotherapy, with resolution of the MRI changes and normalization of the antibody levels. Extended antibody testing, including testing for leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), contactin-associated protein 2, and contactin-2 was negative. This could suggest that the clinico-radiological phenotype in our patients may in fact be associated with a novel autoreactive target(s) within the VGKC complex, as may be the case in other children with VGKC complex-mediated CNS disorders.

Journal of clinical psychology	2012	Lake-Hui Quek, Kate Sofronoff, Jeanie Sheffield, Angela White, Adrian Kelly		The co-occurrence of anger in young people with Asperger's syndrome (AS) has received little attention despite aggression, agitation, and tantrums frequently being identified as issues of concern in this population. The present study investigated the occurrence of anger in young people with AS and explores its relationship with anxiety and depression.
22790383	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1596-7	Brief report: treating stuttering in an adult with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Shelley B Brundage, Cory J Whelan, Cathleen M Burgess		Stuttering and autism can co-occur and when they do it presents a significant communication challenge. This study examined the effectiveness of a modified version of the fluency rules program (FRP; Runyan and Runyan, Stuttering and related disorders of fluency, in 2007) to reduce stuttering frequency in a man with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The participant's percentage of stuttered words (%SW) was calculated during conversational interactions with multiple conversation partners both within and outside of the clinic treatment sessions. Visual inspection methods revealed a reduction in %SW from an average of 14.5 %SW during baseline to 2.07 %SW during the withdrawal phase. The mean baseline reduction in %SW from baseline to the second treatment phase was 91.8 %. The FRP holds promise for reducing %SW in persons with ASD who stutter.

PharmacoEconomics	2012	J Mick Tilford, Nalin Payakachat, Erica Kovacs, Jeffrey M Pyne, Werner Brouwer, Todd G Nick, Jayne Bellando, Karen A Kuhlthau		Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmaceutical and other treatments for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has the potential to improve access to services by demonstrating the value of treatment to public and private payers, but methods for measuring QALYs in children are under-studied. No cost-effectiveness analyses have been undertaken in this population using the cost-per-QALY metric.
22787990		'They said I was rude'.	Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987)		Lynne Wallis		Nurses on the autism scale, which includes Asperger's syndrome, may struggle to fit in with colleagues and risk being viewed as having a bad attitude. Here, a nurse diagnosed with Asperger's says that her employers did not offer her the support she required. People with autism can make a valuable contribution in the workplace if adjustments are made for their communication difficulties.
22760338	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1588-7	The role of causal and intentional judgments in moral reasoning in individuals with high functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Marine Buon, Emmanuel Dupoux, Pierre Jacob, Pauline Chaste, Marion Leboyer, Tiziana Zalla		In the present study, we investigated the ability to assign moral responsibility and punishment in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS), using non-verbal cartoons depicting an aggression, an accidental harm or a mere coincidence. Participants were asked to evaluate the agent's causal and intentional roles, his responsibility and the punishment he deserves for his action. Adults with HFA/AS did not differ in judgments of suffering and causality from adults with typical development. However, subtle difficulties with judgments of intentional action and moral judgments were observed in participants with HFA/AS. These results are discussed in the light of emerging studies that deal with integrity of moral reasoning in individuals with autism spectrum disorders.
22753237	doi: 10.1002/aur.1242	Selective attention to facial emotion and identity in children with autism: evidence for global identity and local emotion.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2012	Yongning Song, Yuji Hakoda		The present study sought to test the global-identity and local-emotion processing hypothesis in face perception by examining emotional interference in face perception in children with high-functioning autism/Asperger's syndrome. Participants judged either the expression or the identity of faces while identity/expression was either held constant or varied (Garner paradigm). The results revealed that emotional expressions interfered with identity processing in face perception for autism spectrum disorder individuals. Taken together with previous findings, our results suggest that emotion judgment mainly depends on local processing, while identity judgment mainly depends on global processing.

The degree to which these disorders share a basis in etiology has important implications for clinicians, researchers, and those affected by the disorders.
22743806	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1567-z	(Re-)conceptualisation in Asperger's syndrome and typical individuals with varying degrees of autistic-like traits.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Hollie G Burnett, Tjeerd Jellema		The abilities to form new concepts from scratch (conceptualisation), and to flexibly switch from one concept to another (re-conceptualisation), were investigated in adults with Asperger's Syndrome and in typically-developed adults with low and high autism spectrum quotients. In consecutively presented morphs, containing increasing percentages of animate or inanimate objects, the emerging objects had to be identified. The abilities to conceptualise and reconceptualise became increasingly impaired with increasing autistic(-like) traits. Across both tasks, all groups recognised animate objects quicker than inanimate objects. However, this 'animate advantage' was differently affected by the two tasks. In the Reconceptualisation task, the 'animate advantage' gradually disappeared with increasing autistic(-like) traits, whereas in the Conceptualisation task it remained present.
22738084	doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2012.08172.x	Abnormal modulation of corticospinal excitability in adults with Asperger's syndrome.	The European journal of neuroscience	2012	Lindsay Oberman, Mark Eldaief, Shirley Fecteau, Fritz Ifert-Miller, Jose Maria Tormos, Alvaro Pascual-Leone		Most candidate genes and genetic abnormalities linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are thought to play a role in developmental and experience-dependent plasticity. As a possible index of plasticity, we assessed the modulation of motor corticospinal excitability in individuals with Asperger's syndrome (AS) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). We measured the modulatory effects of theta-burst stimulation (TBS) on motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by single-pulse TMS in individuals with AS as compared with age-, gender- and IQ-matched neurotypical controls. The effect of TBS lasted significantly longer in the AS group. The duration of the TBS-induced modulation alone enabled the reliable classification of a second study cohort of subjects as AS or neurotypical. The alteration in the modulation of corticospinal excitability in AS is thought to reflect aberrant mechanisms of plasticity, and might provide a valuable future diagnostic biomarker for the disease and ultimately offer a target for novel therapeutic interventions.
22733299	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1581-1	Social anxiety in parents of high-functioning children with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Sanna Kuusikko-Gauffin, Rachel Pollock-Wurman, Marja-Leena Mattila, Katja Jussila, Hanna Ebeling, David Pauls, Irma Moilanen		We evaluated social anxiety (SA) symptoms in parents of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs; N = 131) and community parents (N = 597) using the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI). SA was significantly more common in ASD than control mothers (15.6 vs. 6.7 %) and more equal between the ASD and control fathers (3.3 vs. 4.8 %). The ASD mothers scored significantly higher than control mothers on all SPAI scales. ASD fathers scored significantly higher than control fathers on the somatic, cognitive, avoidance and agoraphobic symptoms of SA. It is of clinical import to support ASD parents' well-being as their psychiatric features may contribute greatly to their children's emotional development and the well-being of the whole family.
22731684	doi: 10.1186/1744-859X-11-16	Psychiatric comorbidities in asperger syndrome and high functioning autism: diagnostic challenges.	Annals of general psychiatry	2012	Luigi Mazzone, Liliana Ruta, Laura Reale		Several psychiatric conditions, both internalizing and externalizing, have been documented in comorbidity with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and High Functioning Autism (HFA). In this review we examine the interplay between psychiatric comorbidities and AS/HFA. In particular, we will focus our attention on three main issues. First, we examine which psychiatric disorders are more frequently associated with AS/HFA. Second, we review which diagnostic tools are currently available for clinicians to investigate and diagnose the associated psychiatric disorders in individuals with AS/HFA. Third, we discuss the challenges that clinicians and researchers face in trying to determine whether the psychiatric symptoms are phenotypic manifestations of AS/HFA or rather they are the expression of a distinct, though comorbid, disorder. We will also consider the role played by the environment in the manifestation and interpretation of these symptoms. Finally, we will propose some strategies to try to address these issues, and we will discuss therapeutic implications.
22729383	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1578-9	Individuals with Asperger's disorder exhibit difficulty in switching attention from a local level to a global level.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Masatoshi Katagiri, Tetsuko Kasai, Yoko Kamio, Harumitsu Murohashi		The purpose of the present study was to determine whether individuals with Asperger's disorder exhibit difficulty in switching attention from a local level to a global level. Eleven participants with Asperger's disorder and 11 age- and gender-matched healthy controls performed a level-repetition switching task using Navon-type hierarchical stimuli. In both groups, level-repetition was beneficial at both levels. Furthermore, individuals with Asperger's disorder exhibited difficulty in switching attention from a local level to a global level compared to control individuals. These findings suggested that there is a problem with the inhibitory mechanism that influences the output of enhanced local visual processing in Asperger's disorder.
22727823	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.06.017	GABAergic activity in autism spectrum disorders: an investigation of cortical inhibition via transcranial magnetic stimulation.	Neuropharmacology	2013	Peter G Enticott, Hayley A Kennedy, Nicole J Rinehart, Bruce J Tonge, John L Bradshaw, Paul B Fitzgerald		Mounting evidence suggests a possible role for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the neuropathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but the extent of this impairment is unclear. A non-invasive, in vivo measure of GABA involves transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex to probe cortical inhibition. Individuals diagnosed with ASD (high-functioning autism or Asperger's disorder) (n = 36 [28 male]; mean age: 26.00 years) and a group of healthy individuals (n = 34 [23 male]; mean age: 26.21 years) (matched for age, gender, and cognitive function) were administered motor cortical TMS paradigms putatively measuring activity at GABAA and GABAB receptors (i.e., short and long interval paired pulse TMS, cortical silent period). All cortical inhibition paradigms yielded no difference between ASD and control groups. There was, however, evidence for short interval cortical inhibition (SICI) deficits among those ASD participants who had experienced early language delay, suggesting that GABA may be implicated in an ASD subtype. The current findings do not support a broad role for GABA in the neuropathophysiology of ASD, but provide further indication that GABAA could be involved in ASD where there is a delay in language acquisition. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.
22721927	doi: 10.1093/arclin/acs052	Decision-making in individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum: expectancy-valence in the Iowa Gambling Task.	Archives of clinical neuropsychology : the official journal of the National Academy of Neuropsychologists	2012	Warren S Brown, Luke B Anderson, Melissa F Symington, Lynn K Paul		Individuals with agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) can have intelligence within the normal range, but nevertheless have deficiencies in decision-making and complex novel problem-solving. The specific nature of these problems is not yet clearly understood. The Iowa Gambling Task was used to test decision-making ability and problem-solving in 40 individuals with complete or partial ACC (full-scale intelligence quotient >80) and 26 control participants. The expectancy-valence (EV) model was applied to the trial-by-trial responses of each participant to elucidate differences in decision processes utilized by each group. The ACC group had a lower overall net gain and fewer advantageous choices than controls, but these differences were not statistically significant. Within the EV model, individuals with ACC exhibited significantly higher attention to losses, less consistency in their choice strategy, and greater frequency of switching between decks. They also showed a tendency to be more influenced by recent trials. This outcome is similar to that seen in individuals with Asperger's disorder. Taken together, these results suggest that individuals with ACC have difficulty in inferring game contingencies and forming a coherent selection strategy, implicating the corpus callosum in these decision processes.

Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders extra	2012	Akira Midorikawa, Mitsuru Kawamura		The existence of the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bv-FTD), including senile Asperger's syndrome (AS), has been proposed. However, there are no empirical case reports to support the proposal. In this report, we present 3 patients who showed symptoms of bv-FTD and demonstrated signs of autistic spectrum disorder, especially AS.
22716265	doi: 10.1352/1944-7558-117.3.233	Vaccine-related beliefs and practices of parents of children with autism spectrum disorders.	American journal on intellectual and developmental disabilities	2012	Alicia Bazzano, Ari Zeldin, Erica Schuster, Christopher Barrett, Danise Lehrer		Although the assertion of a link between vaccines and autism has been scientifically rejected, the theory continues to be popular and may influence the attitudes of parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. The authors sought to assess how often parents change or discontinue their child's vaccine schedule after autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and whether beliefs about the etiology of autism affect their decision to do so. The authors surveyed 197 (43%) of 460 eligible parents of children under 18 years of age with autism spectrum disorders who were enrolled in a state-funded agency that provides services to those with developmental disabilities in western Los Angeles County. Half of the parents discontinued or changed vaccination practices, and this was associated with a belief that vaccines contributed to autism spectrum disorders, indicating a potential subset of undervaccinated children. Educational tools should be designed to assist physicians when talking to parents of children with autism spectrum disorders about vaccination.
22701630	pii: e38355	Sex differences and autism: brain function during verbal fluency and mental rotation.	PloS one	2012	Felix D C C Beacher, Eugenia Radulescu, Ludovico Minati, Simon Baron-Cohen, Michael V Lombardo, Meng-Chuan Lai, Anne Walker, Dawn Howard, Marcus A Gray, Neil A Harrison, Hugo D Critchley		Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) affect more males than females. This suggests that the neurobiology of autism: 1) may overlap with mechanisms underlying typical sex-differentiation or 2) alternately reflect sex-specificity in how autism is expressed in males and females. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test these alternate hypotheses. Fifteen men and fourteen women with Asperger syndrome (AS), and sixteen typically developing men and sixteen typically developing women underwent fMRI during performance of mental rotation and verbal fluency tasks. All groups performed the tasks equally well. On the verbal fluency task, despite equivalent task-performance, both males and females with AS showed enhanced activation of left occipitoparietal and inferior prefrontal activity compared to controls. During mental rotation, there was a significant diagnosis-by-sex interaction across occipital, temporal, parietal, middle frontal regions, with greater activation in AS males and typical females compared to AS females and typical males. These findings suggest a complex relationship between autism and sex that is differentially expressed in verbal and visuospatial domains.
22689217	doi: 10.1093/scan/nss067	Selective impairment of cognitive empathy for moral judgment in adults with high functioning autism.	Social cognitive and affective neuroscience	2013	Ezequiel Gleichgerrcht, Teresa Torralva, Alexia Rattazzi, Victoria Marenco, María Roca, Facundo Manes		Faced with a moral dilemma, conflict arises between a cognitive controlled response aimed at maximizing welfare, i.e. the utilitarian judgment, and an emotional aversion to harm, i.e. the deontological judgment. In the present study, we investigated moral judgment in adult individuals with high functioning autism/Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS), a clinical population characterized by impairments in prosocial emotions and social cognition. In Experiment 1, we compared the response patterns of HFA/AS participants and neurotypical controls to moral dilemmas with low and high emotional saliency. We found that HFA/AS participants more frequently delivered the utilitarian judgment. Their perception of appropriateness of moral transgression was similar to that of controls, but HFA/AS participants reported decreased levels of emotional reaction to the dilemma. In Experiment 2, we explored the way in which demographic, clinical and social cognition variables including emotional and cognitive aspects of empathy and theory of mind influenced moral judgment. We found that utilitarian HFA/AS participants showed a decreased ability to infer other people's thoughts and to understand their intentions, as measured both by performance on neuropsychological tests and through dispositional measures. We conclude that greater prevalence of utilitarianism in HFA/AS is associated with difficulties in specific aspects of social cognition.

22669539	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1554-4	Predictive value of morphological features in patients with autism versus normal controls.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	H Ozgen, G S Hellemann, M V de Jonge, F A Beemer, H van Engeland		We investigated the predictive power of morphological features in 224 autistic patients and 224 matched-pairs controls. To assess the relationship between the morphological features and autism, we used the receiver operator curves (ROC). In addition, we used recursive partitioning (RP) to determine a specific pattern of abnormalities that is characteristic for the difference between autistic children and typically developing controls. The present findings showed that morphological features are significantly increased in patients with autism. Using ROC and RP, some of the morphological measures also led to strong predictive accuracy. Facial asymmetry, multiple hair whorls and prominent forehead significantly differentiated patients with autism from controls. Future research on multivariable risk prediction models may benefit from the use of morphological features.

PloS one	2012	Louise Robinson, Michael D Spencer, Lindsay D G Thomson, Andrew C Stanfield, David G C Owens, Jeremy Hall, Eve C Johnstone		There have been concerns that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are over-represented but not recognised in prison populations. A screening tool for ASDs in prisons has therefore been developed.
22650115		Autism and autistic spectrum disorders in the context of new DSM-V classification, and clinical and epidemiological data.	Srpski arhiv za celokupno lekarstvo	2012	Miodrag Stanković, Aneta Lakić, Neda Ilić		Autism is one of disorders from the autism spectrum, besides Asperger syndrome, atypical autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. They are classified as mental disorders as being manifested by a wide range of cognitive, emotional and neurobehavioural abnormalities. Key categorical characteristics of the disorder are clear impairments of the development of the child's socialisation, understanding and production of verbal and non-verbal communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour. Demarcation boundaries are not clear, neither within the very group of the disorders from the autistic spectrum, nor with respect to the autistic behavioural features in the general population. For this reason, the term spectrum points out the significance of the dimensional assessment of autistic disorders, which will most likely be the basis of the new diagnostic classification of the disorders belonging to the current group of pervasive developmental disorders in the new DSM-V classification. The understanding, as well as the prevalence of the autistic spectrum disorders has changed drastically in the last four decades. From the previous 4 per 10,000 people, today's prevalence estimates range from 0.6 to around 1%, and the increase of prevalence cannot be explained solely by better recognition on the part of experts and parents or by wider diagnostic criteria. The general conclusion is that the autistic spectrum disorders are no longer rare conditions and that the approach aimed at acknowledging the warning that this is an urgent public health problem is completely justified.
22796975		[The projection of autism spectrum disorders in adult life].	Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki	2012	K Francis	"2nd Department of Psychiatry, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, ""Attikon"" University General Hospital of Athens, Athens, Greece."	Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) consist a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that are usually diagnosed in early childhood but they persist throughout life, although significant changes can happen. The prevalence of the ASDs is estimated to be 1-1.2%. Subjects with the more severe form of the disorder that are usually characterised by the absence of a communicative language and learning difficulties of various severity, are often referred as persons with lower functioning. In the other end of the spectrum we can find subjects with less severe symptomatology, communicative language and at least of normal intelligence that are referred as high functioning autistic people or -in case of an absence of a language delay- as suffering from Asperger syndrome. The lower functioning adults can be referred to an adult psychiatrist mainly due to their behavioral problems and disruptive behaviors. Their inability to express their difficulties, due to their language restrictions and empathy deficits, can lead these people to behavioural deviances (often self- or hetero-destructive) that challenge their personal environment ending up in the pursuit of psychiatric help. In most cases, although not always justified, psychotropic medications will be prescribed in an attempt to control their maladaptive behaviors. Special attention should be paid to the catatonic exacerbation of ASD, which can be exhibited after adolescence. The catatonic features presented shouldn't be perceived as a possible comorbidity with another disorder, such as schizophrenia, but rather as an extreme form anxiety within the context of an ASD. High Functioning adults with ASDs are more difficult to be detected, but they may also need psychiatric consultation. These subjects may have never been diagnosed with an ASD, but they could have in their history a variety of diagnostic categorizations. Their accurate diagnosis could be further hampered in cases where they are exhibiting remarkable abilities, professional success or even an adequate social adaptation, such as marriage and family. Very often their symptoms will be confused with those of other disorders and they will be also prescribed psychotropic medication with very few, if any, results. In the current paper, we will point out the symptoms and situations that should alert the psychiatrist for the presence of an ASD in an adult with a normal intelligence and adequate functioning that is referred to him for bizarre ideas or behaviors. The designated diagnostic procedure for the ascertainment of the ASD in this case is similar to the one followed for children and adolescents and comprises of a detailed developmental history and a relevant observation and interview. Finally, we will discuss the most common difficulties in the differential diagnosis of the high functioning adults with an ASD from those suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Schizoid Personality Disorder, Schizophrenia and Psychosis, and we will provide key issues that can be of an assistance in the more accurate assessment and categorization of the presented symptoms.
22644617	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1555-3	Brief report: pointing cues facilitate word learning in children with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Hironori Akechi, Yukiko Kikuchi, Yoshikuni Tojo, Hiroo Osanai, Toshikazu Hasegawa		Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reportedly have difficulty associating novel words to an object via the speaker's gaze. It has also been suggested that their performance is related to their gaze duration on the object and improves when the object moves and becomes more salient. However, there is a possibility that they have only relied on the object's movement and have not referenced the speaker's cue (i.e. gaze direction). The current study with children with ASD and typically developing children aged 6-11 years demonstrated that adding another speaker's cue (i.e. pointing) improves the performance of children with ASD. This suggests that additional speaker's cues may help referential word learning in children with ASD.

Neuroreport	2012	Owen Churches, Cara Damiano, Simon Baron-Cohen, Howard Ring		Social difficulties form a part of the canonical description of autism spectrum conditions (ASC), and the development of familiarity with new faces is a key ability required to navigate the social world. Here, we investigated the acquisition of new face representations in ASC by analysing the N170 and N250 event-related potential components induced by a previously unfamiliar face that was embedded in a series of other unfamiliar faces. We found that participants with ASC developed a smaller N250 component to the target face, indicating that the development of new face representations is impaired. We also found that the participants with ASC showed a smaller N170 component to both the target and the nontarget faces. This highlights the role of the early stages of face detection, structural encoding and attention in the formation of face memories in the typical population and implicates the dysfunction of these stages in the manifestation of the social difficulties observed in ASC.

Intellectual and developmental disabilities	2012	Hanna Bertilsdotter Rosqvist	Department of Sociology and Umeå Centre for Gender Studies, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. Hanna.Bertilsdotter@soc.umu.se	"This study explores the production of a counterhegemonic discourse of ""autistic normalcy"" among adults with high-functioning autism by analyzing notions of diagnosis. The discourse analyses are based on material from ethnographic fieldwork in a Swedish educational setting. Study participants were 3 male and 9 female adults who had been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The notion of diagnosis comprises issues concerning coming out and knowledge production. The findings capture an ongoing reformulation process among people involved in the autistic self-advocacy movement when it comes to the meanings of Asperger syndrome and what it means to be a person with Asperger syndrome."
22642342	doi: 10.1037/a0027975	Emotion regulation in Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism.	Emotion (Washington, D.C.)	2012	Andrea C Samson, Oswald Huber, James J Gross		It is generally thought that individuals with Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism (AS/HFA) have deficits in theory of mind. These deficits have been previously linked to problems with social cognition. However, we reasoned that AS/HFA individuals' Theory of Mind deficits also might lead to problems with emotion regulation. To assess emotional functioning in AS/HFA, 27 AS/HFA adults (16 women) and 27 age-, gender-, and education-matched typically developing (TD) participants completed a battery of measures of emotion experience, labeling, and regulation. With respect to emotion experience, individuals with AS/HFA reported higher levels of negative emotions, but similar levels of positive emotions, compared with TD individuals. With respect to emotion labeling, individuals with AS/HFA had greater difficulties identifying and describing their emotions, with approximately two-thirds exceeding the cutoff for alexithymia. With respect to emotion regulation, individuals with AS/HFA used reappraisal less frequently than TD individuals and reported lower levels of reappraisal self-efficacy. Although AS/HFA individuals used suppression more frequently than TD individuals, no difference in suppression self-efficacy was found. It is important to note that these differences in emotion regulation were evident even when controlling for emotion experience and labeling. Implications of these deficits are discussed, and future research directions are proposed.

Biomeditsinskaia khimiia	2011	A S Gorina, L S Kolesnichenko, V I Mikhnovich		Children with Asperger and Kanner syndromes in the stable state demonstrate similar decrease in plasma norepinephrine. In the aggravated state, these changes become more expressed and are characterized by a decrease in plasma tyrosine, norepinephrine, normetanephrine and by an increase in dopamine and homovanylic acid and a decrease in excretion of norepinephrine and an increase in excretion of homovanylic acid, epinephrine and MHPG. Only in children with Kanner syndrome in the aggravated state plasma MHPG increases, excretion of tyrosine decreases and excretion of normetanephrine increases. The observed imbalance in dopamine and epinephrine/norepinephrine systems justifies combined analysis of changes in catecholamines and their metabolites levels as the most informative approach in the study of the effect of autistic disorders.

Handbook of clinical neurology	2012	James McPartland, Fred R Volkmar		The pervasive developmental disorders are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), and Rett's disorder. All feature childhood onset with a constellation of symptoms spanning social interaction and communication and including atypical behavior patterns. The first three disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD-NOS) are currently referred to as autism spectrum disorders, reflecting divergent phenotypic and etiological characteristics compared to Rett's disorder and CDD. This chapter reviews research and clinical information to appropriate medical diagnosis and treatment.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Rebecca H McNally Keehn, Alan J Lincoln, Milton Z Brown, Denise A Chavira		The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether a modified version of the Coping Cat program could be effective in reducing anxiety in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-two children (ages 8-14; IQ ≥ 70) with ASD and clinically significant anxiety were randomly assigned to 16 sessions of the Coping Cat program (cognitive-behavioral therapy; CBT) or a 16-week waitlist. Children in the CBT condition evidenced significantly larger reductions in anxiety than those in the waitlist. Treatment gains were largely maintained at two-month follow-up. Results provide preliminary evidence that a modified version of the Coping Cat program may be a feasible and effective program for reducing clinically significant levels of anxiety in children with high-functioning ASD.
22570145	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1544-6	Virtual reality social cognition training for young adults with high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2013	Michelle R Kandalaft, Nyaz Didehbani, Daniel C Krawczyk, Tandra T Allen, Sandra B Chapman		Few evidence-based social interventions exist for young adults with high-functioning autism, many of whom encounter significant challenges during the transition into adulthood. The current study investigated the feasibility of an engaging Virtual Reality Social Cognition Training intervention focused on enhancing social skills, social cognition, and social functioning. Eight young adults diagnosed with high-functioning autism completed 10 sessions across 5 weeks. Significant increases on social cognitive measures of theory of mind and emotion recognition, as well as in real life social and occupational functioning were found post-training. These findings suggest that the virtual reality platform is a promising tool for improving social skills, cognition, and functioning in autism.
22563520		Do Apparent Overlaps between Schizophrenia and Autistic Spectrum Disorders Reflect Superficial Similarities or Etiological Commonalities?	North American journal of medicine & science	2011	William S Stone, Lisa Iguchi		STUDY BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia and autism are both neurodevelopmental disorders that were once considered to be the same disorder expressed in different developmental periods. Although they were separated diagnostically about 40 years ago, they share several clinical and possibly, etiological features. This paper reviews overlaps in four domains of function to consider the issue of whether these similarities are sporadic and likely to represent superficial similarities, or whether the disorders are more likely to share some features in common. METHODS: Representative areas of function were reviewed and compared for aspects of cognition (nonverbal reasoning, memory and language), social function (orienting/joint attention, eye contact and theory of mind), brain function (structural differences) and genetics. To facilitate comparisons with schizophrenia, a focus on high functioning autism/Asperger's disorder was utilized, particularly in the sections on cognition and social function. RESULTS: Significant similarities (and differences) characterized comparisons in each domain. CONCLUSIONS: Disturbed function in similar clinical (in cognition and social function), neurobiological (brain volumes) and genetic (e.g., involvement of the same genes or chromosomal locations) domains in autism and schizophrenia supports the hypothesis that while they are distinct disorders, they are not entirely unique. Additional studies of similarities and differences between them may thus shed light on common etiological mechanisms and hopefully, facilitate the development of novel treatment targets.

Department of Neurosurgery, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, LA, USA.	A case of Asperger's syndrome with unusual cerebral pathological changes is reported. A 22-year-old male had been having diagnostic Asperger's syndrome since the age of eight and had epilepsy during the past two years. Radiological studies revealed a focal intra-axial cortical and subcortical cerebral lesion with hyper-intensity and non-enhancing contrast in the left frontal lobe. Histological and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the lesion consisted of cortical laminar disorganization, neuronal dysmorphism and increased heterotopic neurons in sub-cortical white matter. To our knowledge, this is the first case of Asperger's syndrome with focal cerebral pathological abnormalities rather than mini-columnar changes and the gyrial malformation reported in the literature.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2012	Daphne J van Steijn, Jennifer S Richards, Anoek M Oerlemans, Saskia W de Ruiter, Marcel A G van Aken, Barbara Franke, Jan K Buitelaar, Nanda N J Rommelse		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) share about 50-72% of their genetic factors, which is the most likely explanation for their frequent co-occurrence within the same patient or family. An additional or alternative explanation for the co-occurrence may be (cross-)assortative mating, e.g., the tendency to choose a partner that is similar or dissimilar to oneself. Another issue is that of parent-of-origin effect which refers to the possibility of parents differing in the relative quantity of risk factors they transmit to the offspring. The current study sets out to examine (cross-)assortative mating and (cross-)parent-of-origin effects of ASD and ADHD in parents of children with either ASD or ASD with ADHD diagnosis.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Nyaz Didehbani, Mujeeb U Shad, Michelle R Kandalaft, Tandra T Allen, Carol A Tamminga, Daniel C Krawczyk, Sandra B Chapman		A number of psychiatric illnesses have been recognized to have some level of insight deficits, including developmental disorders, such as Asperger's Syndrome (ASP). However insight into illness has not been empirically investigated in ASP and little research has examined how individuals with ASP view their deficits. This is the first study to assess insight and the relationship between insight and externalizing bias (EB) in ASP. Participants with ASP (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 24) were recruited. Attributional style was assessed with the internal, personal, and situational attribution questionnaire. Insight was assessed with both a clinician-administered and a self-administered measure. Results revealed that EB was negatively correlated with insight as assessed with the clinician-administered but not the self-administered measure of insight.

Research in developmental disabilities	2012	Anna-Lena Rumpf, Inge Kamp-Becker, Katja Becker, Christina Kauschke		The central question of the present study was whether there are differences between children with Asperger Syndrome (AS), children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and healthy controls (HC) with respect to the organization of narratives and their verbalization of internal states. Oral narrations of a wordless picture book produced by 31 children (11 with AS, 9 with ADHD, 11 HC, aged 8-12) were analyzed regarding the following linguistic variables: story length, sentence structure and sentence complexity, coherence and cohesion of the stories, verbalization of the narrator's perspective, as well as internal state language (verbal reference to mental states). Considerable similarities were noted between the two clinical groups, which deviate from HC children. Narratives of the children with AS and ADHD were shorter than the narratives produced by the HC children. The children of both clinical groups failed to point out the main aspects of the story. In particular, children with AS did not refer to cognitive states as often as the other groups. With respect to narrative coherence, they produced fewer pronominal references than HC children and children with ADHD. In conclusion, the two clinical groups differed from the HC group on a number of features, and a less frequent reference to cognitive states was identified for the children with AS.

22508080	doi: 10.55782/ane-2012-1876	An evaluation of the role and treatment of elevated male hormones in autism spectrum disorders.	Acta neurobiologiae experimentalis	2012	David A Geier, Janet K Kern, Paul G King, Lisa K Sykes, Mark R Geier		Autism, Asperger's syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) compose the overall diagnostic category of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Subjects diagnosed with an ASD have a male:female ratio of 4:1, and among subjects diagnosed with AS the male:female ratio is as high as 9:1. The purpose of this study was to examine evidence of the association between hyperandrogenism and autistic traits (ATs) among subjects diagnosed with an ASD, and to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-androgen therapy as a means to help treat ATs in subjects diagnosed with an ASD. Evidence of hyperandrogenism in subjects diagnosed with an ASD is supported by multiple studies in the areas of psychological framework, brain pathology, tissue culture, and pre- and postnatal androgen levels. Data from subjects diagnosed with other conditions associated with elevated androgens reveals many of these individuals have ATs. Finally, in a placebo-controlled trial of testosterone administration to neurotypical subjects, testosterone was found to increase ATs. In addition, a controlled trial of human transsexuals revealed a significant increase in ATs in female-to-male transsexuals and a decrease in ATs in male-to-female transsexuals. Data from multiple animals and human clinical trials suggest that antiandrogen medications have the ability to significantly reduce ATs in patients diagnosed with an ASD. In light of the robust association between hyperandrogenism and ASD, it is recommended subjects diagnosed with an ASD should undergo routine screening for elevated androgens, and appropriate treatment should be initiated for those with elevated androgens.

Fifty-three families, each consisting of a mother, father and a child, participated in this study (N=159). The 53 children in the sample included 25 children diagnosed with AS/HFA and 28 typically developing (TD) children. The Social Attribution Task (SAT) and tests assessing autistic symptoms were used. AS/HFA children had lower scores than TD children on three of the SAT indices (Person, ToM Affective, and Salience). Fathers of AS/HFA children did not have lower scores than fathers of TD children on the SAT task, whereas mothers of AS/HFA children had lower scores on the Person index, a pattern similar to seen in their children, suggesting a possible genetic contribution of mothers to ToM deficit in AS/HFA children.
22456193		Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders--Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 sites, United States, 2008.	Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Surveillance summaries (Washington, D.C. : 2002)	2012			Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disabilities characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication and by restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior. Symptoms typically are apparent before age 3 years. The complex nature of these disorders, coupled with a lack of biologic markers for diagnosis and changes in clinical definitions over time, creates challenges in monitoring the prevalence of ASDs. Accurate reporting of data is essential to understand the prevalence of ASDs in the population and can help direct research.
22450702	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1505-0	Brief report: the relationship between visual acuity, the embedded figures test and systemizing in autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Mark J Brosnan, Lucy R Gwilliam, Ian Walker		Enhanced performance upon the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has informed psychological theories of the non-social aspects that characterise ASD. The Extreme Male Brain theory of autism proposes that enhanced visual acuity underpins greater attention to detail (assessed by the EFT) which is a prerequisite for Systemizing. To date, however, no study has empirically examined these relationships. 13 males with ASD and 13 male controls were assessed upon tasks argued to reflect these levels of processing. The ASD group were found to have significantly greater visual acuity, EFT performance and Systemizing ability than the control group. However, regression analysis revealed that the strongest relationship was between visual acuity and EFT performance.

The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2012	Aniruddh Behere, Lokesh Shahani, Chad A Noggle, Raymond Dean		The study sought to identify differences in motor functioning between autism and Asperger syndrome while also assessing the diagnostic contribution of such assessment. A sample of 16 individuals with autism and 10 with Asperger syndrome completed the Dean-Woodcock Sensory-Motor Battery, and outcomes were compared. Significant differences were found in measures of cerebellar functioning, favoring Asperger subjects. Deficits in coordination, ambulation, and the Romberg test were associated with both disorders. On the basis of motor outcomes alone, 100% were accurately differentiated. Findings support the idea that motor dysfunction is a core feature of these presentations and demonstrated the utility of motor assessment in diagnostic practice.

Expert review of neurotherapeutics	2012	Samuele Cortese, Pierre Castelnau, Carmen Morcillo, Sylvie Roux, Frédérique Bonnet-Brilhault		We conducted a comprehensive review of studies assessing the efficacy and tolerability of psychostimulants for ADHD-like symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (encompassing autism disorder, Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified). PubMed, Ovid, EMBASE, Web of Science, ERIC and CINHAL were searched through 3 January 2012. From a pool of 348 potentially relevant references, 12 citations (11 studies) were retained as pertinent. Four of the included studies had a randomized controlled design. Most of the studies assessed methylphenidate immediate release. Despite inter-study heterogeneity, taken together, the results of the selected reports suggest that psychostimulants may be effective for ADHD-like symptoms in autism spectrum disorder individuals. The most common adverse events reported in the included trials were appetite reduction, sleep-onset difficulties, irritability and emotional outbursts. We discuss future directions in the field, including the need for trials assessing more ecological outcomes and combined treatment strategies tailored to the specific individual features.
22427366	doi: 10.1136/postgradmedj-2011-130727	Care of the patient with an autism spectrum disorder by the general physician.	Postgraduate medical journal	2012	Arvind Venkat, Edward Jauch, William Scott Russell, Candace Roman Crist, Robert Farrell		Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), comprising classic autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder and pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified, represent complex neurodevelopmental conditions characterised by impaired social interactions, difficulties with communication and repetitive, stereotyped behaviours. It is estimated that up to 1% of the general population may be affected by an ASD. Whether due to improved diagnostic techniques or a true rise in incidence, the prevalence of patients with ASD is rising, and these individuals are increasingly encountered in a variety of healthcare settings. Care givers of patients with an ASD report frequently that lack of awareness of the complications of these disorders and the method of appropriately assessing these individuals impair the effective delivery of healthcare to this patient population. It is now clear that patients with an ASD, in addition to the defining characteristics of these disorders, can present to the outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings with a variety of psychiatric, neurological, gastrointestinal, nutritional/metabolic, dental, ophthalmological, cardiovascular, gynaecological, traumatic and musculoskeletal conditions that can require acute intervention. In addition, the common treatments given to patients with an ASD may result in side effects and complications that may require acute intervention. For physicians who encounter patients with an ASD, the combination of impaired social interactions, difficulties with communication and stereotyped behaviours creates an additional barrier to diagnosis and treatment of these individuals. Careful preparation of the examination environment, direct engagement of care givers and the patient and the use of communication techniques and pharmacological adjuncts can aid physicians in treating the patient with an ASD in the outpatient, emergency department and inpatient settings.
22419380	doi: 10.1007/s10803-012-1498-8	Brief report: assessment of the social-emotional profile in children with autism spectrum disorders using a novel comic strip task.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Carmel S Sivaratnam, Kim Cornish, Kylie M Gray, Patricia Howlin, Nicole J Rinehart		This study investigated whether the novel Comic Strip Task (CST) could be used to detect Theory-of-Mind impairments (ToM) in 4- to 8-year-old children with high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Twelve children with either high-functioning autism or Asperger's Disorder and 12 typically-developing children completed the 21-item measure. The overall CST demonstrated moderate internal consistency but the Belief-understanding subscale was excluded from the test due to poor reliability. As predicted, the ASD group performed significantly more poorly than controls on the overall 2-subscale CST and on the intention-understanding subscale. No group differences were found in emotion-understanding subscale performance. Controlling for age, verbal ability was positively correlated with overall CST performance across groups. CST performance in the ASD group positively correlated with parent-reports of communication difficulties. Despite some limitations with the belief-understanding subscale, the CST has promising psychometric features warranting further development of this measure.

Journal of clinical child and adolescent psychology : the official journal for the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, American Psychological Association, Division 53	2012	Laura A Niditch, R Enrique Varela, Jodi L Kamps, Trenesha Hill		This study examined relations between anxiety, aggression, social understanding, IQ, and diagnosis in a sample of 231 children (ages 2-9) diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs; Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified) in a hospital setting. Children were administered tests of IQ, and parents completed measures of remaining variables. ASD diagnosis was associated with level of anxiety, and level of IQ explained this relation. IQ was significantly and positively associated with anxiety. Tests of a developmental model to explain the relation between IQ and anxiety showed that social understanding and aggression mediated the relation for toddlers. For preschool- and early elementary school-aged children, respectively, three-way interactions between IQ, social understanding, and aggression predicted anxiety, and graphs of the interactions suggest that the association between IQ and anxiety is increasingly driven by either aggression or social understanding over the course of childhood.

22382494	doi: 10.1007/s00787-012-0263-z	Quality of life of adolescents with autism spectrum disorders: comparison to adolescents with diabetes.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2012	Hélène Cottenceau, Sylvie Roux, Romuald Blanc, Pascal Lenoir, Frédérique Bonnet-Brilhault, Catherine Barthélémy		Relationships are of great importance during adolescence. Because of their social, communication and behavioral impairments, adolescents with Asperger's syndrome (AS) or high functioning autism (HFA) probably suffer from considerable impairment of their quality of life when facing their peers in school. Nevertheless, only one recent study has been published on this subject, indicating a lower health-related quality of life in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) than in healthy controls. The goals of our study were to clarify the consequences of autistic disorder without mental retardation on such adolescents' daily lives, and to consider them in comparison with the impact of a chronic somatic disease (diabetes) and with the period of adolescence itself, using the VSP-A questionnaire. Adolescents with diabetes were chosen as a comparison group because of the encumbrance of having a constant need for insulin supplementation, to be assimilated to the constant need for communicative adjustments in teenagers with ASD, and the consequences in daily life. The effects of social skill training and social support on quality of life and the appropriateness of using the VSP-A in this population were also studied. Twenty-six adolescents with AS and HFA, 44 diabetic adolescents, and 250 controls completed a self-administered and validated questionnaire on quality of life, the VSP-A. Scores for adolescents with ASD were significantly lower than those of the control and the diabetic adolescents, especially for friendships, leisure time, and affective and sexual relationships. On the other hand, better scores were obtained for the relationships with parents and teachers and for self-image. Social parameters affected the quality of life of subjects with ASD, such as having friends, regularly participating in a sport, and having the support of a school carer. For subjects with autistic spectrum disorders and without mental retardation, impairment of quality of life is significant in adolescence and young adulthood. Such adolescents are dissatisfied with their relationships, although they often have real motivation to succeed with them. Relevance of VSP-A questionnaire in these special individuals is discussed.

L'Encephale	2012	M Soussana, B Sunyer, R Pry, A Baghdadli		Anxiety is highly prevalent in Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) without mental retardation but is too often misdiagnosed. The authors suggest a critical review of current data of the PDD without mental retardation in children and adolescents, in order to summarize research published in this field. After describing specific features, this article tackles the issue of prevalence of anxiety among this population, then deals with present-time assessment and treatments of comorbid anxiety.

22359179		Brief report: driving and young adults with ASD: parents' experiences.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Neill Broderick Cox, Ronald E Reeve, Stephany M Cox, Daniel J Cox		A paucity of research exists regarding driving skills and individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The current study sought to gain a better understanding of driving and ASD by surveying parents/caregivers of adolescents/young adults with ASD who were currently attempting, or had previously attempted, to learn to drive. Respondents included 123 parents/caregivers of adolescents/young adults with ASD. The results indicate that learning to drive presents a substantial challenge for individuals with ASD; complex driving demands (e.g., multi-tasking) may be particularly problematic. Respondents provided suggestions that may be useful to others who seek to teach these skills. The survey results offer guidance for next steps in the study of driving with ASD.
22352033		[Developmental course of patients with Asperger's disorder followed objectively from infancy].	No to hattatsu = Brain and development	2012	Mieko Yoshioka, Masako Isaka		This follow-up study evaluated cognitive and language development in Asperger's disorder (AD) patients diagnosed at the age of 5 to 6 years, with initial complaints of delays in motor or language development in infancy. We evaluated 12 patients (10 males and 2 females) using two intelligence tests:Kyoto Scale of Psychological Development 2001 (K-scale) for those under 6 years, and WISC-III for those over 5-6 years. The cognitive-adaptive area (C-A) of the former test was compared to the performance IQ (PIQ) of the latter test, and the language-social area (L-S) of the former to verbal IQ (VIQ) of the latter. The mean age at the first examination was 3.2 years (range:2.1-4.6 years), and the average age at follow-up was 7.7 years (range:5.3-12.3 years). The average length of follow-up from the initial visit was 5.6 years (range:3.3-8.6 years). During follow-up, the PIQ, VIQ and full scale DQ or IQ (F-DQ/IQ) improved with age. Average scores of the 12 patients at the first examination and last follow-up evaluated by K-scale were:C-A:70.6 (first) and 84.5 (last), L-S:64.8 (first) and 85.8 (last), and F-DQ:68.5 (first) and 84.8 (last). Compared to those with AD, 12 autistic patients with the Kanner type (10 males and 2 females) who visited our clinic during almost the same period, and belonged to almost the same age group, showed average scores at the first examination and last follow-up of:C-A: 61.9 (first) and43.3 (last), L-S:43.0 (first) and43.4 (last), and F-DQ:60.2 (first) and44.5 (last). From these observations, it is apparent that AD patients also showed language delay during infancy, but they improved rapidly between the ages of 4-6 years. This developmental spurt was not seen in autistic patients with the Kanner type.
22352003		[Gender dysphoria in pervasive developmental disorders].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2011	Masaru Tateno, Hiroshi Ikeda, Toshikazu Saito		Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are characterized by two essential symptoms: impairment in social interaction, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. PDD include autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). These three disorders are sometimes termed autism spectrum disorders. A recent epidemiological survey demonstrated that the rate of PDD may be almost 1% and that many PDD cases might not be diagnosed properly in childhood. Erik Erikson described eight stages of psychosocial development through which a normally developing human should pass from infancy to adulthood. In the theory, an adolescent shows 'Identity vs. Role Confusion'. It has been reported that individuals with PDD often have identity crises which sometimes include gender dysphoria. This phenomenon might be related to the so-called identity diffusion in youth. When they reach their young youth, it has been said that subjects with PDD realize their uniqueness and differences compared to others, and, as a result, they may develop confusion of identity which could be exhibited as gender identity disorder. A recent study demonstrated that, amongst 204 children and adolescents who visited a GID clinic in the Netherlands, 7.8% were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders after a careful diagnostic procedure by a multi-disciplinary team. Taken together, PDD and GID seem closely related to each other. In this paper, we present four PDD cases with gender dysphoria and related symptoms: 1) a girl with PDD who repeatedly asserted gender identity disorder (GID) symptoms in response to social isolation at school, 2) a junior high school boy with PDD and transvestism, 3) a boy diagnosed with Asperger's disorder who developed a disturbance of sexual orientation, and 4) a boy with Asperger's disorder and comorbid childhood GID. Many of the clinical symptoms related to gender dysphoria might be explained by the cognitive characteristics and psychopathology of PDD. The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology published guidelines for the assessment and treatment of GID in 1997, and revised them in 2006. As a result, GID has become well known as a clinical entity in Japan, and there have been an increasing number of Japanese patients complaining of gender dysphoria. It is important to consider an underlying diagnosis of PDD when encountering patients with gender dysphoria.
22350451		An examination of handedness and footedness in children with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	R Markoulakis, S M Scharoun, P J Bryden, P C Fletcher		Motor control deficits have been documented in children with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS), but the extent to which these disorders affect the children's footedness must be delineated. Twelve typically developing (TD) children and 12 children with HFA/AS, ages 6-9 years, were recruited. Motor control skills were assessed through a variety of footedness tasks to determine location and nature of impairment, regarding motor dominance. Overall, greater inconsistencies in dominance arose in children with HFA/AS, through disparities in measures of preference. Results will have broader implications for understanding motor impairments in children with HFA/AS as determined by comparing performance on footedness tasks, as well as for the design of interventions to account for these deficits.
22335255	doi: 10.3109/02770903.2012.656867	Lung sound analysis in a patient with vocal cord dysfunction and bronchial asthma.	The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma	2012	Yuko Amimoto, Hiroshi Nakano, Natsuko Masumoto, Akiko Ishimatsu, Yohei Arakaki, Naohiko Taba, Yoko Murakami, Chikako Motomura, Hiroshi Odajima		Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) is a condition characterized by adduction of the vocal cords, resulting in narrowing or even closure of the glottis during inspiration. This can cause wheezing that originates at the site of narrowing. Some patients have both VCD and asthma. In such cases, an acute episode of VCD can be difficult to differentiate from that of asthma. We tested the usefulness of lung sound analysis (LSA) in such a condition.
22333911	doi: 10.1038/tpj.2012.3	Gray matter textural heterogeneity as a potential in-vivo biomarker of fine structural abnormalities in Asperger syndrome.	The pharmacogenomics journal	2013	E Radulescu, B Ganeshan, L Minati, F D C C Beacher, M A Gray, C Chatwin, R C D Young, N A Harrison, H D Critchley		Brain imaging studies contribute to the neurobiological understanding of Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC). Herein, we tested the prediction that distributed neurodevelopmental abnormalities in brain development impact on the homogeneity of brain tissue measured using texture analysis (TA; a morphological method for surface pattern characterization). TA was applied to structural magnetic resonance brain scans of 54 adult participants (24 with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 30 controls). Measures of mean gray-level intensity, entropy and uniformity were extracted from gray matter images at fine, medium and coarse textures. Comparisons between AS and controls identified higher entropy and lower uniformity across textures in the AS group. Data reduction of texture parameters revealed three orthogonal principal components. These were used as regressors-of-interest in a voxel-based morphometry analysis that explored the relationship between surface texture variations and regional gray matter volume. Across the AS but not control group, measures of entropy and uniformity were related to the volume of the caudate nuclei, whereas mean gray-level was related to the size of the cerebellar vermis. Similar to neuropathological studies, our study provides evidence for distributed abnormalities in the structural integrity of gray matter in adults with ASC, in particular within corticostriatal and corticocerebellar networks. Additionally, this in-vivo technique may be more sensitive to fine microstructural organization than other more traditional magnetic resonance approaches and serves as a future testable biomarker in AS and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
22327267	doi: 10.1177/0145445511433821	Functional communication training and chained schedules of reinforcement to treat challenging behavior maintained by terminations of activity interruptions.	Behavior modification	2012	Terry S Falcomata, Henry S Roane, Colin S Muething, Kasey M Stephenson, Anna D Ing		In this article, the authors evaluated functional communication training (FCT) and a chained schedule of reinforcement for the treatment of challenging behavior exhibited by two individuals diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and autism, respectively. Following a functional analysis with undifferentiated results, the authors demonstrated that challenging behavior was occasioned by interruptions of ongoing activities and maintained by terminations of interruptions. Next, they demonstrated the effectiveness of a treatment consisting of FCT with a chained schedule of reinforcement. Last, they modified the chained schedule procedure to increase ease of implementation and promote toleration of activity interruptions, and academic tasks were incorporated into the treatment.
22326876	doi: 10.1016/j.psychres.2011.08.024	Lateral asymmetry and reduced forward masking effect in early brainstem auditory evoked responses in schizophrenia.	Psychiatry research	2012	Johan Källstrand, Sara Fristedt Nehlstedt, Mia Ling Sköld, Sören Nielzén		Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia show deficiencies of basic neurophysiological sorting mechanisms. This study further investigated this issue, focusing on the two phenomena, laterality of coding and auditory forward masking. A specific audiometric method for use in psychiatry was the measuring set up to register brain stem audiograms (ABRs). A sample of 49 schizophrenic patients was compared with three control groups consisting of healthy reference subjects (n=49), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients (n=29), Asperger syndrome (AS) patients (n=13) and drug-induced psychotic patients (n=14). Schizophrenic patients showed significant abnormal laterality of brainstem activity in wave II of the auditory brainstem response (ABR) in comparison with all other study groups. Forward masking effects in the superior olive complex were coded significantly differently by schizophrenic patients compared to control groups except for the AS group. The results suggest deficits in the coding of auditory stimuli in the lower parts of the auditory pathway in schizophrenia and indicate that increased peripheral lateral asymmetry and forward masking aberrances could be neurophysiological markers for the disorder.
22322581		Patterns of autobiographical memory in adults with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Laura Crane, Linda Pring, Kaylee Jukes, Lorna Goddard		Two studies are presented that explored the effects of experimental manipulations on the quality and accessibility of autobiographical memories in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), relative to a typical comparison group matched for age, gender and IQ. Both studies found that the adults with ASD generated fewer specific memories than the comparison group, and took significantly longer to do so. Despite this, experimental manipulations affected two indices of autobiographical memory (specificity and retrieval latency) similarly in both groups. These results suggest that adults with ASD experience a quantitative reduction in the speed and specificity of autobiographical memory retrieval, but that when they do retrieve these memories, they do so in a way that is qualitatively similar to that of typical adults.
22315142	doi: 10.1097/MRR.0b013e32834f4d3b	Support to students with Asperger syndrome in higher education--the perspectives of three relatives and three coordinators.	International journal of rehabilitation research. Internationale Zeitschrift fur Rehabilitationsforschung. Revue internationale de recherches de readaptation	2012	Ann Simmeborn Fleischer	Jonkoping University School of Education and Communication, Jonkoping, Sweden. sfan@hlk.hj.se	An increasing number of students with disabilities attend institutes of higher education (HE). Among this group are persons with Asperger syndrome (AS). Persons with AS have a cognitive impairment that can interfere with their studies and the ability to describe their needs and ask for support. This study deals with an assessment of the support services for students with AS from the perspectives of the students' relatives and the students' service providers at the universities they attend. The aim of this study was to investigate (a) earlier experiences and events in relation to the transition of students with AS to higher education, according to the relatives' perceptions of how these experiences and events affect university studies; and (b) the perceptions of both the relatives of students with AS and the coordinators for students with disabilities with respect to the study environment and support for students with AS. The approach is a case study methodology involving relatives and university coordinators for three students with AS. The coordinators' way of working with students with disabilities is primarily based on the coordinators' own ideas. No specific organizational routines exist for students with AS. The results reveal that the needs of students with AS have to be made explicit and must be incorporated into the support system. Relatives lack information about the situation and opportunities to engage in collaboration. Universities must adapt the support system to the cognitive impairments experienced by AS students and the difficulties of their everyday lives. The relatives of students with AS may play the central role in supporting the students and in understanding their impairment.
22314575		Brief report: impaired differentiation of vegetative/affective and intentional nonverbal vocalizations in a subject with Asperger syndrome (AS).	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Susanne Dietrich, Ingo Hertrich, Andreas Riedel, Hermann Ackermann		"The Asperger syndrome (AS) includes impaired recognition of other people's mental states. Since language-based diagnostic procedures may be confounded by cognitive-linguistic compensation strategies, nonverbal test materials were created, including human affective and vegetative sounds. Depending on video context, each sound could be interpreted either as direct expression of an agent's affective/vegetative state or as result of intentional-executive mental operations. ""Situational relevance"" and ""intentionality"" ratings by a group of twelve healthy subjects nicely differentiated between context types. By contrast, an AS subject showed a systematic over-interpretation of vegetative/affective signals in terms of planned activities. Such overestimation of intentional motivation, leading to impaired social cognition, might be due to the inability to utilize ""affective resonance"" mechanisms for the interpretation of an individual's internal state."

Child development	2012	Candida C Peterson, Henry M Wellman, Virginia Slaughter		Children aged 3-12 years (n = 184) with typical development, deafness, autism, or Asperger syndrome took a series of theory-of-mind (ToM) tasks to confirm and extend previous developmental scaling evidence. A new sarcasm task, in the format of H. M. Wellman and D. Liu's (2004) 5-step ToM Scale, added a statistically reliable 6th step to the scale for all diagnostic groups. A key previous finding, divergence in task sequencing for children with autism, was confirmed. Comparisons among diagnostic groups, controlling age, and language ability, showed that typical developers mastered the 6 ToM steps ahead of each of the 3 disabled groups, with implications for ToM theories. The final (sarcasm) task challenged even nondisabled 9-year-olds, demonstrating the new scale's sensitivity to post-preschool ToM growth.

22298513	doi: 10.1002/aur.236	Disordered porphyrin metabolism: a potential biological marker for autism risk assessment.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2012	Nicholas J Heyer, Diana Echeverria, James S Woods		Autism (AUT) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that, together with Asperger's syndrome and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), comprises the expanded classification of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). The heterogeneity of ASD underlies the need to identify biomarkers or clinical features that can be employed to identify meaningful subtypes of ASD, define specific etiologies, and inform intervention and treatment options. Previous studies have shown that disordered porphyrin metabolism, manifested principally as significantly elevated urinary concentrations of pentacarboxyl (penta) and coproporphyrins, is commonly observed among some children with ASD. Here, we extend these observations by specifically evaluating penta and coproporphyrins as biological indicators of ASD among 76 male children comprising 30 with validated AUT, 14 with PDD-NOS, and 32 neurotypical (NT) controls. ASD children (AUT and PDD-NOS) had higher mean urinary penta (P < 0.006) and copro (P < 0.006) concentrations compared with same-aged NT children, each characterized by a number of extreme values. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of penta, copro, and their combined Z-scores in ASD detection. The penta sensitivity was 30% for AUT and 36% for PDD-NOS, with 94% specificity. The copro sensitivity was 33% and 14%, respectively, with 94% specificity. The combined Z-score measure had 33% and 21% sensitivity for AUT and PDD-NOS, respectively, with 100% specificity. These findings demonstrate that porphyrin measures are strong predictors of both AUT and PDD-NOS, and support the potential clinical utility of urinary porphyrin measures for identifying a subgroup of ASD subjects in whom disordered porphyrin metabolism may be a salient characteristic.

Development and psychopathology	2012	David M Williams, Dermot M Bowler, Christopher Jarrold		Evidence regarding the use of inner speech by individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is equivocal. To clarify this issue, the current study employed multiple techniques and tasks used across several previous studies. In Experiment 1, participants with and without ASD showed highly similar patterns and levels of serial recall for visually presented stimuli. Both groups were significantly affected by the phonological similarity of items to be recalled, indicating that visual material was spontaneously recoded into a verbal form. Confirming that short-term memory is typically verbally mediated among the majority of people with ASD, recall performance among both groups declined substantially when inner speech use was prevented by the imposition of articulatory suppression during the presentation of stimuli. In Experiment 2, planning performance on a tower of London task was substantially detrimentally affected by articulatory suppression among comparison participants, but not among participants with ASD. This suggests that planning is not verbally mediated in ASD. It is important that the extent to which articulatory suppression affected planning among participants with ASD was uniquely associated with the degree of their observed and self-reported communication impairments. This confirms a link between interpersonal communication with others and intrapersonal communication with self as a means of higher order problem solving.

Pediatric clinics of North America	2012	Neelkamal S Soares, Dilip R Patel		Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), also called pervasive developmental disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, Text Revised), constitute a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that coalesce around a common theme of impairments in social functioning, communication abilities, and repetitive or rigid behaviors. The ASDs considered here include autism/autistic disorder, Asperger disorder/Asperger syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. This article focuses on autism/autistic disorder screening and its early identification, with a brief mention for AS screening, as there are limited tools and no recommendation for universal screening for AS.
22278029		Attentional processing of faces in ASD: a Dot-Probe study.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	David J Moore, Lisa Heavey, John Reidy		The present study used the Dot-Probe paradigm to explore attentional allocation to faces compared with non-social images in high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing controls. There was no evidence of attentional bias in either group when stimuli were presented at individually calculated sub-threshold levels. However, at supra-threshold presentation (200 ms), a face bias was found for control participants but not for those with ASD. These results add to evidence of reduced social interest in ASD, relative to controls, and further demonstrate when atypical social processing arises in the attentional time course.

Annual International Conference	2011	Suvi Tiinanen, Antti Määttä, Minna Silfverhuth, Kalervo Suominen, Eira Jansson-Verkasalo, Tapio Seppänen		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurobiological condition which is characterized by poor skills in social communication, and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. We studied whether stress-related indices of heart rate variability (HRV) and electroencephalography (EEG) are different in children with AS than normal controls. We analyzed retrospectively the data of the test where audiovisual stimuli were used. We hypothesized that this test is a stressful situation for individuals with AS and they would have a greater reaction than control subjects. EEG and one-channel electrocardiography (ECG) were collected for children with diagnosis of AS (N = 20) and their age-matched controls (N = 21). HRV indices, frontal EEG asymmetry index and brain load index were calculated. HRV based indices revealed increased sympathetic activity during the test in children with AS. EEG based indices increased more in children with AS during the test compared to baseline. Thus, the children with AS seems to have a greater reaction to stressful situation.

Individuals with Asperger's disorder and high functioning autism often don't have diagnosis during the childhood because of their high intelligence. It is not easy to diagnose adults as pervasive developmental disorder, because the information about their state and episodes in the childhood depends on the retrospective memories by caregivers and themselves. Although some researchers proposed that biological indicators might be useful for diagnosis, they have not found reliable indicators yet. Diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorder based only on biological indicators has limitations, because pervasive developmental disorder is biologically heterogeneous, and the diagnosis criteria were made based on abnormal behaviors, but not on the biological characteristics. However it is expected that the biological indicators that are useful to diagnose will be found in the near future. The outlines of neuroimaging and eye tracking studies that are relatively simple and useful methods, including findings of our studies, are introduced in this review.

"We proposed and compared 3 cases with PDD whose clinical problems are varied according to their mental growth. Although common clinical symptoms were not found, when deciding their behavior, all of the cases have different priorities to people withoue PDD, and their relationship with social interaction was confused. Our understanding is that concept of ""developmental disorder"" may be helpful to comprehend young adults' behavioral problems, though it may have some risk for over-diagnosing."
22235552		Diagnosing autism spectrum disorders in primary care.	The Practitioner	2011	Clare S Allely, Philip Wilson		Autism is a disorder of social communication, originally described as a triad of impaired social interaction, communication, and imagination, associated with a rigid, repetitive pattern of behaviour. More recently the core deficit has been described as a lack of social instinct. The term autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes autism, atypical autism and Asperger's syndrome. According to NICE, diagnostic assessment should start within three months of referral. The decision to refer should be made on the basis of signs or symptoms. Information from all sources (i.e. medical history, parental concerns, clinical judgement) should be used to diagnose ASD based on ICD-10 or DSM-IV criteria. Clinicians should not rely on any one autism-specific diagnostic tool alone to diagnose ASD. Diagnosis is based primarily on the recognition and interpretation of behavioural symptoms. CHAT or the modified version (M-CHAT) are simple checklists that can be used for the assessment of young children in primary care when ASD is suspected. They can identify clinical features indicative of increased risk but should not be used to rule out ASD.

Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research	2012	D Dolar, A Vuković, D Ašperger, K Košutić		The production of pharmaceuticals has increased rapidly during the last several decades as they have been used for the health of both humans and animals. Routes of environmental exposure include the release of treated wastewater, the land disposal of livestock manures and municipal biosolids (i.e. sewage sludge), as well as the use of medicated aquaculture feed. This study deals with application of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes for removing of antibiotic residues (sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, dexamethasone and febantel) and their mixture. According to the results obtained in this work the use of RO (LFC-1 and XLE) and the tight NF (NF90) membranes are recommended to achieve a high level of retention (>95%) of all selected veterinary antibiotics (VAs). Nanofiltration NF270, NF and HL membranes showed a lower rejection of individual components, but much higher in a mixture solution, due to the synergistic effect.

Journal of psychiatric research	2012	Mara Parellada, Carmen Moreno, Karina Mac-Dowell, Juan Carlos Leza, Marisa Giraldez, Concepción Bailón, Carmen Castro, Patricia Miranda-Azpiazu, David Fraguas, Celso Arango		Recent evidence suggests that children with autism have impaired detoxification capacity and may suffer from chronic oxidative stress. To our knowledge, there has been no study focusing on oxidative metabolism specifically in Asperger syndrome (a milder form of autism) or comparing this metabolism with other psychiatric disorders. In this study, total antioxidant status (TAOS), non-enzymatic (glutathione and homocysteine) and enzymatic (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) antioxidants, and lipid peroxidation were measured in plasma or erythrocyte lysates in a group of adolescent patients with Asperger syndrome, a group of adolescents with a first episode of psychosis, and a group of healthy controls at baseline and at 8-12 weeks. TAOS was also analyzed at 1 year. TAOS was reduced in Asperger individuals compared with healthy controls and psychosis patients, after covarying by age and antipsychotic treatment. This reduced antioxidant capacity did not depend on any of the individual antioxidant variables measured. Psychosis patients had increased homocysteine levels in plasma and decreased copper and ceruloplasmin at baseline. In conclusion, Asperger patients seem to have chronic low detoxifying capacity. No impaired detoxifying capacity was found in the first-episode psychosis group in the first year of illness.

The occurrence of repetitive activities in patients with pervasive developmental disorders--case studies].	Psychiatria polska	2011	Anita Bryńska, Elzbieta Lipińska, Monika Matelska		Repetitive and stereotyped behaviours in the form of stereotyped interests or specific routine activities are one ofthe diagnostic criteria in pervasive developmental disorders. The occurrence of repetitive behaviours in patients with pervasive developmental disorders is a starting point for questions about the type and classification criteria of such behaviours. The aim of the article is to present case studies of patients with pervasive developmental disorders and co-morbid symptoms in the form of routine activities, tics, obsessive-compulsive symptoms or stereotyped behaviours. The first case study describes a patient with Asperger's syndrome and obsessive compulsive symptoms. The diagnostic problems regarding complex motor tics are discussed in the second case study which describes a patient with Asperger's syndrome and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. The third and fourth case study describes mono-zygotic twins with so called High Functioning Autism whose repetitive activities point to either obsessive compulsive symptoms, stereotypic movements, need for absolute consistency or echopraxia. The possible comorbidity of pervasive developmental disorders and symptoms in the form of repetitive behaviours, possible interactions as well as diagnostic challenges is discussed in the article.
22220491		[Asperger's syndrome: continuum or spectrum of autistic disorders?].	Psychiatria polska	2011	Anita Bryńska	Klinika Psychiatrii Wieku Rozwojowego WUM.	"Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PPD) refers to the group of disorders characterised by delayed or inappropriate development of multiple basic functions including socialisation, communication, behaviour and cognitive functioning. The term,,autistic spectrum disorders"" was established as a result of the magnitude of the intensity of symptoms and their proportions observed in all types of pervasive developmental disorders. Asperger's Syndrome (AS) remains the most controversial diagnosis in terms of its place within autism spectrum disorders. AS if often described as an equivalent of High Functioning Autism (HFA) or as a separate spectrum-related disorder with unique diagnostic criteria. Another important issue is the relationship between AS and speech disorders. Although it is relatively easy to draw a line between children with classical autism and speech disorders, the clear cut frontiers between them still remain to be found. The main distinguishing feature is the lack of stereotypic interests and unimpaired social interaction observed in children with speech disorders, such as semantic-pragmatic disorder."

Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2012	Randall Phelps, Debra Eisert, Susan Schulz, Marilyn Augustyn		": Alex is a 9-year-old boy brought to you, his primary care provider, for a ""fifth opinion."" You have cared for Alex since he was adopted from a Romanian orphanage at 3 years of age. He has been physically healthy with normal growth parameters and no evidence of fetal alcohol syndrome. Alex has long-standing history of social difficulties, impulsivity, lying, controlling, manipulative behaviors, violent outbursts at home with subsequent lack of remorse, and excessive chatter. You referred Alex to an interdisciplinary child development clinic 2 years ago, where he was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He was noted to have normal cognitive and language skills. Attachment therapy, stimulant therapy, and school accommodations for ADHD were recommended.Alex received some individual counseling with the school psychologist for a year after the first evaluation, with little improvement in core behaviors. The following year, Alex established care with a psychiatrist and a private counselor. The psychiatrist prescribed a succession of stimulants, each of which worked for only a short time and then had waning effect. The counselor worked with Alex and his parents on managing Alex's behavior, which the family reports has been somewhat helpful.Alex's parents express great frustration and sadness that parenting Alex has been such an ongoing struggle since he was adopted. They note that Alex is superficially friendly, chatty, and charming, with everyone he encounters, including strangers, but he never progresses past such superficial interaction, even with his adoptive parents. The parents express that they are deeply wounded that Alex is not more loving and is not more appreciative of the fact that they rescued him from the orphanage.His parents asked his pediatric clinician about Autism as they observe Alex's lack of real affection and social connection with parents or peers. They also note that Alex has difficulty verbalizing his feelings and that he lies frequently, chatters tangentially, and he can watch the Discovery channel for hours. A neurologist, to whom Alex was referred to evaluate staring spells, reassured the family that the spells did not seem to be epilepsy and also diagnosed Alex with ""Asperger's syndrome."" The school psychologist, after 2 years of equivocation, recently made Alex eligible for autism spectrum services.During the interview and examination, Alex is funny, friendly, and a bit silly. He uses normal eye contact, seems to enjoy the neuromotor examination, and is eager to show you his cool, new handshake. He engages in easy banter, using normal vernacular and prosody. After the visit, you call the therapist to express your opinion that the RAD diagnosis is valid after all and to ask whether the family is engaged in attachment therapy. The therapist refutes the RAD diagnosis, endorsing Asperger's syndrome (AS) instead and notes that Alex is making good progress in school and in therapy, where he is learning pragmatic skills and basic social skills with the use of social stories.Where do you head next?"
24498701		Gaze behavior of pre-adolescent children afflicted with Asperger syndrome.	Communication & medicine	2012	Mari Wiklund	Department of Modern Languages, University of Helsinki, Finland. mari.wiklund@helsinki.fi	Asperger syndrome (AS) is a form of high-functioning autism characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction. People afflicted with AS typically have abnormal nonverbal behaviors which are often manifested by avoiding eye contact. Gaze constitutes an important interactional resource, and an AS person's tendency to avoid eye contact may affect the fluidity of conversations and cause misunderstandings. For this reason, it is important to know the precise ways in which this avoidance is done, and in what ways it affects the interaction. The objective of this article is to describe the gaze behavior of preadolescent AS children in institutional multiparty conversations. Methodologically, the study is based on conversation analysis and a multimodal study of interaction. The findings show that three main patterns are used for avoiding eye contact: (1) fixing one's gaze straight ahead; (2) letting one's gaze wander around; and (3) looking at one's own hands when speaking. The informants of this study do not look at the interlocutors at all in the beginning or the middle of their turn. However, sometimes they turn to look at the interlocutors at the end of their turn. This proves that these children are able to use gaze as a source offeedback. When listening, looking at the speaker also seems to be easier for them than looking at the listeners when speaking

22203808	pii: 366	Yoga lessons for consciousness research: a paralimbic network balancing brain resource allocation.	Frontiers in psychology	2011	Hans C Lou, Morten Joensson, Morten L Kringelbach		"Consciousness has been proposed to play a key role in shaping flexible learning and as such is thought to confer an evolutionary advantage. Attention and awareness are the perhaps most important underlying processes, yet their precise relationship is presently unclear. Both of these processes must, however, serve the evolutionary imperatives of survival and procreation. They are thus intimately bound by reward and emotion to help to prioritize efficient brain resource allocation in order to predict and optimize behavior. Here we show how this process is served by a paralimbic network consisting primarily of regions located on the midline of the human brain. Using many different techniques, experiments have demonstrated that this network is effective and specific for self-awareness and contributes to the sense of unity of consciousness by acting as a common neural path for a wide variety of conscious experiences. Interestingly, hemodynamic activity in the network decreases with focusing on external stimuli, which has led to the idea of a default mode network. This network is one of many networks that wax and vane as resources are allocated to accommodate the different cyclical needs of the organism primarily related to the fundamental pleasures afforded by evolution: food, sex, and conspecifics. Here we hypothesize, however, that the paralimbic network serves a crucial role in balancing and regulating brain resource allocation, and discuss how it can be thought of as a link between current theories of so-called ""default mode,"" ""resting state networks,"" and ""global workspace."" We show how major developmental disorders of self-awareness and self-control can arise from problems in the paralimbic network as demonstrated here by the example of Asperger syndrome. We conclude that attention, awareness, and emotion are integrated by a paralimbic network that helps to efficiently allocate brain resources to optimize behavior and help survival."
22189963	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1430-7	The rubber hand illusion reveals proprioceptive and sensorimotor differences in autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Bryan Paton, Jakob Hohwy, Peter G Enticott		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by differences in unimodal and multimodal sensory and proprioceptive processing, with complex biases towards local over global processing. Many of these elements are implicated in versions of the rubber hand illusion (RHI), which were therefore studied in high-functioning individuals with ASD and a typically developing control group. Both groups experienced the illusion. A number of differences were found, related to proprioception and sensorimotor processes. The ASD group showed reduced sensitivity to visuotactile-proprioceptive discrepancy but more accurate proprioception. This group also differed on acceleration in subsequent reach trials. Results are discussed in terms of weak top-down integration and precision-accuracy trade-offs. The RHI appears to be a useful tool for investigating multisensory processing in ASD.

22162387	doi: 10.1002/aur.231	Audiovisual speech integration in autism spectrum disorders: ERP evidence for atypicalities in lexical-semantic processing.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2012	Odette Megnin, Atlanta Flitton, Catherine R G Jones, Michelle de Haan, Torsten Baldeweg, Tony Charman		In typically developing (TD) individuals, behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) studies suggest that audiovisual (AV) integration enables faster and more efficient processing of speech. However, little is known about AV speech processing in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This study examined ERP responses to spoken words to elucidate the effects of visual speech (the lip movements accompanying a spoken word) on the range of auditory speech processing stages from sound onset detection to semantic integration. The study also included an AV condition, which paired spoken words with a dynamic scrambled face in order to highlight AV effects specific to visual speech. Fourteen adolescent boys with ASD (15-17 years old) and 14 age- and verbal IQ-matched TD boys participated. The ERP of the TD group showed a pattern and topography of AV interaction effects consistent with activity within the superior temporal plane, with two dissociable effects over frontocentral and centroparietal regions. The posterior effect (200-300 ms interval) was specifically sensitive to lip movements in TD boys, and no AV modulation was observed in this region for the ASD group. Moreover, the magnitude of the posterior AV effect to visual speech correlated inversely with ASD symptomatology. In addition, the ASD boys showed an unexpected effect (P2 time window) over the frontocentral region (pooled electrodes F3, Fz, F4, FC1, FC2, FC3, FC4), which was sensitive to scrambled face stimuli. These results suggest that the neural networks facilitating processing of spoken words by visual speech are altered in individuals with ASD.
22162360	doi: 10.1002/aur.214	Face recognition performance of individuals with Asperger syndrome on the Cambridge Face Memory Test.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	Darren Hedley, Neil Brewer, Robyn Young		Although face recognition deficits in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), including Asperger syndrome (AS), are widely acknowledged, the empirical evidence is mixed. This in part reflects the failure to use standardized and psychometrically sound tests. We contrasted standardized face recognition scores on the Cambridge Face Memory Test (CFMT) for 34 individuals with AS with those for 42, IQ-matched non-ASD individuals, and age-standardized scores from a large Australian cohort. We also examined the influence of IQ, autistic traits, and negative affect on face recognition performance. Overall, participants with AS performed significantly worse on the CFMT than the non-ASD participants and when evaluated against standardized test norms. However, while 24% of participants with AS presented with severe face recognition impairment (>2 SDs below the mean), many individuals performed at or above the typical level for their age: 53% scored within +/- 1 SD of the mean and 9% demonstrated superior performance (>1 SD above the mean). Regression analysis provided no evidence that IQ, autistic traits, or negative affect significantly influenced face recognition: diagnostic group membership was the only significant predictor of face recognition performance. In sum, face recognition performance in ASD is on a continuum, but with average levels significantly below non-ASD levels of performance.
22160371	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1415-6	Just another social scene: evidence for decreased attention to negative social scenes in high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Andreia Santos, Thierry Chaminade, David Da Fonseca, Catarina Silva, Delphine Rosset, Christine Deruelle		The adaptive threat-detection advantage takes the form of a preferential orienting of attention to threatening scenes. In this study, we compared attention to social scenes in 15 high-functioning individuals with autism (ASD) and matched typically developing (TD) individuals. Eye-tracking was recorded while participants were presented with pairs of scenes, either emotional positive-neutral, emotional negative-neutral or neutral-neutral scenes. Early allocation of attention, the first image fixated in each pair, differed between groups: contrary to TD individuals who showed the typical threat-detection advantage towards negative images, the ASD group failed to show a bias toward threat-related scenes. Later processing of stimuli, indicated by the total fixation to the images during the 3-s presentation, was found unaffected in the ASD group. These results support the hypothesis of an early atypical allocation of attention towards natural social scenes in ASD, that is compensated in later stages of visual processing.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Kelly S Wild, Ellen Poliakoff, Andrew Jerrison, Emma Gowen		To investigate how people with Autism are affected by the presence of goals during imitation, we conducted a study to measure movement kinematics and eye movements during the imitation of goal-directed and goal-less hand movements. Our results showed that a control group imitated changes in movement kinematics and increased the level that they tracked the hand with their eyes, in the goal-less compared to goal-direction condition. In contrast, the ASD group exhibited more goal-directed eye movements, and failed to modulate the observed movement kinematics successfully in either condition. These results increase the evidence for impaired goal-less imitation in ASD, and suggest that there is a reliance on goal-directed strategies for imitation in ASD, even in the absence of visual goals.
22141191		Infantile autism: a chronic psychosis since infancy due to synaptic pruning of the supplementary motor area.	Nutrition and health	2011	Letten F Saugstad	Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oslo.	"The rise in infantile autism, learning problems, cognitive decline with age, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's diseases and the SIDS epidemic, has a common cause in the rising dietary deficit in Omega-3 brain-food. This paper suggests that aside from the wider concept of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), the rise in infantile autism (IA) in the last decade is the effect of deficient brain-food (Omega-3). The consequent delay of development, prolongs the 2nd regressive event in infancy to pruning of the centre in the Medial Frontal Lobe System that connects hippocampus and singulum. With a consequently defective supplementary motor area (SMA), the Delayed Response Function is affected leading to persistent psychosis. Post-pubertal episodic psychoses are associated with acute reduction of excitation, a risk of breakdown of circuitry, insufficient fill-in mechanisms, and silent spots. An acute psychosis occurs if the silent spots compromise SMA. Only two brain areas have continuous neurogenesis, indicating their important functions: the Hippocampus and Olfactory Bulb that belongs to the lateral frontal lobe system essential to survival. Concerned with necessity of action in response to the environment, it relies upon short-term memory and acute feedback mechanisms influenced by emotion and motivation from the external world. In contrast, the medial frontal lobe network is controlled by feed-forward predictive mechanisms related to storage of information The Delayed Response Function is mastered at 7 months, when 2nd event occurs with pruning of axons and dendrites. An abolished or defective delayed response function seriously incapacitates an individual: a defective ""social brain"" with an inability for conscious action and to communicate, predominates in IA. There is a near lack of speech, despite normal vision and hearing in the minority without marked adversity in pregnancy, at delivery or in infancy. The recent rise in IA despite no rise in adversity signifies a rising deficiency in brain-food. This is suggested by a changing clinical picture: no Mental Retardation in an IA majority. Deficit in olfaction is pathognomonic in schizophrenia since 30 yrs and distinguishes the Asperger syndrome. If brain-food deficiency alone sufficiently prolongs pruning to cause absent activity in SMA in infancy, less mentally retarded IA from other causes might be observed. Deficit in brain-food was evident in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: birthweight averaged 200-300g lower than sibs, Omega-3 levels in brainstem were lower than controls. Only 20% SIDS died in first hypoxic episode, suggesting such episodes are more frequent than we imagined. Children with learning-behaviour problems have similarly depressed birthweight. A general deficiency in omega-3 contributes to the lacking reduction in Schizophrenia, despite early puberty predominates. Olfactory bulb is first affected in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Cognitive decline with age, hippocampal dysfunctions rises markedly irrespective of disease, but the major mental illnesses and Infantile Autism in particular, benefit from ""brainfood"" that might also prevent a development of these disorders. To secure optimal brain function in the coming generations, there is a need to change the diet now from its emphasis on protein for body growth to food for the brain. This means there is a need to increase fish and sea food consumption."

22128537		Effect of water matrices on removal of veterinary pharmaceuticals by nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes.	Journal of environmental sciences (China)	2011	Davor Dolar, Ana Vuković, Danijela Asperger, Kresimir Kosutić		This study explored the removal of five veterinary pharmaceuticals (VPs) (sulfamethoxazole (SMETOX), trimethoprim (TMP), ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), dexamethasone (DEXA) and febantel (FEBA)) from different water matrices (Milli-Q water, model water, tap water and real pharmaceutical wastewater using four types of nanofiltration (NF) membranes (NF90, NF270, NF and HL) and two reverse osmosis (RO) membranes (LFC-1 and XLE). All VPs were added to different water matrices at a concentration of 10 mg/L. Rejections of VPs and water flux were measured. The rejection increased with increase of molecular weight. The highest rejections were obtained with RO membranes (LFC-1, XLE) and tight NF (NF90) membrane. In general, the rejection of VPs was higher in model water and tap water than in Milli-Q water, but the water flux was lower. This was mainly explained by ion adsorption inside the membranes pores. Narrower pore size counteracted the effect of presence of low concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) in tap water. The NOM was assumed to enhance the adsorption of VPs onto membrane surface, increased the size exclusion and electrostatic repulsion also appeared during the transport. Investigated water matrices had influence on water flux decline due to their complexity.

Clinical psychopharmacology and neuroscience : the official scientific journal of the Korean College of Neuropsychopharmacology	2011	Gonca Celik, Aysegul Yolga Tahiroglu, Sunay Firat, Ayşe Avci		There are many comorbid disorders associated with autism spectrum disorders in child and adolescent population. Although obsessive compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) comorbidity has common in clinical practice, there are few reports about psychopharmacological treatment for obsessive compulsive symptoms in children with ASD in the literacy. We report a successful treatment case with aripiprazole in Asperger's Disorder with obsessive compulsive symptoms. The Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale was performed to assess symptom variety. This case report supports the effectiveness of aripiprazole in treatment of obsessive compulsive symptoms in Asperger's Disorder or ASDs. Aripiprazole may be beneficial to obsessive compulsive disorder comorbid autism spectrum disorders in child and adolescent age group.
22119700	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.10.016	Cortical activation during attention to sound in autism spectrum disorders.	Research in developmental disabilities	2012	Yasuko Funabiki, Toshiya Murai, Motomi Toichi		Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) can demonstrate hypersensitivity to sounds as well as a lack of awareness of them. Several functional imaging studies have suggested an abnormal response in the auditory cortex of such subjects, but it is not known whether these subjects have dysfunction in the auditory cortex or are simply not listening. We measured changes in blood oxygenated hemoglobin (OxyHb) in the prefrontal and temporal cortices using near-infrared spectroscopy during various listening and ignoring tasks in 11 ASD and 12 control subjects. Here we show that the auditory cortex in ASD subjects responds to sounds fully during attention. OxyHb in the auditory cortex increased with intentional listening but not with ignoring of the same auditory stimulus in a similar fashion in both groups. Cortical responses differed not in the auditory but in the prefrontal region between the ASD and control groups. Thus, unawareness to sounds in ASD could be interpreted as due to inattention rather than dysfunction of the auditory cortex. Difficulties in attention control may account for the contrary behaviors of hypersensitivity and unawareness to sound in ASD.

Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2011	Masatoshi Shibayama	Department of Psychology, Tokyo Woman's Christian University.	"The differential diagnosis of dissociative disorders includes many psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorders (especially bipolar II disorder), depressive disorder (especially atypical depression), epilepsy, Asperger syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. The theme of this paper is the differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia. Schneiderian first-rank symptoms in schizophrenia are common in dissociative disorders, especially in dissociative identity disorder (DID). Many DID patients have been misdiagnosed as schizophrenics and treated with neuroleptics. We compared and examined Schneiderian symptoms of schizophrenia and those of dissociative disorders from a structural viewpoint. In dissociative disorders, delusional perception and somatic passivity are not seen. ""Lateness"" and ""Precedence of the Other"" originated from the concept of ""Pattern Reversal"" (H. Yasunaga)"" is characteristic of schizophrenia. It is important to check these basic structure of schizophrenia in subjective experiences in differential diagnosis between dissociative disorders and schizophrenia."

Neurocase	2012	Vilayanur S Ramachandran, Luke Miller, Margaret S Livingstone, David Brang		The claim that some individuals see colored halos or auras around faces has long been part of popular folklore. Here we report on a 23-year-old man (subject TK) diagnosed with Asperger's disorder, who began to consistently experience colors around individuals at the age of 10. TK's colors are based on the individual's identity and emotional connotation. We interpret these experiences as a form of synesthesia, and confirm their authenticity through a target detection paradigm. Additionally, we investigate TK's claim that emotions evoke highly specific colors, allowing him, despite his Asperger's, to introspect on emotions and recognize them in others.

Brain & development	2012	Tatsuo Mori, Kenji Mori, Emiko Fujii, Yoshihiro Toda, Masahito Miyazaki, Masafumi Harada, Toshiaki Hashimoto, Shoji Kagami		To evaluate the GABA(A) receptor in the autistic brain, we performed (123)I-IMZ SPECT in patients with ASD. We compared (123)I-IMZ SPECT abnormalities in patients who showed intellectual disturbance or focal epileptic discharge on EEG to those in patients without such findings.
22093691		Early manifestations of autism spectrum disorders. Experience of 393 cases in a paediatric neurology.	Neurologia (Barcelona, Spain)	2012	A Bravo Oro, J Vázquez Briseño, C A Cuello García, R F Calderón Sepúlveda, A M Hernández Villalobos, C Esmer Sánchez		Autism spectrum disorders are group of conditions characterised by qualitative impairments in social communication, interaction, and imagination, and by a restricted range of interests and typical repetitive behaviours. Frequently, there is a delay in the age of detection, and therefore in starting multidisciplinary evaluations and interventions, which may result in a poorer prognosis and reduced quality of life for both children and parents. The aim of our study was to describe clinical and epidemiological data including the age of detection and main initial complaints present in children with autism disorders referred to a paediatric neurology centre.
22087045	doi: 10.1177/1362361311423384	A social competence intervention for young children with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome: a pilot study.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2012	Elizabeth Portman Minne, Margaret Semrud-Clikeman		The key features of Asperger Syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA) include marked and sustained impairment in social interactions. A multi-session, small group program was developed to increase social perception based on the assumption perceptual or interpretive problems underlying these social difficulties. Additionally, the group format espoused a play therapy orientation and the use of sociodramatic play was the primary therapeutic modality used. Qualitative analyses of the data resulted in an explanation of the key changes in social interactions that took place through the course of the intervention. Although each participant's experience in this group was unique, all children in this program demonstrated improvements in their social interactions, as they experienced development both emotionally and behaviorally. Findings suggest that, despite their rigid interests and behavior patterns, the social limitations of these children improved when provided with the necessary environmental resources.
22087041	doi: 10.1177/1362361311422530	Learning of idiomatic language expressions in a group intervention for children with autism.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2013	Elisabeth M Whyte, Keith E Nelson, Kiren S Khan		In typical development, children learn an extensive range of idioms and other figurative (non-literal) language expressions during childhood and adolescence. However, many children with autism fall far behind in their idiom comprehension and production and never fully reach adult levels. The current study measured the effectiveness of a group idiom intervention for ten children, aged 7 to 12 years, with autism spectrum disorders. This intervention was conducted by a community-based social skills program. The children were initially very low in idiom understanding, but were able to learn and remember the meaning of idiomatic phrases that they were taught during the 2-week-long intervention. The children showed greater increases at a delayed post-test for idioms trained in the intervention than idioms that were untrained controls. Implications for future educational possibilities are discussed.

Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie	2012	F-G Lehnhardt, A Gawronski, K Volpert, L Schilbach, R Tepest, K Vogeley		The first time diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) after passing childhood and adolescence is still considered a rare event. However, in recent years an increasing demand for diagnostic clarifications with suspected ASD in adulthood challenges this view. There is insufficient knowledge about the neuropsychological characterisation and psychosocial outcome of this adult subgroup in the autistic spectrum.

Evidence from biochemical, imaging, and treatment studies suggest abnormalities of the serotonin system in autism spectrum disorders, in particular in frontolimbic areas of the brain. We used the radiotracers [(11)C]MDL 100907 and [(11)C]DASB to characterize the 5-HT(2A) receptor and serotonin transporter in Asperger's Disorder. Seventeen individuals with Asperger's Disorder (age=34.3 ± 11.1 years) and 17 healthy controls (age=33.0 ± 9.6 years) were scanned with [(11)C]MDL 100907. Of the 17 patients, eight (age=29.7 ± 7.0 years) were also scanned with [¹¹C]DASB, as were eight healthy controls (age=28.7 ± 7.0 years). Patients with Asperger's Disorder and healthy control subjects were matched for age, gender, and ethnicity, and all had normal intelligence. Metabolite-corrected arterial plasma inputs were collected and data analyzed by two-tissue compartment modeling. The primary outcome measure was regional binding potential BP(ND). Neither regional [¹¹C]MDL 100907 BP(ND) nor [¹¹C]DASB BP(ND) was statistically different between the Asperger's and healthy subjects. This study failed to find significant alterations in binding parameters of 5-HT(2A) receptors and serotonin transporters in adult subjects with Asperger's disorder.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Satu Saalasti, Jari Kätsyri, Kaisa Tiippana, Mari Laine-Hernandez, Lennart von Wendt, Mikko Sams		Audiovisual speech perception was studied in adults with Asperger syndrome (AS), by utilizing the McGurk effect, in which conflicting visual articulation alters the perception of heard speech. The AS group perceived the audiovisual stimuli differently from age, sex and IQ matched controls. When a voice saying /p/ was presented with a face articulating /k/, the controls predominantly heard /k/. Instead, the AS group heard /k/ and /t/ with almost equal frequency, but with large differences between individuals. There were no differences in gaze direction or unisensory perception between the AS and control participants that could have contributed to the audiovisual differences. We suggest an explanation in terms of weak support from the motor system for audiovisual speech perception in AS.

Given the clinical heterogeneity of ASD, treatment approaches are multidisciplinary including alternative therapies, particularly when no pharmaceutical agent is effective for the core symptoms of ASD. Chiropractic is a popular alternative therapy for children. A systematic review of the literature was performed to provide context for future research endeavors in this field.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Jennifer L Barnes, Simon Baron-Cohen		Previous work on story-telling ability in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) has found a pattern of relatively intact use of story grammar in ASC narratives; however, prior analysis has concentrated primarily on whether specific story components are included, rather than how they are included. The present study analyzes an existing narrative dataset, concentrating on the kind of information that individuals with and without high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome include about story elements such as setting, character, conflict, and resolution. This analysis showed that individuals with ASC are biased toward providing local over global details about each element, regardless of whether the element involved mental content. These results are discussed in terms of the Weak Central Coherence and Hyper-Systemizing theories.

Advances in medical sciences	2011	Y Jiao, R Chen, X Ke, L Cheng, K Chu, Z Lu, E H Herskovits		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, of which Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are subtypes. Our goal is: 1) to determine whether a diagnostic model based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), brain regional thickness measurements, or brain regional volume measurements can distinguish Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism; and 2) to compare the SNP, thickness, and volume-based diagnostic models.

Indian journal of psychological medicine	2011	Nishalie Fernandopulle	Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Children's Resource Centre/Lanka Hospitals Limited, Colombo, Sri Lanka.	Using a key word search on electronic databases, two relevant journals and relevant review references, four measures of autistic symptoms (Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test, Autism Behavior Checklist, Social Communication Questionnaire, Social Responsiveness Scale) were reviewed with reference to their ability to discriminate the three major components of autism and measure across the whole spectrum of autism. None of the reviewed measures were able to effectively tap into and differentiate between all points on the spectrum. Further work is required to assess the sensitivity of the measures to independence between domains. The development of a measure sensitive to symptom change/continuity across development may be useful.

For this diagnostic group of patients, often characterised by normal or above-average intelligence, i.e, high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome, only few adequate psychotherapeutic treatment options exist. In order to develop a disorder-specific psychotherapeutic group training in a demand-oriented manner, we surveyed adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) concerning their needs and expectations relating to psychotherapy.

Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja	2011	Petra Waris, Tuula Kulomäki, Pekka Tani		Literature on Asperger's syndrome (AS) has mainly described symptoms that are manifested in boys. Only recently, attention has been paid on the features in AS girls that differ from the typical clinical picture and may complicate the detection of the syndrome. Because AS girls may react passively in general or compensate or hide their difficulties by other abilities, the need for support is not necessarily brought up. In that case this developmental disorder easily remains unrecognized. Recognition of the syndrome at an early stage makes early supportive actions possible.
21991394	pii: e25372	The level and nature of autistic intelligence II: what about Asperger syndrome?	PloS one	2011	Isabelle Soulières, Michelle Dawson, Morton Ann Gernsbacher, Laurent Mottron		A distinctively uneven profile of intelligence is a feature of the autistic spectrum. Within the spectrum, Asperger individuals differ from autistics in their early speech development and in being less likely to be characterized by visuospatial peaks. While different specific strengths characterize different autistic spectrum subgroups, all such peaks of ability have been interpreted as deficits: isolated, aberrant, and irreconcilable with real human intelligence. This view has recently been challenged by findings of autistic strengths in performance on Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), an important marker of general and fluid intelligence. We investigated whether these findings extend to Asperger syndrome, an autistic spectrum subgroup characterized by verbal peaks of ability, and whether the cognitive mechanisms underlying autistic and Asperger RPM performance differ. Thirty-two Asperger adults displayed a significant advantage on RPM over Wechsler Full-Scale and Performance scores relative to their typical controls, while in 25 Asperger children an RPM advantage was found over Wechsler Performance scores only. As previously found with autistics, Asperger children and adults achieved RPM scores at a level reflecting their Wechsler peaks of ability. Therefore, strengths in RPM performance span the autistic spectrum and imply a common mechanism advantageously applied to different facets of cognition. Autistic spectrum intelligence is atypical, but also genuine, general, and underestimated.
21987799	doi: 10.1073/pnas.1107038108	Insensitivity to social reputation in autism.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2011	Keise Izuma, Kenji Matsumoto, Colin F Camerer, Ralph Adolphs		People act more prosocially when they know they are watched by others, an everyday observation borne out by studies from behavioral economics, social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. This effect is thought to be mediated by the incentive to improve one's social reputation, a specific and possibly uniquely human motivation that depends on our ability to represent what other people think of us. Here we tested the hypothesis that social reputation effects are selectively impaired in autism, a developmental disorder characterized in part by impairments in reciprocal social interactions but whose underlying cognitive causes remain elusive. When asked to make real charitable donations in the presence or absence of an observer, matched healthy controls donated significantly more in the observer's presence than absence, replicating prior work. By contrast, people with high-functioning autism were not influenced by the presence of an observer at all in this task. However, both groups performed significantly better on a continuous performance task in the presence of an observer, suggesting intact general social facilitation in autism. The results argue that people with autism lack the ability to take into consideration what others think of them and provide further support for specialized neural systems mediating the effects of social reputation.

This program is implemented in different regions in Québec. The evaluation takes into consideration working conditions, integration procedures, as well as receptivity of eventual employers. Results demonstrate that the working conditions for these individuals are relatively similar, however, the type and number of services offered, as well as the training of service agents vary from one centre to another.
21980823		Asperger's disorder and Williams syndrome: a case report.	The Turkish journal of pediatrics	2011	Ayse Kilinçaslan, Canan Tanidir, Mustafa Deniz Tutkunkardaş, Nahit Motavalli Mukaddes		Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic disorder caused by the hemizygous microdeletion in chromosome 7q11.23. It is characterized by dysmorphic face, cardiovascular disease, idiopathic hypercalcemia, mental retardation, and an uneven profile of cognitive-linguistic abilities and deficits. The presence of autistic features in individuals with WS is a controversial issue. While there are reports that describe them as overly friendly with excessive sociability and good empathic skills, some recent studies focus more on the qualitative impairment of their social abilities. Here, we report the clinical presentation and follow-up of an eight-year-old boy with WS and clear problems in his social interaction, non-verbal communication and circumscribed interests. To our knowledge, this is the first case report on the coexistence of WS and Asperger's disorder. It also differs from previous papers on the comorbidity of WS and autism spectrum disorders, by depicting a highly verbal, nonretarded child followed for seven years through adolescence.
21975036	doi: 10.1177/1362361311418690	Autobiographical memory in adults with autism spectrum disorder: the role of depressed mood, rumination, working memory and theory of mind.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2013	Laura Crane, Lorna Goddard, Linda Pring		Autobiographical memory difficulties have been widely reported in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The aim of the current study was to explore the potential correlates of autobiographical memory performance (including depressed mood, rumination, working memory and theory of mind) in adults with ASD, relative to a group of typical adults matched for age, gender and IQ. Results demonstrated that the adults with ASD reported higher levels of depressed mood and rumination than the typical adults, and also received lower scores on measures of theory of mind and working memory. Correlational analysis suggested that theory of mind and working memory were associated with autobiographical memory performance in the adults with ASD, but no significant relationships were observed between autobiographical memory, depressed mood and rumination in this group. To explore these patterns further, two cases of adults with a dual diagnosis of ASD and depression are discussed. These participants present a profile in line with the idea that depressed mood and rumination do not have the same influence on autobiographical memory in adults with ASD as they do in typical adults.

A prominent explanatory model suggests that social-relating symptoms may arise from dysfunction within the mirror neuron system, while a recent neuroimaging study suggests that these impairments in ASD might reduce with age.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2012	Kristen Lyall, David L Pauls, Donna Spiegelman, Alberto Ascherio, Susan L Santangelo		The authors examined pregnancy and obstetric complications in association with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children of participants from the Nurses' Health Study II, a prospective national cohort with information collected through biennial mailed questionnaires since 1989. Logistic regression was used to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios for ASD, and by diagnostic subgroup. Seven hundred and ninety-three cases were reported among 66,445 pregnancies. Pregnancy complications and obstetric suboptimality factors were assessed by maternal report of occurrence in first birth and, in secondary analyses, in any birth. Complications and a suboptimality score were significantly associated with having a child with ASD (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26, 1.77, P<0.0001 for pregnancy complications in first birth and 2.76, 95% CI 2.04, 3.74, P<0.0001 comparing individuals with four or more obstetric suboptimality factors in first birth to those with none; results similar when assessed in any birth). In particular, gestational diabetes was associated with a significantly increased risk of ASD in results of primary and sensitivity analyses (OR in primary analysis = 1.76, 95% CI 1.34, 2.32, P<0.0001); suboptimal parity and suboptimal age-at-first-birth were also individual factors associated with ASD. Associations were similar by diagnostic subgroup, suggesting autism, Asperger syndrome, and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders are all associated with pregnancy complications. Consistent with previous research, the general class of pregnancy complications was associated with ASD as a whole. Additional work will be required to more fully assess the role of gestational diabetes.

Scandinavian journal of psychology	2011	Shari Hirvelä, Klaus Helkama		The aims of this study were, first, to re-address the issue of empathy among people with autism conditions; second, to explore the relationships between empathy and values among autistic populations and controls; and third, to explore the capacity for moral agency among those affected by autism. We compared responses of an Asperger group (N = 41) and a control group (N = 139) to measures of self-reported empathy (Davis's IRI) and value priorities (Schwartz's PVQ). Control group results were largely in line with previous studies, such that empathy subscales of perspective taking and empathic concern showed their strongest positive and negative relations to the Schwartz self-transcendence/self-enhancement dimensions. Results for the Asperger group showed that although on the one hand there were self-reported difficulties in perspective taking and the cognitive recognition of affect, and that on the other hand there were less connections between the empathy and value measures, there was nevertheless a comparable prioritization of moral values. Conclusions suggest that different people may acquire moral values through different mechanisms.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2012	Christina Samios, Kenneth I Pakenham, Kate Sofronoff		Parents of children with Asperger syndrome face many challenges that may lead them to search for meaning by developing explanations for (sense making) and finding benefits (benefit finding) in having a child with special needs. Although family theorists have proposed that finding meaning occurs interpersonally, there is a dearth of empirical research that has examined finding meaning at the couple level. This study examined sense making and benefit finding in 84 couples who have a child with Asperger syndrome by using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (Kenny et al., 2006) to examine actor effects (i.e. the extent to which an individual's score on the predictor variable impacts his or her own level of adjustment) and partner effects (i.e. the extent to which an individual's score on the predictor variable has an impact on his or her partner's level of adjustment) of sense making and benefit finding on parental adjustment. Results demonstrated that parents' benefit finding related to greater anxiety and parents' sense making related to not only their own adjustment but also their partner's adjustment. Results highlight the importance of adopting an interpersonal perspective on finding meaning and adjustment. Limitations, future research and clinical implications are also discussed.
21949004	doi: 10.1177/1362361311418692	Motor proficiency and emotional/behavioural disturbance in autism and Asperger's disorder: another piece of the neurological puzzle?	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2012	Nicole Papadopoulos, Jennifer McGinley, Bruce Tonge, John Bradshaw, Kerryn Saunders, Anna Murphy, Nicole Rinehart		The relationship of motor proficiency with emotional/behavioural disturbance, autistic symptoms and communication disturbance was investigated in children diagnosed with autism and Asperger's disorder (AD). The Movement Assessment Battery for Children was used as a measure of motor impairment, and the Developmental Behavioural Checklist was used as a measure of emotional/behavioural disturbance in the following groups: AD (n = 22), high functioning autism (HFA) (n = 23), LFA (n = 8) and typically developing children (n = 20). The HFA group had more difficulty with motor items, such as ball skills and balance, than did the AD group. There were significant positive correlations between impairments in motor proficiency (in particular ball skills and balance) and emotional/behavioural disturbance, autistic symptoms and communication disturbance. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that there are qualitative and quantitative differences in the motor profile between autism and AD. In addition, the association between motor proficiency impairment and emotional/behavioural disturbance in autism and AD emphasizes the importance for screening of co-occurring emotional/behavioural symptoms in individuals with motor difficulties. These findings have implications for the potential use of adjunct motor measures in the diagnosis and definition of autism spectrum disorders.
21948742	doi: 10.1002/aur.227	Anatomy and aging of the amygdala and hippocampus in autism spectrum disorder: an in vivo magnetic resonance imaging study of Asperger syndrome.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2012	Clodagh M Murphy, Q Deeley, E M Daly, C Ecker, F M O'Brien, B Hallahan, E Loth, F Toal, S Reed, S Hales, D M Robertson, M C Craig, D Mullins, G J Barker, T Lavender, P Johnston, K C Murphy, D G Murphy		It has been proposed that people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have abnormal morphometry and development of the amygdala and hippocampus (AH). However, previous reports are inconsistent, perhaps because they included people of different ASD diagnoses, ages, and health. We compared, using magnetic resonance imaging, the in vivo anatomy of the AH in 32 healthy individuals with Asperger syndrome (12-47 years) and 32 healthy controls who did not differ significantly in age or IQ. We measured bulk (gray + white matter) volume of the AH using manual tracing (MEASURE). We first compared the volume of AH between individuals with Asperger syndrome and controls and then investigated age-related differences. We compared differences in anatomy before, and after, correcting for whole brain size. There was no significant between group differences in whole brain volume. However, individuals with Asperger syndrome had a significantly larger raw bulk volume of total (P<0.01), right (P<0.01), and left amygdala (P<0.05); and when corrected for overall brain size, total (P<0.05), and right amygdala (P<0.01). There was a significant group difference in aging of left amygdala; controls, but not individuals with Asperger syndrome, had a significant age-related increase in volume (r = 0.486, P<0.01, and r = 0.007, P = 0.97, z = 1.995). There were no significant group differences in volume or age-related effects in hippocampus.

21938563	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1365-z	The impact of bilingual environments on language development in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Catherine Hambly, Eric Fombonne		The impact of bilingual exposure on language learning has not been systematically studied in children with Autism Spectrum Disorders. This study compared the social abilities and language levels of children (mean age = 56 months) with ASDs from bilingual (n = 45) and monolingual (n = 30) environments. Bilingually-exposed children were subgrouped based on simultaneous bilingual exposure from infancy (SIM, n = 24) versus sequential post-infancy bilingual exposure (SEQ, n = 21). Despite significantly different amounts of bilingual exposure across all groups (p = <0.001) and significantly stronger social interaction scores in the SIM group compared to the SEQ group on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II Interpersonal subdomain (p = 0.025), there were no significant group differences in language level. Bilingually-exposed children with ASDs did not experience additional delays in language development.

A systematic review of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging studies.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Laura Pina-Camacho, Sonia Villero, David Fraguas, Leticia Boada, Joost Janssen, Francisco J Navas-Sánchez, Maria Mayoral, Cloe Llorente, Celso Arango, Mara Parellada		A systematic review of 208 studies comprising functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging data in patients with 'autism spectrum disorder' (ASD) was conducted, in order to determine whether these data support the forthcoming DSM-5 proposal of a social communication and behavioral symptom dyad. Studies consistently reported abnormal function and structure of fronto-temporal and limbic networks with social and pragmatic language deficits, of temporo-parieto-occipital networks with syntactic-semantic language deficits, and of fronto-striato-cerebellar networks with repetitive behaviors and restricted interests in ASD patients. Therefore, this review partially supports the DSM-5 proposal for the ASD dyad.

Social neuroscience	2011	Shota Uono, Wataru Sato, Motomi Toichi		Several studies have examined facial expression recognition in pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), including autism and Asperger's disorder, but the results have been inconsistent. We investigated the relationship between facial expression recognition and age, face recognition, and symptom severity. Subjects were 28 individuals with mild PDD subtypes and 28 age- and gender-matched controls. Among six emotions, fearful expression recognition was specifically impaired in PDD subjects. Age had positive effects on fearful expression recognition directly and indirectly via the development of face recognition in controls, but not in PDD subjects. Furthermore, fearful expression recognition was related to the severity of PDD symptoms. We conclude that individuals with PDD show an atypical development of facial expression recognition. Moreover, impaired fearful expression recognition is closely related to social dysfunction.

Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006)	2011	C Ellie Wilson, Romina Palermo, A Mike Burton, Jon Brock		Empirical data regarding the extent of face recognition abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is inconsistent. Here, 27 ASD and 47 typically developing (TD) children completed an immediate two-alternative forced-choice identity matching task. We contrasted recognition of own- and other-race faces, and, counter to prediction, we found a typical advantage for recognizing own- over other-race faces in both the ASD and TD groups. In addition, ASD and TD groups responded similarly to stimulus manipulations (use of identical or different photographs for identity matching and cropping stimuli to remove hair information). However, age-standardized scores varied widely within the ASD sample, and a subgroup of ASD participants with impaired face recognition did not exhibit a significant own-race recognition advantage. An explanation regarding early experience with faces is considered, and implications for research of individual variation within ASD are discussed.

21886617	pii: 77	A learning-style theory for understanding autistic behaviors.	Frontiers in human neuroscience	2011	Ning Qian, Richard M Lipkin		Understanding autism's ever-expanding array of behaviors, from sensation to cognition, is a major challenge. We posit that autistic and typically developing brains implement different algorithms that are better suited to learn, represent, and process different tasks; consequently, they develop different interests and behaviors. Computationally, a continuum of algorithms exists, from lookup table (LUT) learning, which aims to store experiences precisely, to interpolation (INT) learning, which focuses on extracting underlying statistical structure (regularities) from experiences. We hypothesize that autistic and typical brains, respectively, are biased toward LUT and INT learning, in low- and high-dimensional feature spaces, possibly because of their narrow and broad tuning functions. The LUT style is good at learning relationships that are local, precise, rigid, and contain little regularity for generalization (e.g., the name-number association in a phonebook). However, it is poor at learning relationships that are context dependent, noisy, flexible, and do contain regularities for generalization (e.g., associations between gaze direction and intention, language and meaning, sensory input and interpretation, motor-control signal and movement, and social situation and proper response). The LUT style poorly compresses information, resulting in inefficiency, sensory overload (overwhelm), restricted interests, and resistance to change. It also leads to poor prediction and anticipation, frequent surprises and over-reaction (hyper-sensitivity), impaired attentional selection and switching, concreteness, strong local focus, weak adaptation, and superior and inferior performances on simple and complex tasks. The spectrum nature of autism can be explained by different degrees of LUT learning among different individuals, and in different systems of the same individual. Our theory suggests that therapy should focus on training autistic LUT algorithm to learn regularities.

Biological psychiatry	2011	Marita Falkmer, Geoffrey W Stuart, Henrik Danielsson, Staffan Bram, Mikael Lönebrink, Torbjörn Falkmer		Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) are defined by criteria comprising impairments in social interaction and communication. Altered visual perception is one possible and often discussed cause of difficulties in social interaction and social communication. Recently, Ashwin et al. suggested that enhanced ability in local visual processing in ASC was due to superior visual acuity, but that study has been the subject of methodological criticism, placing the findings in doubt.
21882363	doi: 10.1002/aur.218	Genetically inbred Balb/c mice differ from outbred Swiss Webster mice on discrete measures of sociability: relevance to a genetic mouse model of autism spectrum disorders.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	Luis F Jacome, Jessica A Burket, Amy L Herndon, Stephen I Deutsch		"The Balb/c mouse is proposed as a model of human disorders with prominent deficits of sociability, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) that may involve pathophysiological disruption of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission. A standard procedure was used to measure sociability in 8-week-old male genetically inbred Balb/c and outbred Swiss Webster mice. Moreover, because impaired sociability may influence the social behavior of stimulus mice, we also measured the proportion of total episodes of social approach made by the stimulus mouse while test and stimulus mice were allowed to interact freely. Three raters with good inter-rater agreement evaluated operationally defined measures of sociability chosen because of their descriptive similarity to deficits of social behavior reported in persons with ASDs. The data support previous reports that the Balb/c mouse is a genetic mouse model of impaired sociability. The data also show that the behavior of the social stimulus mouse is influenced by the impaired sociability of the Balb/c strain. Interestingly, operationally defined measures of sociability did not necessarily correlate with each other within mouse strain and the profile of correlated measures differed between strains. Finally, ""stereotypic"" behaviors (i.e. rearing, grooming and wall climbing) recorded during the session of free interaction between the test and social stimulus mice were more intensely displayed by Swiss Webster than Balb/c mice, suggesting that the domains of sociability and ""restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior"" are independent of each other in the Balb/c strain."
21882310	doi: 10.1002/aur.210	Impairments in multisensory processing are not universal to the autism spectrum: no evidence for crossmodal priming deficits in Asperger syndrome.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	Nicole David, Till R Schneider, Kai Vogeley, Andreas K Engel		"Individuals suffering from autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often show a tendency for detail- or feature-based perception (also referred to as ""local processing bias"") instead of more holistic stimulus processing typical for unaffected people. This local processing bias has been demonstrated for the visual and auditory domains and there is evidence that multisensory processing may also be affected in ASD. Most multisensory processing paradigms used social-communicative stimuli, such as human speech or faces, probing the processing of simultaneously occuring sensory signals. Multisensory processing, however, is not limited to simultaneous stimulation. In this study, we investigated whether multisensory processing deficits in ASD persist when semantically complex but nonsocial stimuli are presented in succession. Fifteen adult individuals with Asperger syndrome and 15 control persons participated in a visual-audio priming task, which required the classification of sounds that were either primed by semantically congruent or incongruent preceding pictures of objects. As expected, performance on congruent trials was faster and more accurate compared with incongruent trials (crossmodal priming effect). The Asperger group, however, did not differ significantly from the control group. Our results do not support a general multisensory processing deficit, which is universal to the entire autism spectrum."

21831593	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.07.034	Confirmatory factor analysis of the Adult Asperger Assessment: the association of symptom domains within a clinical population.	Research in developmental disabilities	2011	Renate Kuenssberg, Karen McKenzie		Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a behaviourally defined disorder characterised by impairments in three domains of social interaction, communication, and repetitive, stereotyped behaviours and activities. Proposed changes to diagnostic criteria suggest that the diagnostic triad may no longer fit as the best way to conceptualise ASD, and that social and communication impairments should be considered as a single domain. The aim of this study was to examine the structure of symptom domains within the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA; Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Robinson, & Woodbury-Smith, 2005), a diagnostic tool for high functioning adults. As theoretical models already exist, confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine data from a clinical population of adults (n = 153) diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and High Functioning Autism (HFA). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to fit different models based on the structure proposed by the authors of the AAA, the traditional triad and the newly proposed diagnostic dyad. Analysis suggested that none of the tested models were a good fit on the AAA dataset. However, it did highlight very high correlations between social and communication factors (r > 0.9) within unmodified models. The results of the analysis provide tentative support for the move towards considering ASD as a dyad of 'social-communication' impairments and repetitive/restricted interests behaviours and activities, rather than the traditional triad.

Part A	2011	Fabio Rueda Faucz, Josiane Souza, Aguinaldo Bonalumi Filho, Vanessa Santos Sotomaior, Egon Frantz, Sergio Antoniuk, Jill A Rosenfeld, Salmo Raskin		In the neurodevelopmentally impaired population the frequency of small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) is about 0.3%. To find the origin of a sSMC in a 4-year-old boy with Asperger syndrome (AS) a microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), using a 135K-feature whole-genome microarray, and Metaphase FISH analysis, was performed. The sSMC was characterized as being composed of 18.4 Mb from 19p12q13.11. Based on the size and genic content, it is expected that the partial trisomy detected is responsible for the characteristics observed in the patient. In that case it could be an indication of a novel locus associated with AS.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2012	Shilpi Sharma, Lisa Marks Woolfson, Simon C Hunter		This paper presents a review of past and current research on the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (AS) in children. It is suggested that the widely used criteria for diagnosing AS in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV are insufficient and invalid for a reliable diagnosis of AS. In addition, when these diagnostic criteria are applied, there is the potential bias of receiving a diagnosis towards the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Through a critical review of 69 research studies carried out between 1981 and 2010, this paper shows that six possible criteria for diagnosing AS (specifically, the age at which signs and symptoms related to autism become apparent, language and social communication abilities, intellectual abilities, motor or movement skills, repetitive patterns of behaviour and the nature of social interaction) overlap with the criteria for diagnosing autism. However, there is a possibility that some finer differences exist in the nature of social interaction, motor skills and speech patterns between groups with a diagnosis of AS and autism. These findings are proposed to be of relevance for designing intervention studies aimed at the treatment of specific symptoms in people with an autism spectrum disorder.

21767931	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.06.013	Motor ability and weight status are determinants of out-of-school activity participation for children with developmental coordination disorder.	Research in developmental disabilities	2011	Shirley S M Fong, Velma Y L Lee, Nerita N C Chan, Rachel S H Chan, Wai-Kwong Chak, Marco Y C Pang		According to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health model endorsed by the World Health Organization, participation in everyday activities is integral to normal child development. However, little is known about the influence of motor ability and weight status on physical activity participation in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD). This study aimed to (1) compare motor performance, weight status and pattern of out-of-school activity participation between children with DCD and those without; and (2) identify whether motor ability and weight status were determinants of participation patterns among children with DCD. We enrolled 81 children with DCD (boys, n = 63; girls, n = 18; mean age, 8.07 ± 1.5 years) and 67 typically developing children (boys, n = 48; girls, n = 19; mean age, 8.25 ± 1.6 years). Participation patterns (diversity, intensity, companionship, location, and enjoyment) were evaluated with the Children Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment. Motor ability was evaluated with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children, second edition (MABC-2). Other factors that may influence participation such as age, gender, and body weight were also recorded. Analysis of variance was used to compare outcome variables of the two groups, and significant determinants of activity participation were identified by multiple regression analysis. Children with DCD participated in fewer activities (i.e., limited participation diversity) and participated less frequently (i.e., limited participation intensity) than their typically developing peers; however, companionship, location of participation, and enjoyment level did not differ between the two groups. Children in the DCD group demonstrated significantly worse motor ability as assessed by the MABC-2. Further, a greater proportion of children in the DCD group were in the overweight/obese category compared with their typically developing peers. After accounting for the effects of age and gender, motor ability and weight category explained 7.6% and 5.0% of the variance in participation diversity, respectively, for children with DCD. Children with DCD showed less diverse and less intense out-of-school activity participation than typically developing children. Motor impairment and weight status were independently associated with the lower participation diversity. Interventions aiming at improving participation for children with DCD should target weight control and training in motor proficiency. Further study is needed to identify other factors that may hinder participation in this group of children.
21767929	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2011.06.018	The association between the social and communication elements of autism, and repetitive/restrictive behaviours and activities: a review of the literature.	Research in developmental disabilities	2011	Renate Kuenssberg, Karen McKenzie, Jill Jones		Research continues to try and pinpoint the etiological role of particular genes and brain structure in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), but despite a host of biological, genetic and neuropsychological research, the symptom profile of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are not yet linked to etiological theory. Debate continues around whether or not there is one single dimension that incorporates the three criteria domains of social difficulties, communication deficits and repetitive or restrictive interests and behaviours as a unitary 'ASD' concept, or whether PDD as they are currently described represent the co-occurrence of separate sub-domains of developmental difficulties. Although the three criteria need to be met for a diagnosis of PDD to be made, the association between them remains unclear. This review highlights that the majority of the literature that looks at the triad of impairments suggests the symptom structure does not match that proposed by diagnostic manuals, and that the triad may no longer fit as the best way to conceptualize ASD.

Health care for women international	2011	Jessica Gill, Pranee Liamputtong		In this article, we explore the experience of stigma amongst mothers of children who have Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Fifteen women participated in in-depth interviews; six produced a solicited diary that offered a more in-depth insight into the experiences of stigma amongst these mothers. We employed thematic analysis to analyze the data. We found that mothers perceived themselves to be stigmatized specifically in the school and community environments. Participants also compared their own experiences of stigma with other families with physically disabled children. Several strategies were established by these mothers in order to allow them to deal with this stigma better.
21745661	doi: 10.1016/j.cognition.2011.06.004	Moral judgment in adults with autism spectrum disorders.	Cognition	2011	Tiziana Zalla, Luca Barlassina, Marine Buon, Marion Leboyer		The ability of a group of adults with high functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger Syndrome (AS) to distinguish moral, conventional and disgust transgressions was investigated using a set of six transgression scenarios, each of which was followed by questions about permissibility, seriousness, authority contingency and justification. The results showed that although individuals with HFA or AS (HFA/AS) were able to distinguish affect-backed norms from conventional affect-neutral norms along the dimensions of permissibility, seriousness and authority-dependence, they failed to distinguish moral and disgust transgressions along the seriousness dimension and were unable to provide appropriate welfare-based moral justifications. Moreover, they judged conventional and disgust transgressions to be more serious than did the comparison group, and the correlation analysis revealed that the seriousness rating was related to their ToM impairment. We concluded that difficulties providing appropriate moral justifications and evaluating the seriousness of transgressions in individuals with HFA/AS may be explained by an impaired cognitive appraisal system that, while responsive to rule violations, fails to use relevant information about the agent's intentions and the affective impact of the action outcome in conscious moral reasoning.

Bratislavske lekarske listy	2011	P Krajmer, M Spajdel, A Kubranska, D Ostatnikova		"Previous studies have revealed that autism may arise as the result of exposure to high concentrations of prenatal testosterone. Ratio of second and fourth digits (2D:4D) is usually used as a proxy for prenatal testosterone. In this study, 2D:4D in 56 boys with ASD and in 32 control boys was measured. We found that the 2D:4D in ASD boys were lower than the ratio in control boys. These findings are discussed with reference to the ""extreme male-brain"" theory of autism. Results achieved in this interdisciplinary research are valuable in further biological and psychological approaches in neurocognitive research and diagnostics of children from ASD (Tab. 1, Ref. 38)."
21740749		Regional cerebral blood flow in children with autism spectrum disorders: a quantitative ⁹⁹mTc-ECD brain SPECT study with statistical parametric mapping evaluation.	Chinese medical journal	2011	Wen-Han Yang, Jin Jing, Li-Juan Xiu, Mu-Hua Cheng, Xin Wang, Peng Bao, Qing-Xiong Wang		Autism spectrum disorders (ASD), which include autism, asperger syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), are devastating neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood resulting in deficits in social interaction, repetitive patterns of behaviors, and restricted interests and activities. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a common technique used to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Several studies have measured rCBF in children with ASD using SPECT, however, findings are discordant. In addition, the majority of subjects used in these studies were autistic. In this study, we aimed to investigate changes in rCBF in children with ASD using SPECT.
21707353	doi: 10.1080/19371918.2011.579499	Autism and the African American community.	Social work in public health	2011	Ruby M Gourdine, Tiffany D Baffour, Martell Teasley		It is estimated that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect 1 in 500 live births per year. However, due to varying techniques for diagnosis and treatment, the disability remains the subject of debate. African Americans tend to suffer disproportionate rates of disability and disease when compared to other racial and ethnic groups due to access to preventative and curative care. However, evidence demonstrates that although rates of diagnosis for autism occur at the same rates in all racial groups, diagnosis in African American children occurs later than in White children. As a result, African American children may require longer and more intensive intervention. This article examines the etiology of autism, diagnosis, and treatment strategies and its impact on African American families. A case method approach is utilized to describe the impact of autism on an African American family. Implications for future research and professional practice and policy are discussed. Understanding autism is important as it relates to the human genome.
21697193	doi: 10.1177/1362361310387803	An investigation into social information processing in young people with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Andrea Mary Flood, Dougal Julian Hare, Paul Wallis		Deficits in social functioning are a core feature of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), being linked to various cognitive and developmental factors, but there has been little attempt to draw on normative models of social cognition to understand social behaviour in ASD. The current study explored the utility of Crick and Dodge's (1994) information processing model to studying social cognition in ASD, and examined associations between social information processing patterns, theory of mind skills and social functioning. A matched-group design compared young people with Asperger syndrome with typically developing peers, using a social information processing interview previously designed for this purpose. The Asperger syndrome group showed significantly different patterns of information processing at the intent attribution, response generation and response evaluation stages of the information processing model. Theory of mind skills were found to be significantly associated with parental ratings of peer problems in the Asperger syndrome group but not with parental ratings of pro-social behaviour, with only limited evidence of an association between social information processing and measures of theory of mind and social functioning. Overall, the study supports the use of normative social information processing approaches to understanding social functioning in ASD.
21695147	pii: e20835	A behavioral comparison of male and female adults with high functioning autism spectrum conditions.	PloS one	2011			Autism spectrum conditions (ASC) affect more males than females in the general population. However, within ASC it is unclear if there are phenotypic sex differences. Testing for similarities and differences between the sexes is important not only for clinical assessment but also has implications for theories of typical sex differences and of autism. Using cognitive and behavioral measures, we investigated similarities and differences between the sexes in age- and IQ-matched adults with ASC (high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome). Of the 83 (45 males and 38 females) participants, 62 (33 males and 29 females) met Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) cut-off criteria for autism in childhood and were included in all subsequent analyses. The severity of childhood core autism symptoms did not differ between the sexes. Males and females also did not differ in self-reported empathy, systemizing, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive traits/symptoms or mentalizing performance. However, adult females with ASC showed more lifetime sensory symptoms (p = 0.036), fewer current socio-communication difficulties (p = 0.001), and more self-reported autistic traits (p = 0.012) than males. In addition, females with ASC who also had developmental language delay had lower current performance IQ than those without developmental language delay (p<0.001), a pattern not seen in males. The absence of typical sex differences in empathizing-systemizing profiles within the autism spectrum confirms a prediction from the extreme male brain theory. Behavioral sex differences within ASC may also reflect different developmental mechanisms between males and females with ASC. We discuss the importance of the superficially better socio-communication ability in adult females with ASC in terms of why females with ASC may more often go under-recognized, and receive their diagnosis later, than males.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Sophieke Koolen, Constance Th W M Vissers, Angelique W C J Hendriks, Jos I M Egger, Ludo Verhoeven		This study examined the hypothesis of an atypical interaction between attention and language in ASD. A dual-task experiment with three conditions was designed, in which sentences were presented that contained errors requiring attentional focus either at (a) low level, or (b) high level, or (c) both levels of language. Speed and accuracy for error detection were measured from 16 high-functioning adults with ASD, and 16 matched controls. For controls, there was an attentional cost of dual level processing for low level performance but not for high level performance. For participants with ASD, there was an attentional cost both for low level and for high level performance. These results suggest a compensatory strategic use of attention during language processing in ASD.
21690084	doi: 10.1177/1362361310397217	A comparison of the trait emotional intelligence profiles of individuals with and without Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Kv Petrides, Kristelle Hudry, Georgia Michalaria, Viren Swami, Nick Sevdalis		The extent to which the socioemotional impairments of Asperger syndrome (AS) might be extreme manifestations of individual differences within the general population remains under-explored. We compared the trait emotional intelligence (trait EI) profiles of 30 individuals with AS against the profiles of 43 group-matched controls using the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). Participants with AS scored significantly lower than controls on 12 of the 15 TEIQue facets (η(p) (2) = 0.09 to 0.49) as well as on all four factors and the global score of the construct (η(p) (2) = 0.07 to 0.41). There was a significant main effect of gender, with men generally scoring higher than women. Results are discussed from the perspective of trait EI theory, with emphasis on its implications for the socioemotional impairments associated with AS.
21686145		Can tactile sensory processing differentiate between children with autistic disorder and asperger's disorder?	Innovations in clinical neuroscience	2011	Ahmad Ghanizadeh	Department of Psychiatry, Research Center for Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Hafez Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. ghanizad@sina.tums.ac.ir	There are debates whether autistic disorder (autism) and Asperger's disorder are two distinct disorders. Moreover, interventional sensory occupational therapy should consider the clinical characteristics of patients. Already, commonalities and differences between Asperger's disorder and autistic disorder are not well studied. The aim of this study is to compare tactile sensory function of children with autistic disorder and children with Asperger's disorder.
21683912	doi: 10.1016/j.chc.2011.03.004	Cornered: an approach to school bullying and cyberbullying, and forensic implications.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2011	Jeff Q Bostic, Colby C Brunt		Bullying is an abuse of power and control that can cause significant harm to individuals. School systems have the difficult task of trying to police this behavior to maintain a safe learning environment for their students. Although there may be an identified bully, the ramifications of the behavior affect the system as a whole. Bullies, targeted victims, and bystanders play an integral role in ameliorating this problem. A change of culture within the school system is often the best, yet often the most difficult, intervention. In addition, cyberbullying has become a powerful avenue for bullying, resulting in significant morbidity within schools.
21676037	doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2011.07726.x	Brain stimulation over Broca's area differentially modulates naming skills in neurotypical adults and individuals with Asperger's syndrome.	The European journal of neuroscience	2011	Shirley Fecteau, Sara Agosta, Lindsay Oberman, Alvaro Pascual-Leone		In the present study we tested the hypothesis that, in subjects with Asperger's syndrome (ASP), the dynamics of language-related regions might be abnormal, so that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over Broca's area leads to differential behavioral effects as seen in neurotypical controls. We conducted a five-stimulation-site, double-blind, multiple crossover, pseudo-randomized, sham-controlled study in 10 individuals with ASP and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects. Object naming was assessed before and after low-frequency rTMS of the left pars opercularis, left pars triangularis, right pars opercularis and right pars triangularis, and sham stimulation, as guided stereotaxically by each individual's brain magnetic resonance imaging. In ASP participants, naming improved after rTMS of the left pars triangularis as compared with sham stimulation, whereas rTMS of the adjacent left opercularis lengthened naming latency. In healthy subjects, stimulation of parts of Broca's area did not lead to significant changes in naming skills, consistent with published data. Overall, these findings support our hypothesis of abnormal language neural network dynamics in individuals with ASP. From a methodological point of view, this work illustrates the use of rTMS to study the dynamics of brain-behavior relations by revealing the differential behavioral impact of non-invasive brain stimulation in a neuropsychiatric disorder.
21669013	doi: 10.1017/S0305000911000043	Individual differences in pronoun reversal: evidence from two longitudinal case studies.	Journal of child language	2012	Karen E Evans, Katherine Demuth		Pronoun reversal, the use of you for self-reference and I for an addressee, has often been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and impaired language. However, recent case studies have shown the phenomenon also to occur in typically developing and even precocious talkers. This study examines longitudinal corpus data from two children, a typically developing girl, and a boy with Asperger's syndrome. Both were precocious talkers who reversed the majority of their personal pronouns for several months. A comparison of the children's behaviors revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in pronoun use: the girl showed 'semantic confusion', using second person pronouns for self-reference, whereas the boy showed a discourse-pragmatic deficit related to perspective-taking. The results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying pronoun reversal and provide qualified support for both the Name/Person Hypothesis (Clark, 1978; Charney, 1980b) and the Plurifunctional Pronoun Hypothesis (Chiat, 1982).

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Lawrence Scahill, James T McCracken, Karen Bearss, Fay Robinson, Eric Hollander, Bryan King, Joel Bregman, Lin Sikich, Kimberly Dukes, Lisa Sullivan, Evdokia Anagnostou, Craig Donnelly, Young-Shin Kim, Louise Ritz, Deborah Hirtz, Ann Wagner		The Studies to Advance Autism Research and Treatment Network conducted a randomized trial with citalopram in children with Pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). We present the rationale, design and sample characteristics of the citalopram trial. Subjects (128 boys, 21 girls) had a mean age of 9.3 (±3.12) years; 132 (88.6%) were diagnosed with autistic disorder (4.7% with Asperger's Disorder; 6.7% with PDD-not otherwise specified). Less than half of the subjects were intellectually disabled; 117 (78.5%) were rated Moderate or Marked on the Clinical Global Impression for Severity. Study measures were similar to previous Research Units on Pediatric Psychopharmacology trials. Subjects in this trial were slightly older and more likely to have complaints of repetitive behavior than participants in RUPP trials.
21660499	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1299-5	Differentiation of high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder based on neuromotor behaviour.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Ashwini Nayate, Bruce J Tonge, John L Bradshaw, Jennifer L McGinley, Robert Iansek, Nicole J Rinehart		Autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) are characterised by impairments in social interaction, stereotypic behaviours or restricted interests. Although currently listed as distinct clinical disorders, the validity of their distinction remains controversial. This study examined gait in children with autism and AD. Eleven children with high-functioning autism and eleven children with AD completed a series of walking tasks. Results indicated distinct movement disturbance; these findings are discussed in light of seminal papers in this field by Vilensky et al. (Arch Neurol 38:646-649, 1981) and Hallett et al. (Arch Neurol 50:1304-1308, 1993) who interpret the gait of individuals with autism using parkinsonian and cerebellar-ataxia patient models, respectively. Distinctions in gait patterns implicating perhaps unique motor circuit disturbances support the hypothesis that autism and AD may have unique neurodevelopmental trajectories.
21660467	doi: 10.1007/s00221-011-2751-7	The effect of visual spatial attention on audiovisual speech perception in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Experimental brain research	2011	Satu Saalasti, Kaisa Tiippana, Jari Kätsyri, Mikko Sams		Individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) have problems in following conversation, especially in the situations where several people are talking. This might result from impairments in audiovisual speech perception, especially from difficulties in focusing attention to speech-relevant visual information and ignoring distracting information. We studied the effect of visual spatial attention on the audiovisual speech perception of adult individuals with AS and matched control participants. Two faces were presented side by side, one uttering /aka/ and the other /ata/, while an auditory stimulus of /apa/ was played. The participants fixated on a central cross and directed their attention to the face that an arrow pointed to, reporting which consonant they heard. We hypothesized that the adults with AS would be more distracted by a competing talking face than the controls. Instead, they were able to covertly attend to the talking face, and they were as distracted by a competing face as the controls. Independently of the attentional effect, there was a qualitative difference in audiovisual speech perception: when the visual articulation was /aka/, the control participants heard /aka/ almost exclusively, while the participants with AS heard frequently /ata/. This finding may relate to difficulties in face-to-face communication in AS.
21647793	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1296-8	Asperger through the looking glass: an exploratory study of self-understanding in people with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Paul Jackson, Paul Skirrow, Dougal Julian Hare		"Hobson (Autism and the development of mind. Lawrence Erlbaum, Hove, UK 1993) has proposed that the cognitive and linguistic disabilities that characterise autism result from abnormalities in inter-subjective engagement during infancy, which in turn results in impaired reflective self-awareness. The aim of the present study was to test Hobson's hypothesis by examining self-understanding in Asperger's syndrome (AS) using Damon and Hart's (Self-understanding in childhood and adolescence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988) model of self-concept. Ten participants with Asperger's syndrome were compared with ten non AS controls using the Self-understanding Interview (Damon and Hart in Self-understanding in Childhood and Adolescence. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1988). The study found that the Asperger's group demonstrated impairment in the ""self-as-object"" and ""self-as-subject"" domains of the Self-understanding Interview, which supported Hobson's concept of an impaired capacity for self-awareness and self-reflection in people with ASD. The results are discussed with reference to previous research regarding the development of self-understanding in people with ASD."
21643861	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1301-2	Atypical movement performance and sensory integration in Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Panagiotis Siaperas, Howard A Ring, Catherine J McAllister, Sheila Henderson, Anna Barnett, Peter Watson, Anthony J Holland		The aims of this study were to investigate whether individuals with AS have impaired motor abilities and sensorimotor processing and whether these impairments were age-related. Sensorimotor abilities were examined using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2, and the Sensory Integration Praxis Test. Fifty boys with AS aged 7-14 years old were compared with typically developing boys. Overall, children with AS showed significant impairment of movement performance as well as proprioceptive and vestibular processing. There were no interaction effects of age and clinical group on level of performance deficit in any of the modalities tested. Increasing our understanding of motor and sensory impairment in AS could have treatment implications for those supporting individuals with AS.
21626699	doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201100094	Discovery, structure-activity relationship studies, and crystal structure of nonpeptide inhibitors bound to the Shank3 PDZ domain.	ChemMedChem	2011	Jörn Saupe, Yvette Roske, Christian Schillinger, Nestor Kamdem, Silke Radetzki, Anne Diehl, Hartmut Oschkinat, Gerd Krause, Udo Heinemann, Jörg Rademann		Shank is the central scaffolding protein of the postsynaptic density (PSD) protein complex found in cells of the central nervous system. Cellular studies indicate a prominent role of the protein in the organization of the PSD, in the development of neuronal morphology, in neuronal signaling, and in synaptic plasticity, thus linking Shank functions to the molecular basis of learning and memory. Mutations in the Shank gene have been found in several neuronal disorders including mental retardation, typical autism, and Asperger syndrome. Shank is linked to the PSD complex via its PDZ domain that binds to the C-terminus of guanylate-kinase-associated protein (GKAP). Here, small-molecule inhibitors of Shank3 PDZ domain are developed. A fluorescence polarization assay based on an identified high-affinity peptide is established, and tetrahydroquinoline carboxylates are identified as inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction. Chemical synthesis via a hetero-Diels-Alder strategy is employed for hit optimization, and structure-activity relationship studies are performed. Best hits possess K(i) values in the 10 μM range, and binding to the PDZ domain is confirmed by ¹H,¹⁵N HSQC NMR experiments. One of the hits crystallizes with the Shank3 PDZ domain. The structure, analyzed at a resolution of 1.85 Å, reveals details of the binding mode. Finally, binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95, syntrophin, and DVL3 was studied using ¹H,¹⁵N HSQC NMR spectroscopy.

21610188	doi: 10.1177/1362361311405223	'I just don't fit anywhere': support experiences and future support needs of individuals with Asperger syndrome in middle adulthood.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2012	Gemma M Griffith, Vasiliki Totsika, Susie Nash, Richard P Hastings		The experiences of individuals in middle adulthood with Asperger syndrome have been the subject of little previous research, especially in terms of their experience of support services. In the present research, 11 adults with Asperger syndrome were interviewed. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to interpret the interviews. Four themes emerged from the analysis: living with Asperger syndrome; employment issues; experiences with mainstream support; and future steps towards supporting adults with Asperger syndrome. The findings highlighted the anxiety, depression, and communication difficulties that people with Asperger syndrome may experience. Much of the available support is perceived as unsuitable for individuals with Asperger syndrome. All participants wanted to remain as independent as possible, and believed an individualized approach to support would be greatly beneficial. Recommendations are made for future practice to help support adults with Asperger syndrome.
21610185	doi: 10.1177/1362361311407353	Perception of mirror symmetry in autism spectrum disorders.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2012	Christine M Falter, Anthony J Bailey		Gestalt grouping in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is selectively impaired for certain organization principles but for not others. Symmetry is a fundamental Gestalt principle characterizing many biological shapes. Sensitivity to symmetry was tested using the Picture Symmetry Test, which requires finding symmetry lines on pictures. Individuals with ASD showed decreased sensitivity to symmetry and a correlation of test performance with performance IQ. Decreased sensitivity for symmetry in ASD is discussed in relation to reduced visual experience of faces in early development.
21606694	doi: 10.1097/SMJ.0b013e31820c015d	Asperger disorder in adults.	Southern medical journal	2011	Manu Arora, Samir Kumar Praharaj, Sujit Sarkhel, Vinod Kumar Sinha		Asperger disorder was first described in 1944 by the Austrian pediatrician, Hans Asperger. It was introduced as a separate diagnostic category from autistic disorder in DSM-IV and ICD-10. The pattern of comorbidity in Asperger disorder is different from autistic disorder, with a higher level of psychosis, violent behavior, anxiety, and mood disorders. We present three cases of Asperger disorder diagnosed for the first time in adulthood, with psychosis being the predominant reason for the referral. In each case, the psychosis improved with antipsychotic treatment, although core autistic symptoms remained the same.

21591401		[A case of Asperger's disorder with catatonia originally suspected of being catatonic schizophrenia].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2011	Shinnosuke Saito, Kuniaki Yamaga, Toshiyuki Kobayashi, Satoshi Kato		We report the case of an adolescent male who presented with mutism, immobility, catalepsy, and mannerisms. The patient was admitted to our hospital with suspected catatonic schizophrenia; however, he was subsequently diagnosed with catatonia due to Asperger's disorder. The patient was a 16-year-old male. More than six months before presentation, his grandfather displayed bizarre and violent behavior. Subsequently, he began to experience catatonia, which eventually led to hospitalization. Treatment with diazepam improved his condition and, as no causal disorders other than Asperger's disorder were identified, he was diagnosed with catatonia. The patient had experienced persistent abuse by his mother during childhood; therefore, it is important to consider reactive attachment disorder (DSM-IV-TR) as a differential diagnosis. Among child and adolescent psychiatrists, catatonia is considered to occur at a high frequency among patients with autistic spectrum disorders. In contrast, general psychiatrists tend to consider catatonia as related to schizophrenia, which may be the reason why the diagnosis of our patient was difficult. We assume that the pathogenesis of catatonia in this case was death mimicry due to the subjective perception of a life-threatening situation. For the treatment of catatonia with autistic spectrum disorders, the efficacy of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy has been established. When a patient with an autistic spectrum disorder presents with motor functional disturbances, it is important to consider these disturbances as catatonia. Furthermore, it is also important to begin the treatment mentioned above even in the presence of definite psychogenic or situational factors.
21590432	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1283-0	Can gaze avoidance explain why individuals with Asperger's syndrome can't recognise emotions from facial expressions?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Alyssa C P Sawyer, Paul Williamson, Robyn L Young		Research has shown that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties recognising emotions from facial expressions. Since eye contact is important for accurate emotion recognition, and individuals with ASD tend to avoid eye contact, this tendency for gaze aversion has been proposed as an explanation for the emotion recognition deficit. This explanation was investigated using a newly developed emotion and mental state recognition task. Individuals with Asperger's Syndrome were less accurate at recognising emotions and mental states, but did not show evidence of gaze avoidance compared to individuals without Asperger's Syndrome. This suggests that the way individuals with Asperger's Syndrome look at faces cannot account for the difficulty they have recognising expressions.
21575668	doi: 10.1016/j.pnpbp.2011.04.010	Association study of the CNS patterning genes and autism in Han Chinese in Taiwan.	Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry	2011	Yi-Ling Chien, Yu-Yu Wu, Yen-Nan Chiu, Shih-Kai Liu, Wen-Che Tsai, Ping-I Lin, Chia-Hsiang Chen, Susan Shur-Fen Gau, Wei-Hsien Chien		Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with high heritability. Despite different approaches worldwide to identify susceptibility loci or genes for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), no consistent result has been reported. CNS patterning genes have been recognized as candidate genes for autism based on neuroimage and neuropathology evidence. This study investigated four candidate genes (WNT2, EN2, SHANK3, and FOXP2) by a tag SNP approach in a family-based association study. The trio samples include 1164 subjects from 393 families, including 393 probands (aged 9.1±4.0years; male, 88.6%) diagnosed with autistic disorder (n=373) or Asperger's disorder (n=20) according to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria and confirmed by the Chinese ADI-R interview. Three tag SNPs of EN2 (7q36), 6 SNPs of WNT2 (7q31-33), 5 SNPs of SHANK3 (22q13.3), 3 SNPs of FOXP2 (7q31) were genotyped. TDT analysis was done to test the association of each tag SNP and haplotype. There was no association with autism for 17 tag SNPs of WNT2, EN2, SHANK3, and FOXP2 based on SNP analyses. Haplotype analyses did not reveal significant association except for the 6 tag SNPs of WNT2 gene showing a significant association on one haplotype composed of rs2896218 and rs6950765 (G-G) (p=0.0095). Other haplotypes composed of rs2896218 and rs6950765 (G-G) were also significantly associated with autism. The present study indicates that SHANK3 may not be a critical gene for the etiology of ASDs in Han Chinese population. Inconsistent findings in EN2 and FOXP2 in the Han Chinese population need further clarification. A haplotype of WNT2 (rs2896218-rs6950765: G-G) is significantly associated with ASDs in our trios samples, this finding warrants further validation by different sample and confirmation by functional study.

In a previous study, a Finnish group demonstrated that DISC1 polymorphisms were associated with autism and Asperger syndrome. However, the results were not replicated in Korean population. To determine whether DISC1 is associated with autism in Chinese Han population, we performed a family-based association study between DISC1 polymorphisms and autism.

21547846	doi: 10.1080/13554794.2010.532135	The neural architecture of expert calendar calculation: a matter of strategy?	Neurocase	2011	Thorsten Fehr, Gregory L Wallace, Peter Erhard, Manfred Herrmann		Savants and prodigies are individuals with exceptional skills in particular mental domains. In the present study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural correlates of calendar calculation in two individuals, a savant with Asperger's disorder and a self-taught mathematical prodigy. If there is a modular neural organization of exceptional performance in a specific mental domain, calendar calculation should be reflected in a considerable overlap in the recruitment of brain circuits across expert individuals. However, considerable individual differences in activation patterns during calendar calculation were noted. The present results indicate that activation patterns produced by complex mental processing, such as calendar calculation, seem to be influenced strongly by learning history and idiosyncratic strategy usage rather than a modular neural organization. Thus, well-known individual differences in complex cognition play a major role even in experts with exceptional abilities in a particular mental domain and should in particular be considered when examining the neural architecture of complex mental processes and skills.

Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie	2011	F-G Lehnhardt, A Gawronski, K Volpert, L Schilbach, R Tepest, W Huff, K Vogeley		High-functioning autism (HFA) and Aspergers syndrome (AS) are autism spectrum disorders (ASD) characterised by disturbances in social interaction, both verbal and non-verbal communication and repetitive and/or restrictive behaviour since early childhood. Symptoms appear generally during early childhood and adolescence. The increasing need to clarify diagnostic queries in advanced age led to the constitution of specialised outpatient clinics for adults involving a growing amount of HFA/AS subjects diagnosed late in life. However, thus far neuropsychological data about this group are scarce.
21528391	doi: 10.1007/s00787-011-0177-1	Odor detection threshold, but not odor identification, is impaired in children with autism.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2011	Iva Dudova, Jan Vodicka, Marketa Havlovicova, Zdenek Sedlacek, Tomas Urbanek, Michal Hrdlicka		The aim of our study was to examine odor detection thresholds and odor identification in autistic subjects. Thirty-five patients with Asperger's syndrome and high functioning autism (mean age 10.8 ± 3.6 years; 31 boys) were compared with 35 healthy control subjects (mean age 10.4 ± 2.4 years; 28 boys). There were no significant differences between groups with regard to mean age (p = 0.598) and gender proportion (p = 0.324). Olfactory testing used the Sniffin' Sticks test (threshold and identification parts only). Participants with Asperger's syndrome and high functioning autism, in comparison with healthy controls, were significantly impaired relative to odor detection thresholds (6.3 ± 3.1 vs. 7.9 ± 2.0; p = 0.025). Autistic participants were significantly better in correctly identifying the odor of an orange (94 vs. 63%; p < 0.05) and significantly worse at correctly identifying the odor of cloves (40 vs. 74%; p < 0.05). With regard to identification of fourteen other substances, there were no significant differences. There was no significant difference between autistic and control subjects on the total score of olfactory identification (p = 0.799). Odor identification ability (as expressed by this total score) correlated significantly with age in the control group (p = 0.049), but not in the autism group (p = 0.103). We found impaired odor detection and almost normal odor identification in children with autism. Implications for further research are discussed.
21526585		Use of Gilliam Asperger's disorder scale in differentiating high and low functioning autism and ADHD.	Psychological reports	2011	Susan Dickerson Mayes, Susan L Calhoun, Michael J Murray, Jill D Morrow, Kirsten K L Yurich, Shiyoko Cothren, Heather Purichia, James N Bouder		Little is known about the validity of Gilliam Asperger's Disorder Scale (GADS), although it is widely used. This study of 199 children with high functioning autism or Asperger's disorder, 195 with low functioning autism, and 83 with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) showed high classification accuracy (autism vs. ADHD) for clinicians' GADS Quotients (92%), and somewhat lower accuracy (77%) for parents' Quotients. Both children with high and low functioning autism had clinicians' Quotients (M=99 and 101, respectively) similar to the Asperger's Disorder mean of 100 for the GADS normative sample. Children with high functioning autism scored significantly higher on the cognitive patterns subscale than children with low functioning autism, and the latter had higher scores on the remaining subscales: social interaction, restricted patterns of behavior, and pragmatic skills. Using the clinicians' Quotient and Cognitive Patterns score, 70% of children were correctly identified as having high or low functioning autism or ADHD.

Psychiatry investigation	2011	Masaru Tateno, Saya Kikuchi, Kumi Uehara, Kyoko Fukita, Naoki Uchida, Ryuji Sasaki, Toshikazu Saito		The concept of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) closely resemble each other. Both ICD-10 and DSM-IV use the term PDD. The authors surveyed the perception of PDD/ASD and attitudes toward terminology. The subjects of this study were 205 medical/social-welfare professionals working in fields relating to developmental disorders. Questionnaires were mailed to site investigators at the collaborating institutes. With regard to what the scope of ASD and PDD encompasses, the answers were almost equally divided among three views: ASD and PDD are the same, PDD is wider in scope and ASD is wider. The terms PDD and autism were used in slightly different ways depended upon the situation. Our results demonstrate that the parameters of PDD and ASD are unclear and that the terms related to PDD/ASD are often used differently. Further studies are required to develop more clear and reliable diagnostic criteria for PDD.

21516432	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1259-0	Brief report: life history and neuropathology of a gifted man with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Karen M Weidenheim, Alfonso Escobar, Isabelle Rapin		Despite recent interest in the pathogenesis of the autism spectrum disorders (pervasive developmental disorders), neuropathological descriptions of brains of individuals with well documented clinical information and without potentially confounding symptomatology are exceptionally rare. Asperger syndrome differs from classic autism by lack of cognitive impairment or delay in expressive language acquisition. We examined the 1,570 g brain of a 63 year old otherwise healthy mathematician with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder of Asperger subtype. Except for an atypical gyral pattern and megalencephaly, we detected no specific neuropathologic abnormality. Taken together, the behavioral data and pathological findings in this case are compatible with an early neurodevelopmental process affecting multiple neuroanatomic networks, but without a convincing morphologic signature detectable with routine neuropathologic technology.

Research in developmental disabilities	2011	Tove Lugnegård, Maria Unenge Hallerbäck, Christopher Gillberg		In children with autism spectrum disorders, previous studies have shown high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. To date, studies on adults have been scarce. The aim of the present study was to investigate psychiatric comorbidity in young adults with Asperger syndrome. Participants were 26 men and 28 women (mean age 27 years) with a clinical diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. IQ was measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition. Autism spectrum diagnoses were confirmed using the DIagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders. In our study group, 70% had experienced at least one episode of major depression, and 50% had suffered from recurrent depressive episodes. Anxiety disorders were seen in about 50%. Psychotic disorders and substance-induced disorders were uncommon. In conclusion, young adults with autism spectrum disorders are at high risk for mood and anxiety disorders. To identify these conditions and offer treatment, elevated vigilance is needed in clinical practice.
21503798	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1246-5	Brief report: making experience personal: internal states language in the memory narratives of children with and without Asperger's disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Benjamin T Brown, Gwynn Morris, Robert E Nida, Lynne Baker-Ward		The development of the personal past is complex, requiring the operation of multiple components of cognitive and social functioning. Because many of these components are affected by autism spectrum disorders, it is likely that autobiographical memory in children with Asperger's Disorder (AD) will be impaired. We predicted that the memory narratives of children with AD, in comparison to typically-developing peers, would reflect less personal interpretation as evidenced by internal states language. Thirty children with AD and 20 typically-developing children aged 6-14 reported their earliest memories and two emotional experiences (one positive and one negative). Consistent with our predictions, children with AD included fewer emotional, cognitive, and perceptual terms than the comparison sample.
21503797	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1249-2	Social competence intervention for elementary students with Aspergers syndrome and high functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Janine P Stichter, Karen V O'Connor, Melissa J Herzog, Kristin Lierheimer, Stephanie D McGhee		Despite frequent reports of academic success, individuals with high functioning autism or Aspergers Syndrome (HFA/AS) often manifest deficits in social abilities. These deficits can lead to daily difficulties, and negative long-term outcomes. Deficits in social competency are evident in this population from an early age, as children with HFA/AS present unique challenges relating to peers, interpreting complex contextual cues, and transitioning across settings. A paucity of social interventions exist that target elementary-age children with HFA/AS and their combination of core social competence deficit areas: theory of mind (ToM), emotional recognition, and executive functioning. The current study expanded on the Social Competence Intervention (for adolescents; SCI-A), as detailed in Stichter et al. (J Autism Dev Disorders 40:1067-1079, 2010), by adjusting the curriculum to meet the needs of an elementary population. Results indicate significant improvements on direct assessments measuring theory of mind and problem solving, and parent perceptions of overall social abilities and executive functioning for 20 students, aged 6-10, with HFA/AS. The elementary SCI program appears promising, however, additional replications are necessary including expansion to school settings.

Molecular psychiatry	2012	E Schwarz, P C Guest, H Rahmoune, L W Harris, L Wang, F M Leweke, M Rothermundt, B Bogerts, D Koethe, L Kranaster, P Ohrmann, T Suslow, G McAllister, M Spain, A Barnes, N J M van Beveren, S Baron-Cohen, J Steiner, F E Torrey, R H Yolken, S Bahn		Biomarkers are now used in many areas of medicine but are still lacking for psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia (SCZ). We have used a multiplex molecular profiling approach to measure serum concentrations of 181 proteins and small molecules in 250 first and recent onset SCZ, 35 major depressive disorder (MDD), 32 euthymic bipolar disorder (BPD), 45 Asperger syndrome and 280 control subjects. Preliminary analysis resulted in identification of a signature comprised of 34 analytes in a cohort of closely matched SCZ (n=71) and control (n=59) subjects. Partial least squares discriminant analysis using this signature gave a separation of 60-75% of SCZ subjects from controls across five independent cohorts. The same analysis also gave a separation of ~50% of MDD patients and 10-20% of BPD and Asperger syndrome subjects from controls. These results demonstrate for the first time that a biological signature for SCZ can be identified in blood serum. This study lays the groundwork for development of a diagnostic test that can be used as an aid for distinguishing SCZ subjects from healthy controls and from those affected by related psychiatric illnesses with overlapping symptoms.

American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics	2011	Holly N Cukier, Daria Salyakina, Sarah F Blankstein, Joycelyn L Robinson, Stephanie Sacharow, Deqiong Ma, Harry H Wright, Ruth K Abramson, Ramkumar Menon, Scott M Williams, Jonathan L Haines, Michael L Cuccaro, John R Gilbert, Margaret A Pericak-Vance		Copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in the intricate genetics of autism spectrum disorders. A region on chromosome 15q24 vulnerable to both deletions and duplications has been previously implicated in a range of phenotypes including autism, Asperger's syndrome, delayed development, and mild to severe mental retardation. Prior studies have delineated a minimal critical region of approximately 1.33 Mb. In this study, a multiplex autism family was evaluated for CNVs using genotyping data from the Illumina 1 M BeadChip and analyzed with the PennCNV algorithm. Variants were then identified that co-segregate with autism features in this family. Here, we report autistic first cousins who carry two microduplications concordant with disease. Both duplications were inherited maternally and found to be identical by descent. The first is an approximately 10,000 base pair microduplication within the minimal region on 15q24 that falls across a single gene, ubiquitin-like 7. This is the smallest duplication in the region to result in a neuropsychiatric disorder, potentially narrowing the critical region for susceptibility to developmental and autism spectrum disorders. The second is a novel, 352 kb tandem duplication on 7p21 that replicates part of the neurexophilin 1 and islet cell autoantigen 1 genes. The breakpoint junction falls within the intronic regions of these genes and demonstrates a microhomology of four base pairs. Each of these microduplications may contribute to the complex etiology of autism spectrum disorders.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Luisa Ruiz Calzada, Nancy Pistrang, William P L Mandy		We used framework analysis to investigate the utility of pervasive developmental disorder diagnoses, interviewing young people (aged 9-16 years) with high-functioning autistic disorder (AD) and Asperger's disorder (AsD), and their parents. Twenty two participants from ten families described both gains and costs resulting from diagnosis. Perceived advantages of AD and AsD diagnosis were increased understanding and practical support, and parental empowerment. Disadvantages included the effects of stigma and concerns about validity. Participants tended to consider AsD and AD as interchangeable terms. Findings suggest that the utility of AD and AsD depends upon both their validity and how these diagnoses are received in their cultural, economic and legislative context. Improvement of post-diagnostic services will improve the utility of AD and AsD.

Archives of general psychiatry	2011	Esther Via, Joaquim Radua, Narcis Cardoner, Francesca Happé, David Mataix-Cols		Studies investigating abnormalities of regional gray matter volume in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yielded contradictory results. It is unclear whether the current subtyping of ASD into autistic disorder and Asperger disorder is neurobiologically valid.

First described in 1944 by Hans Asperger, Asperger syndrome (AS) is now considered in international diagnostic classifications as one of the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The main symptoms of AS are severe impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests, without significant delay in cognitive and language development. Its prevalence is not clearly established but might be around 0.26 per 1000. Symptoms of high-functioning autism (HFA), which is not an official diagnostic category, are quite similar. Children and adolescents with AS or HFA mostly have a social skills deficit, in connection with a lack of understanding concerning the rules governing social interactions. This deficit often leads to social isolation and peer rejection, which can alter their quality of life. Their lack of social skills can also have effects on success at school or work, integration among peers and mental health. According to recent guidelines of the French national authority for health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) about the special needs of persons with PDD, professionals have to develop evidence-based interventions, emphasizing social interactions and participation, as described by the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF): social and professional participation as well as participation in leisure activities, clubs and societies, etc.
21455795	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1219-8	Estimation of the intelligence quotient using Wechsler Intelligence Scales in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Jessica Merchán-Naranjo, María Mayoral, Marta Rapado-Castro, Cloe Llorente, Leticia Boada, Celso Arango, Mara Parellada		Asperger syndrome (AS) patients show heterogeneous intelligence profiles and the validity of short forms for estimating intelligence has rarely been studied in this population. We analyzed the validity of Wechsler Intelligence Scale (WIS) short forms for estimating full-scale intelligence quotient (FSIQ) and assessing intelligence profiles in 29 AS patients. Only the Information and Block Design dyad meets the study criteria. No statistically significant differences were found between dyad scores and FSIQ scores (t(28) = 1.757; p = 0.09). The dyad has a high correlation with FSIQ, good percentage of variance explained (R(2) = 0.591; p < 0.001), and high consistency with the FSIQ classification (χ(2)(36) = 45.202; p = 0.14). Short forms with good predictive accuracy may not be accurate in clinical groups with atypical cognitive profiles such as AS patients.
21452506		[Asperger's syndrome in family context--review of studies].	Psychiatria polska	2010	Anna Zmijewska	Uniwersytet Warszawski, Wydział Psychologii, Katedra Psychologii Rehabilitacji.	In recent years in the face of still growing number of diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders there has been an increase in number of research in the functioning of family of children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome. Studies concerning families of children with autism have been predominantly occupied with the stress-coping strategies and also with the therapeutic effect of interaction between disabled children and the rest of the family. New studies with families of children with Asperger's Syndrome, apart from the coping styles of parents and the received support, are also examining the properties of the system of these families, like: cohesion, adaptability, organisation, control, expressiveness or conflict. Such a perspective enables researchers to describe the circularity of influences in these families, on the other hand, however, some methodological deficiencies of this research, as well as the lack of longitudinal studies prevent researchers from creating a comprehensive picture of functioning of these families.
21452096	doi: 10.1080/1357650X.2010.513385	Strength of lateralisation for processing facial emotion in relation to autistic traits in individuals without autism.	Laterality	2012	Matei Vladeanu, Ewa M Monteith-Hodge, Victoria J Bourne		A great number of studies have shown that non-clinical individuals rely predominantly on the right hemisphere to process facial emotion. Previous studies have shown that males suffering from Asperger's syndrome show a typical right hemisphere bias for processing facial emotion (happiness and sadness) but a reduced right hemisphere bias for processing facial identity. This study looks at the lateralisation of all six basic emotions using the chimeric faces test in 64 non-clinical participants (32 males, 32 females) and correlates it with their autistic traits measured using the Broad Autistic Phenotype Questionnaire. For males only, regression analyses showed a relationship between the aloof personality trait and lateralisation for fear, happiness, and surprise. Males with high autistic scores on the aloof personality subscale (showing a lack of interest in social interaction) were more strongly lateralised to the right hemisphere for processing fear, happiness, and surprise. For males there was no relationship with anger, disgust, sadness, or non-facial stimuli, and for females there were no significant relationships at all. The autistic traits of rigidity and pragmatic language were not significant predictors of emotion lateralisation. The over-reliance on the right hemisphere for processing facial emotion in males seems to support the idea that the autistic brain could be seen as hyper-masculinised, possibly due to prenatal testosterone exposure.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2012	Rebecca M Jones, Sally Wheelwright, Krista Farrell, Emma Martin, Richard Green, Domenico Di Ceglie, Simon Baron-Cohen		The 'extreme male brain' theory suggests females with Autism Spectrum Conditions are hyper-masculinized in certain aspects of behavior. We predicted that females with Gender Identity Disorder (who are masculinized) would have elevated Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores. AQ scores from five groups were compared: (1) n = 61 transmen (female-to-male transsexual people); (2) n = 198 transwomen (male-to-female transsexual people); (3) n = 76 typical males; (4) n = 98 typical females; and (5) n = 125 individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS). Transmen had a higher mean AQ than typical females, typical males and transwomen, but lower than individuals with AS. Transmen have more autistic traits and may have had difficulty socializing with female peers and thus found it easier to identify with male peer groups.

Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja	2011	Janne Sihvonen	Keski-Satakunnan terveydenhuollon kuntayhtyma, Koulukatu 2, Harjavalta.	Asperger syndrome is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition. The major features of the syndrome include problems in social interaction and communication, narrow interests and stereotyped behaviour. Cognitive abilities are usually within normal. The syndrome potentially leads to a diminished level of life management in adulthood. Neuropsychiatric coaching is a solution-focused and practically oriented process of interventions for clients with neurodevelopmental problems. The methods include forms of evaluation and self reflection, structuring, guidance and visualization aids. Coaching does not exclude simultaneous therapeutic elements. The effectiveness has not yet been established by research, but the experiences reported have been encouraging. Neuropsychiatric coaching is recommended for adults with Asperger syndrome to rehabilitate life management skills.

The present study assesses affective components of empathy via both self-report and parental report.
21430018	doi: 10.1177/1362361310365070	Social vulnerability and bullying in children with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Kate Sofronoff, Elizabeth Dark, Valerie Stone		Children with Asperger syndrome (AS) have IQ within the normal range but specific impairments in theory of mind, social interaction and communication skills. The majority receive education in mainstream schools and research suggests they are bullied more than typically developing peers. The current study aimed to evaluate factors that predict bullying for such children and also to examine a new measure, the Social Vulnerability Scale (SVS). One hundred and thirty three parents of children with AS completed the SVS and of these 92 parents completed both the SVS and questionnaires measuring anxiety, anger, behaviour problems, social skills and bullying. Regression analyses revealed that these variables together strongly predicted bullying, but that social vulnerability was the strongest predictor. Test-re-test and internal consistency analyses of the SVS demonstrated sound psychometric properties and factor analyses revealed two sub-scales: gullibility and credulity. Limitations of the study are acknowledged and suggestions for future research discussed.

Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie	2011	Bernd Traxl	Institut für Psychosoziale Intervention und Kommunikationsforschung, Leopold-Franzens-Universität Inssbruck, Osterreich. Bernd.Traxl@uibk.ac.at	Therapeutic-pedagogic processes are above all orientated on cognitive, perceptive, mnestic or motoric deficits, particularly with children and adolescents. Thereby psychodynamic dimensions and structural skills are neglected. I want to focus on this underrepresented domain and place it in the centre of the therapeutic-pedagogic interest. The OPD-2 is currently the most sophisticated raster of psychic structure and so I use it for my theoretic frame of reference. The specific criteria are described to work out the concrete support in the context of therapeutic-pedagogic. On the basis of a short case study, I illustrate the developmental and modification possibilities to corroborate my belief, that therapeutic-pedagogic relations advance mutative process in the range of structural skills.

Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN	2011	Kevin K Yu, Charlton Cheung, Siew E Chua, Gráinne M McAlonan		"The question of whether Asperger syndrome can be distinguished from autism has attracted much debate and may even incur delay in diagnosis and intervention. Accordingly, there has been a proposal for Asperger syndrome to be subsumed under autism in the forthcoming Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, in 2013. One approach to resolve this question has been to adopt the criterion of absence of clinically significant language or cognitive delay--essentially, the ""absence of language delay."" To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of people with autism to compare absence with presence of language delay. It capitalizes on the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach to systematically explore the whole brain for anatomic correlates of delay and no delay in language acquisition in people with autism spectrum disorders."
21404153		Reflections on Asperger syndrome and comorbidity with psychotic disorders.	Actas espanolas de psiquiatria	2011	Marta Arrasate-Gil, Mónica Martínez-Cengotitabengoa, Purificación López-Peña		A reflection on Asperger syndrome (AS) and schizophrenia (S) comorbidity could be of great interest to psychiatrists for adult patients. There is little awareness of Asperger syndrome in adult clinical practice due to the early age of onset of the disease. When AS is present, it often persists for many years without being diagnosed. Patients come into contact with psychiatric services because they present a variety of psychopathological symptoms, and they are described as being odd, with bizarre behavior in addition to the rest of the symptomatology. We briefly report a case to illustrate this point. The circumstances on which clinicians should focus in order to distinguish between the two diagnoses and improve diagnostic reliability and the possibility of correct diagnosis are explained.
21399935	doi: 10.1007/s10802-011-9498-2	Social skills deficits and vocal characteristics of children with social phobia or Asperger's disorder: a comparative study.	Journal of abnormal child psychology	2011	Lindsay A Scharfstein, Deborah C Beidel, Valerie K Sims, Laura Rendon Finnell		Social skills deficits are commonly reported among children with social phobia (SP) and children with Asperger's Disorder (AD); however, a lack of direct comparison makes it unclear whether these groups, both of which endorse the presence of social anxiety, have similar or unique skills deficits. In this investigation, the social behaviors of children with SP (n=30) or AD (n=30) were compared to a typically developing (TD) peer group (n=30) during structured role play interactions. Data were analyzed using blinded observers' ratings of overt behaviors and digital vocal analysis of verbal communication. Compared to children with AD and TD children, children with SP exhibited less overall social skill, an ineffective ability to manage the conversational topic (pragmatic social behavior), and deficient speech production (speech and prosodic social behavior). There were no differences in observer ratings between children with AD and TD children. However, using digital analysis of vocal characteristics (i.e., intensity, pitch), distinct vocal patterns emerged. Specifically, children with AD spoke more softly than TD children, and had lower vocal pitch and less vocal pitch variability than children with SP. This pattern may be subjectively heard as monotonic speech. Consistent with a vocal pattern associated with heightened anxiety, children with SP spoke more softly and had less voice volume variation than TD children, and had higher vocal pitch and more vocal pitch variability (jitteriness) than children with AD. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.
21398562	doi: 10.1177/0883073810384264	Presence of cysts on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) in children with asperger disorder and nonverbal learning disabilities.	Journal of child neurology	2011	Margaret Semrud-Clikeman, Jodene Fine		The main purpose of this study was to report the existence of previously unidentified brain cysts or lesions in children with nonverbal learning disabilities, Asperger syndrome, or controls. The authors compared the incidence of cysts or lesions on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) in 28 children with nonverbal learning disability, 26 children with Asperger syndrome, and 24 typical controls for abnormalities. In this study, the authors found 25% of children previously diagnosed with nonverbal learning disability to have unsuspected brain abnormalities generally including cysts or lesions in the occipital region, compared with approximately 4% in the Asperger syndrome or control group. The cysts/lesions were found mainly in the occipital lobe, an area responsible for visual/spatial reasoning. It is appropriate to speculate that there might be a connection between anomalous brain development and skill differences among these groups.
21398041	doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2011.02.007	Increased serum androstenedione in adults with autism spectrum conditions.	Psychoneuroendocrinology	2011	Liliana Ruta, Erin Ingudomnukul, Kevin Taylor, Bhismadev Chakrabarti, Simon Baron-Cohen		Molecular and behavioural evidence points to an association between sex-steroid hormones and autism spectrum conditions (ASC) and/or autistic traits. Prenatal androgen levels are associated with autistic traits, and several genes involved in steroidogenesis are associated with autism, Asperger Syndrome and/or autistic traits. Furthermore, higher rates of androgen-related conditions (such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, hirsutism, acne and hormone-related cancers) are reported in women with autism spectrum conditions. A key question therefore is if serum levels of gonadal and adrenal sex-steroids (particularly testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androstenedione) are elevated in individuals with ASC. This was tested in a total sample of n=166 participants. The final eligible sample for hormone analysis comprised n=128 participants, n=58 of whom had a diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism (33 males and 25 females) and n=70 of whom were age- and IQ-matched typical controls (39 males and 31 females). ASC diagnosis (without any interaction with sex) strongly predicted androstenedione levels (p<0.01), and serum androstenedione levels were significantly elevated in the ASC group (Mann-Whitney W=2677, p=0.002), a result confirmed by permutation testing in females (permutation-corrected p=0.02). This result is discussed in terms of androstenedione being the immediate precursor of, and being converted into, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, or estrogens in hormone-sensitive tissues and organs.

The Clinical neuropsychologist	2011	Brenda M Stoesz, Janine M Montgomery, Sherri L Smart, Laurie-Ann M Hellsten		Due to the recent inclusion of Asperger's Disorder (AD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (APA, 1994) and the International Classification of Diseases (WHO, 1993), concerns regarding diagnosis of AD, particularly in adults, are emerging. Many existing instruments used to assess Pervasive Developmental Disorder are more appropriate for identifying Autistic Disorder (AU) in children, and their usefulness for assessing AD in adults is questionable. We describe and critically review five instruments created specifically for identifying AD in adults. Overall, the normative information provided is limited and evidence of the reliability and validity for each instrument is relatively poor. Further research and development is required before we would recommend one instrument over another for the assessment of AD in adults.

Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	2011	Benjamin E Yerys, Gregory L Wallace, Kathryn F Jankowski, Angela Bollich, Lauren Kenworthy		Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) often struggle with complex tasks, such as those requiring divided attention (simultaneously completing two independent tasks) that also place high demands on working memory. Prior research shows that divided attention is impaired in adults and children with ASD and is related to ASD and comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, but the impact on everyday functioning is unclear. Because ADHD symptoms are associated with poor divided attention and working memory performance in children with ASD, we also examined ADHD symptoms as moderators of divided attention performance. We examined performance on the Consonant Trigrams Test (CTT) between high-functioning 8- to 13-year-olds with ASD (n = 28) and typically developing controls (n = 18) matched on age and IQ. In the ASD group, we also correlated performance with ADHD symptoms and behavior ratings of everyday working memory. CTT performance in children with ASD was significantly worse than in matched controls. A significant correlation between CTT performance and everyday working memory was observed, but CTT performance was not related to comorbid ADHD symptoms in the ASD group. Divided attention with high working-memory demands is a relative weakness in children with high-functioning ASD; this weakness relates to everyday functioning, and it is independent from ADHD symptoms. That ADHD symptoms are not associated with divided attention performance is inconsistent with one prior investigation, which likely results from using different divided attention tasks in the two studies.

21388746	doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2011.01.024	A novel embryological theory of autism causation involving endogenous biochemicals capable of initiating cellular gene transcription: a possible link between twelve autism risk factors and the autism 'epidemic'.	Medical hypotheses	2011	Chiara R King	MHL, 2000 McElderry St., Baltimore, MD 21205, USA. ChiaraRKing@gmail.com	Human alpha-fetoprotein is a pregnancy-associated protein with an undetermined physiological role. As human alpha-fetoprotein binds retinoids and inhibits estrogen-dependent cancer cell proliferation, and because retinoic acid (a retinol metabolite) and estradiol (an estrogen) can both initiate cellular gene transcription, it is hypothesized here that alpha-fetoprotein functions during critical gestational periods to prevent retinoic acid and maternal estradiol from inappropriately stimulating gene expression in developing brain regions which are sensitive to these chemicals. Prenatal/maternal factors linked to increased autism risk include valproic acid, thalidomide, alcohol, rubella, cytomegalovirus, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autoimmune disease, stress, allergic reaction, and hypothyroidism. It will be shown how each of these risk factors may initiate expression of genes which are sensitive to retinoic acid and/or estradiol - whether by direct promotion or by reducing production of alpha-fetoprotein. It is thus hypothesized here that autism is not a genetic disorder, but is rather an epigenetic disruption in brain development caused by gestational exposure to chemicals and/or conditions which either inhibit alpha-fetoprotein production or directly promote retinoic acid-sensitive or estradiol-sensitive gene expression. This causation model leads to potential chemical explanations for autistic brain morphology, the distinct symptomatology of Asperger's syndrome, and the differences between high-functioning and low-functioning autism with regard to mental retardation, physical malformation, and sex ratio. It will be discussed how folic acid may cause autism under the retinoic acid/estradiol model, and the history of prenatal folic acid supplementation will be shown to coincide with the history of what is popularly known as the autism epidemic. It is thus hypothesized here that prenatal folic acid supplementation has contributed to the post-1980 increase in US autism diagnoses. In addition to explaining the epidemic within the wider retinoic acid/estradiol model of causation, this theory leads to potential explanations for certain genetic findings in autism, autistic regression, and changing trends in autism symptomatology with regard to mental retardation, wheat allergy, and gastrointestinal problems.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	Katri Kantojärvi, Ilona Kotala, Karola Rehnström, Tero Ylisaukko-Oja, Raija Vanhala, Taina Nieminen von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Irma Järvelä		About 80% of cases with autism express intellectual disability. Both in autism and in mental retardation without autism the majority of the cases are males, suggesting a X-chromosomal effect. In fact, some molecular evidence has been obtained for a common genetic background for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and X-linked mental retardation (XLMR). In several genome-wide scans (GWS), evidence for linkage at X-chromosome has been reported including the GWS of Finnish ASD families with the highest multipoint lod score (MLS) of 2.75 obtained close to DXS7132 at Xq11.1. To further dissect the relationship between autism and genes implicated in XLMR, we have fine-mapped Xq11.1-q21.33 and analyzed five candidate genes in the region. We refined the region using 26 microsatellite markers and linkage analysis in 99 Finnish families with ASD. The most significant evidence for linkage was observed at DXS1225 on Xq21.1 with a nonparametric multipoint NPL(all) value of 3.43 (P = 0.0004). We sequenced the coding regions and splice sites of RPS6KA6 and ZNF711 residing at the peak region in 42 male patients from families contributing to the linkage. We also analyzed ACSL4 and DLG3, which have previously been known to cause XLMR and IL1RAPL2, a homologous gene for IL1RAPL1 that is mutated in autism and XLMR. A total of six novel and 11 known single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Further studies are warranted to analyze the candidate genes at Xq11.1-q21.33.
21363869	doi: 10.1177/1362361310386501	Lexical processing in individuals with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Samantha Speirs, Greg Yelland, Nicole Rinehart, Bruce Tonge		The presence or absence of clinically delayed language development prior to 3 years of age is a key, but contentious, clinical feature distinguishing autism from Asperger's disorder. The aim of this study was to examine language processing in children with high-functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger's disorder (AD) using a task which taps lexical processing, a core language ability. Eleven individuals with HFA, 11 with AD and 11 typically developing (TD) individuals completed a masked priming task, a psycholinguistic paradigm that directly examines lexical processes. Within-group analyses revealed the AD and TD groups had intact lexical processing systems and orthographic processing of the written word. The outcomes for the HFA group were ambiguous, suggesting that their lexical processing system is either delayed or is structurally different. This suggests that fundamental differences in lexical processing exist between HFA and AD and remain evident later in development.
21360828	doi: 10.1002/aur.176	Behavioral and cardiac responses to emotional stroop in adults with autism spectrum disorders: influence of medication.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	Karen J Mathewson, Irene E Drmic, Michelle K Jetha, Susan E Bryson, Joel O Goldberg, Geoffrey B Hall, Diane L Santesso, Sidney J Segalowitz, Louis A Schmidt		Researchers have recently hypothesized that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may be partly characterized by physiological over-arousal. One way to assess physiological arousal is through autonomic measures. Here heart period (HP) and parasympathetic activity measured by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were examined in adults with ASD and matched controls at rest and during performance of an emotional Stroop task. Resting HP and RSA were lower in adults with ASD than in matched controls, consistent with hypothesized over-arousal in ASD. However, dividing the ASD group on the basis of antipsychotic medication usage revealed that group differences in autonomic arousal may be related to the effects of these medications or their correlates. Autonomic adjustments for Stroop performance were comparable across groups, but in the control group, larger RSA reductions were correlated with faster responding (i.e., better performance). This relation was reversed in the unmedicated ASD group and absent in the medicated ASD group. Findings highlight the importance of considering medication status in the recently burgeoning area of psychophysiological studies of autism.

American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics	2011	Angela Scheuerle, Kathleen Wilson		Microdeletions of PARK2 have been reported previously in seven patients with autism spectrum disorder. There are no reports of PARK2 microduplications in this population. Presented are two patients, one with deletion and the other with duplication, both with autism spectrum disorder, though their syndromic phenotypes vary. The deletion patient is cognitively normal and ectomorphic: the duplication patient is cognitively impaired, underweight and short. Further, the microduplication patient has demonstrated adverse medication reactions to psychotropic medications active in the dopamine metabolic pathway: cyclopentolate, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate. These patients support an association between PARK2 mutations and autism spectrum disorder and suggest that duplications may be equally causative. It is hypothesized that the disparate patient phenotypes may represent a deletion/duplication syndrome and that the adverse medication reactions may be a pharmacogenetic phenomenon.
21358903	doi: 10.1901/jaba.2010.43-425	The effects of variable-time delivery of food items and praise on problem behavior reinforced by escape.	Journal of applied behavior analysis	2010	Joanna E Lomas, Wayne W Fisher, Michael E Kelley		Prior research indicates that reinforcement of an appropriate response (e.g., compliance) can produce concomitant reductions in problem behavior reinforced by escape when problem behavior continues to produce negative reinforcement (e.g., Lalli et al., 1999). These effects may be due to a preference for positive over negative reinforcement or to positive reinforcement acting as an abolishing operation, rendering demands less aversive and escape from demands less effective as negative reinforcement. In the current investigation, we delivered a preferred food item and praise on a variable-time 15-s schedule while providing escape for problem behavior on a fixed-ratio 1 schedule in a demand condition for 3 participants with problem behavior maintained by negative reinforcement. Results for all 3 participants showed that variable-time delivery of preferred edible items reduced problem behavior even though escape continued to be available for these responses. These findings are discussed in the context of motivating operations.
21356316	doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.067	Specialization of right temporo-parietal junction for mentalizing and its relation to social impairments in autism.	NeuroImage	2011			"Over the last 25 years, ""mindblindness"" (deficits in representing mental states) has been one of the primary explanations behind the hallmark social-communication difficulties in autism spectrum conditions (ASC). However, highlighting neural systems responsible for mindblindness and their relation to variation in social impairments has remained elusive. In this study we show that one of the neural systems responsible for mindblindness in ASC and its relation to social impairments is the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ). Twenty-nine adult males with ASC and 33 age and IQ-matched Controls were scanned with fMRI while making reflective mentalizing or physical judgments about themselves or another person. Regions of interest within mentalizing circuitry were examined for between-group differences in activation during mentalizing about self and other and correlations with social symptom severity. RTPJ was the only mentalizing region that responded atypically in ASC. In Controls, RTPJ was selectively more responsive to mentalizing than physical judgments. This selectivity for mentalizing was not apparent in ASC and generalized across both self and other. Selectivity of RTPJ for mentalizing was also associated with the degree of reciprocal social impairment in ASC. These results lend support to the idea that RTPJ is one important neural system behind mindblindness in ASC. Understanding the contribution of RTPJ in conjunction with other neural systems responsible for other component processes involved in social cognition will be illuminating in fully explaining the hallmark social-communication difficulties of autism."

Cancer investigation	2011	Ansgar Asperger, Christof Renner, Mandy Menzel, Rolf Gebhardt, Jürgen Meixensberger, Frank Gaunitz		"Human glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant brain tumor in adults and is difficult to treat. Recently, it was demonstrated that the dipeptide carnosine inhibits tumor growth, but the main molecular targets are not known. Therefore, a proteomics study with glioblastoma cells treated with carnosine was performed. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight detected 31 proteins expressed differentially under the influence of carnosine. Finally, peptide mass fingerprinting identified the ""BCL2-associated athanogene 2"" and the ""von Hippel-Lindau binding protein 1"" among other proteins, linking the action of carnosine to protein folding and HIF-1α signalling."

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Cynthia A Molloy, Donna S Murray, Rachel Akers, Terry Mitchell, Patricia Manning-Courtney		The aim of this study was to examine the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) as it is commonly used in clinical practice. ADOS classifications were compared to final diagnoses given by a multidisciplinary team to 584 children referred for evaluation for possible autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. A total of 177 children were evaluated with a Module 1 (87 No Words), 198 with a Module 2 (90 < 5 years) and 209 with a Module 3. Of these, 142 (26%) were diagnosed with autism, 185 (32%) with non-autism ASD, and 257 (44%) with non-spectrum disorders. Sensitivities were moderate to high on both original and revised algorithms, while specificities were substantially lower than those previously reported. This difference is likely attributable to the composition of the sample that included many children with a broad array of developmental and behavioral disorders. The clinical impression of the team member who administered the ADOS was critical to the accuracy of the overall diagnosis. Using numeric scores alone resulted in misclassification from false positive results. The study highlights the importance of the qualitative interactions of the ADOS activities as well as the score in diagnostic decision making.

Journal of pain and symptom management	2011	Yutaka Hatano, Miwa Yamada, Kenji Fukui		Communication with children who have life-threatening illnesses is a major challenge. Communication practices are greatly influenced by factors such as the child's age, the parents' wishes, and the cultural norms. This article presents the case of a 12-year-old Japanese boy with advanced hepatoblastoma. The patient also was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, which impairs interpersonal communication. The case is discussed from the perspective of clinical ethics, especially with regard to truth telling. The health care team faced an ethical dilemma because of the complications involved. Physicians treating children with cancer should be aware of these issues to be able to effectively communicate with their patients.
21328568	doi: 10.1002/aur.175	Behavioral profiles of mouse models for autism spectrum disorders.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	Elodie Ey, Claire S Leblond, Thomas Bourgeron		Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are characterized by impairments in reciprocal social communication, and stereotyped verbal and nonverbal behaviors. In approximately 10-25% of the affected individuals, a genetic mutation associated with the condition can be identified. Recently, mutations altering synapse formation, cellular/synaptic growth rate and regulation of excitatory and inhibitory currents were identified in patients with intellectual disability, typical autism, Asperger syndrome or neurological syndromes associated with autistic traits. Following these genetic findings, mouse models carrying mutations similar to those identified in patients have been generated. These models offer the opportunity to investigate in vivo the physiological and behavioral consequences of the mutations. Here, we review the existing data on the phenotypes of mice carrying mutations in genes associated with ASD including neuroligin, neurexin and Shank mutant mice as well as the Fmr1, Mecp2, Ube3a, Nf1, Pten and Tsc1/Tsc2 mutant mice. The diversity and complexity of the phenotype of these mouse models reflect the broad range of phenotypes observed in patients with ASD. Remarkably, results from therapeutic approaches (e.g., modulation of gene expression, administration of pharmacological and nonpharmacological substances, enriched environment) are encouraging since some behavioral alterations could be reversed even when treatment was performed on adult mice. These ongoing studies should therefore increase our understanding of the biological alterations associated with ASD as well as the development of knowledge-based treatments.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Lisa M J Andersen, Katharina Näswall, Irina Manouilenko, Lena Nylander, Johan Edgar, Riva Ariella Ritvo, Edward Ritvo, Susanne Bejerot		There is a paucity of diagnostic instruments for adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study evaluates the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the Ritvo Autism and Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R), an 80-item self-rating scale designed to assist clinicians diagnosing ASD in adults. It was administered to 75 adults with ASD and 197 comparison cases. Also, a subset completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Three out of four subscales had high internal consistency. Sensitivity was 91% and specificity was 93%. The ASD subjects had significantly higher mean scores on all subscales. ASD females had higher scores than ASD males on the sensory motor subscale, a dimension not included in the AQ. RAADS-R showed promising test re-test reliability.
21327345	doi: 10.3758/s13423-010-0037-x	Listener vs. speaker-oriented aspects of speech: studying the disfluencies of individuals with autism spectrum disorders.	Psychonomic bulletin & review	2011	Johanna K Lake, Karin R Humphreys, Shannon Cardy		"This study investigates the role of disfluencies such as ""um"" or ""uh"" in conversation to discern whether these features of speech serve listener- or speaker-oriented functions by looking at their occurrence (or lack of occurrence) in the speech of participants with autism. Since the characteristic egocentricity of individuals with autism means they should engage in minimal listener-oriented behavior, they are a useful group to differentiate these functions. Transcription, analysis and categorization of 26 spontaneous language samples were derived from age-matched native English-speaking controls and high-functioning individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs). Results showed that individuals with ASD produced fewer filled-pause words (ums and uhs) and revisions than controls, but more silent pauses and disfluent repetitions. Filled-pause words therefore appear to be listener-oriented features of speech."

21311963	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1186-0	A comparison of autism prevalence trends in Denmark and Western Australia.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Erik T Parner, Poul Thorsen, Glenys Dixon, Nicholas de Klerk, Helen Leonard, Natasha Nassar, Jenny Bourke, Carol Bower, Emma J Glasson		Prevalence statistics for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) vary widely across geographical boundaries. Some variation can be explained by diagnostic methods, case ascertainment and age at diagnosis. This study compared prevalence statistics for two distinct geographical regions, Denmark and Western Australia, both of which have had population-based registers and consistent classification systems operating over the past decade. Overall ASD prevalence rates were higher in Denmark (68.5 per 10,000 children) compared with Western Australia (51.0 per 10,000 children), while the diagnosis of childhood autism was more prevalent in Western Australia (39.3 per 10,000 children) compared with Denmark (21.8 per 10,000 children). These differences are probably caused by local phenomena affecting case ascertainment but influence from biological or geographical factors may exist.
21310248	doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.02.003	Dissociation of mirroring and mentalising systems in autism.	NeuroImage	2011	Lauren E Marsh, Antonia F de C Hamilton		The role of mirror neuron systems and mentalising systems in causing poor social and communication skills in individuals with autistic spectrum conditions is hotly debated. We studied 18 adults with autistic spectrum conditions in comparison to 19 age and IQ matched typical individuals. Behavioural assessments revealed difficulties in mental state attribution and action comprehension in the autism sample. We examined brain responses when observing rational and irrational hand actions, because these actions engage mirror and mentalising components of the social brain respectively. Both typical and autistic participants activated the left anterior intraparietal sulcus component of the mirror system when viewing hand actions compared to moving shapes. The typical but not autistic participants activated the posterior mid cingulate cortex/supplementary motor area and bilateral fusiform cortex when viewing hand actions. When viewing irrational hand actions, the medial prefrontal cortex of typical participants deactivated but this region did not distinguish the different stimuli in autistic participants. These results suggest that parietal mirror regions function normally in autism, while differences in action understanding could be due to abnormal function of cingulate, fusiform and medial prefrontal regions. Thus, brain regions associated with mirroring and mentalising functions are differentially affected in autistic spectrum conditions.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2011	William Mandy, Tony Charman, Jane Gilmour, David Skuse		Pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) is the most common and least satisfactory of the PDD diagnoses. It is not formally operationalized, which limits its reliability and has hampered attempts to assess its validity. We aimed, first, to improve the reliability and replicability of PDD-NOS by operationalizing its DSM-IV-TR description and, second, to test its validity through comparison with autistic disorder (AD) and Asperger's disorder (AsD). In a sample of 256 young people (mean age = 9.1 years) we used Developmental, Diagnostic and Dimensional (3Di) algorithmic analysis to classify DSM-IV-TR AD (n = 97), AsD (n = 93) and PDD-NOS (n = 66). Groups were compared on independent measures of core PDD symptomatology, associated autistic features, and intelligence. Contrary to the assumption that PDD-NOS is heterogeneous, almost all (97%) of those with PDD-NOS had one distinct symptom pattern, namely impairments in social reciprocity and communication, without significant repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (RSB). Compared to AD and AsD, they had comparably severe but more circumscribed social communication difficulties, with fewer non-social features of autism, such as sensory, feeding and visuo-spatial problems. These individuals appear to have a distinct variant of autism that does not merely sit at the less severe end of the same continuum of symptoms. The current draft guidelines for DSM-V, which mandate the presence of RSBs for any PDD diagnosis, would exclude such people from the autistic spectrum.

21287254	doi: 10.1007/s10803-011-1180-6	Judgments of cause and blame: sensitivity to intentionality in Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Shelley Channon, David Lagnado, Sian Fitzpatrick, Helena Drury, Isabelle Taylor		Sensitivity to intentionality in people with Asperger's syndrome (AS) and matched controls was investigated using two scenario-based tasks. The first compared intentional and unintentional human actions and physical events leading to the same negative outcomes. The second compared intentional actions that varied in their subjective and objective likelihood of bringing about a negative outcome. Whilst adults with AS did not differ from controls in their judgments of causality, or in their blame judgments in relation to non-mentalistic factors, they showed heightened sensitivity to mentalistic considerations in their attributions of blame. They made greater differentiation than controls between intentional and unintentional actions, and also between actions that the protagonists believed to be likely versus unlikely to lead to negative consequences.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Allison B Ratto, Lauren Turner-Brown, Betty M Rupp, Gary B Mesibov, David L Penn		This study piloted a role play assessment of conversational skills for adolescents and young adults with high-functioning autism/Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS). Participants completed two semi-structured role plays, in which social context was manipulated by changing the confederate's level of interest in the conversation. Participants' social behavior was rated via a behavioral coding system, and performance was compared across contexts and groups. An interaction effect was found for several items, whereby control participants showed significant change across context, while participants with HFA/AS showed little or no change. Total change across contexts was significantly correlated with related social constructs and significantly predicted ASD. The findings are discussed in terms of the potential utility of the CASS in the evaluation of social skill.

Journal of child neurology	2011	William J Barrow, Margie Jaworski, Pasquale J Accardo		The records of 954 ambulatory children presenting for initial evaluation to a university developmental pediatrician were reviewed for the prevalence of persistent toe walking and associated tight heel cords. The incidence of persistent toe walking (20.1%) and tight heel cords (12.0%) were found to be higher in 324 children with an autistic spectrum disorder but lower (10.0%/3.0%) in 30 children with Asperger syndrome. These results confirm the previously reported high incidence of toe walking in children with autism and with language disorders and also raise the possibility of a secondary orthopedic deformity that can complicate long-term management of these patients.

Neuroscience letters	2011	Han Hsuan Yang, Alexander N Savostyanov, Arthur C Tsai, Michelle Liou		EEG reactions in emotional face recognition were studied in five participants with Asperger syndrome (AS) and seven control subjects. Control subjects showed a spectral power increase following the stimulus onset in two time-frequency intervals-(1) 150-300ms in the 1-16Hz frequency range and (2) 300-650ms in the 1-8Hz range. Also, alpha/beta desynchronization occurred 400-1000ms after the stimulus onset with maximal amplitude in the posterior region. Theta synchronization (4-8Hz) was weaker in the AS group than in the control group, but beta2 desynchronization was stronger in the AS group. The results were interpreted in terms of automatic and voluntary control of perception.

This is the translation and evaluation of 3 questionnaires in France for TED SDI and control adolescents.

Neurocase	2011	Massimiliano Conson, Sara Salzano, Dario Grossi		A striking special ability in arranging picture stories was reported in an Asperger child (C.M.) showing an exceptional performance on Wechsler picture arrangement subtest. Neuropsychological examination did not disclose visuoperceptual and spatial defects, or working memory, attention and executive disorders, but revealed an attentional bias towards local details of complex structures. A specific assessment of C.M.'s understanding of picture stories demonstrated that, with respect to normal controls, he showed an enhanced ability to detect causal links among elements of a story. These findings provide support to the hypothesis that savantism can be related to strong systemizing in autism.

Assessment	2011	James Holdnack, Gerald Goldstein, Lisa Drozdick		Previous research using the Wechsler scales has identified areas of cognitive weaknesses in children, adolescents, and adults diagnosed with Autism or Asperger's syndrome. The current study evaluates cognitive functioning in adolescents and adults diagnosed with Autism or Asperger's syndrome using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) and the Social Perception subtest from the Advanced Clinical Solutions. Deficits in social perception, verbal comprehension, and processing speed were found in the Autism sample. Additionally, they exhibited inconsistent performance on auditory working memory and perceptual reasoning tasks. The Asperger's syndrome group had better overall cognitive skills than the Autism group, but compared with controls, they had weaknesses in processing speed, social perception, and components of auditory working memory. Both groups had relatively low scores on the WAIS-IV Comprehension subtest compared with the other verbal comprehension subtests. Clinical application and utility of the WAIS-IV and Social Perception in Autism Spectrum Disorders are discussed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Heather M Brown, Perry D Klein		This research compared the written compositions of 16 adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders and 16 neurotypical control participants, and examined the influence of theory of mind on their writing. Participants ranging in age from 17 years to 42 years, matched on Vocabulary subtest scores from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (1997), completed the Social Attribution Task and wrote an expository and a narrative text. Texts were assessed on 18 variables representing quality, mechanics, and length. It was found that adults with HFASD wrote lower quality narrative and expository texts, and narratives of shorter length. Theory of mind was positively associated with writing quality and text length across both genres.
21195104	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.12.026	Spontaneous but not explicit processing of positive sentences impaired in Asperger's syndrome: pupillometric evidence.	Neuropsychologia	2011	Lars Kuchinke, Dana Schneider, Sonja A Kotz, Arthur M Jacobs		Emotional prosody provides important cues for understanding the emotions of others in every day communication. Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a developmental disorder characterised by pronounced deficits in socio-emotional communication, including difficulties in the domain of prosody processing. We measured pupillary responses as an index of emotional prosodic processing when 15 participants with AS and 19 non-clinical control participants listened to positive, negative and neutral prosodic sentences. This occurred under a spontaneous and an explicit task instruction. In the explicit processing condition, the AS group and the non-clinical controls showed increased pupil dilations to positively and negatively intoned sentences when judging the valence of that prosodic sentence. This suggests higher processing demands for emotionally arousing information, as the effect was not found in comparison to neutrally intoned sentences. In the spontaneous processing condition, controls also responded with increased pupil dilations to positively intoned sentences, whilst individuals with AS showed increased pupil dilations to negative sentences. The latter result is further supported by diminished ratings of emotionally intense sentences in the AS group compared to healthy controls. Perception and recognition of positively valenced sentences in individuals with AS appears impaired and dependent on the general task set-up. Diminished pupil dilations in spontaneous positive processing conditions as well as reduced positive valence ratings give strong indications for a general negative processing bias of verbal information for adult individuals diagnosed with AS.

Autism research and treatment	2011	Carla Schmidt, Janine P Stichter, Kristin Lierheimer, Stephanie McGhee, Karen V O'Connor		This study evaluated the impact of generalization of the Social Competence Intervention-Adolescent (SCI-A) curriculum in a school setting for individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger's Syndrome (N = 6). This study examined to what degree the generalization of the SCI-A curriculum could be measured when delivered in a school setting. Across the six participants preliminary results suggest improvement on teacher reports of social skills and executive functioning. Some improvements were also evident in direct measures of facial-expression recognition. Data collected in the nonintervention settings indicated that some generalization of social interaction skills may have occurred for all six participants. Future research directions are discussed.
22937248	pii: 405849	Parent report of community psychiatric comorbid diagnoses in autism spectrum disorders.	Autism research and treatment	2011	Rebecca E Rosenberg, Walter E Kaufmann, J Kiely Law, Paul A Law		We used a national online registry to examine variation in cumulative prevalence of community diagnosis of psychiatric comorbidity in 4343 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Adjusted multivariate logistic regression models compared influence of individual, family, and geographic factors on cumulative prevalence of parent-reported anxiety disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder or attention deficit disorder. Adjusted odds of community-assigned lifetime psychiatric comorbidity were significantly higher with each additional year of life, with increasing autism severity, and with Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified compared with autistic disorder. Overall, in this largest study of parent-reported community diagnoses of psychiatric comorbidity, gender, autistic regression, autism severity, and type of ASD all emerged as significant factors correlating with cumulative prevalence. These findings could suggest both underlying trends in actual comorbidity as well as variation in community interpretation and application of comorbid diagnoses in ASD.

Autism research and treatment	2011	Kate Sofronoff, Johann Eloff, Jeanie Sheffield, Tony Attwood		The study was conducted to examine relationships between affectionate behavior in children with Asperger syndrome and variables likely to influence its expression (e.g., tactile sensitivity, social ability). It also evaluated the impact of a cognitive behavioral intervention that aimed to improve a child's understanding and expression of affection. Twenty-one children, aged 7 to 12 years, participated in the trial. The results showed significant correlations between measures of affection and tactile sensitivity and social ability. After attending the 5-week program, parents identified significant increases in the appropriateness of children's affectionate behavior both towards immediate family and people outside the immediate family, despite reporting no significant changes in their child's general difficulties with affectionate behavior. There was a significant improvement in children's understanding of the purpose of affection. The findings are discussed as well as the limitations of the study.
22506299		The effect of a music therapy social skills training program on improving social competence in children and adolescents with social skills deficits.	Journal of music therapy	2011	Lori F Gooding	The University of Kentucky, USA.	Three separate studies were conducted in school, residential and after-school care settings to test the effectiveness of a music therapy-based social skills intervention program on improving social competence in children and adolescents. A total of 45 children (n = 12; n = 13; n = 20) aged 6-17 years with social skills deficits participated in a group-based five session intervention program. The same curriculum, adapted to be age appropriate, was used at all 3 sites. Specific deficits within the social skills areas of peer relations and self-management skills were targeted. Active interventions like music performance, movement to music and improvisation were used. Cognitive-behavioral techniques like modeling, feedback, transfer training and problem solving were also incorporated. Data on social functioning were collected before, during, and after the music therapy intervention from participants, appropriate adult personnel and via behavioral observations. Results indicated that significant improvements in social functioning were found in (a) school participant pre and post self-ratings, (b) researcher pre and post ratings of school participants, (c) case manager's pre and post treatment ratings for the residential participants, (d) after-school care participants' pre and post self-ratings, and (e) behavioral observations at all three settings. Additional changes, although not significant, were noted in teacher ratings, residential participant self- and peer ratings, and after-school case manager ratings. Results from these studies suggest that the music therapy intervention was effective in improving social competence in children and adolescents with social deficits. More research is warranted to provide additional guidance about the use of music therapy interventions to improve social functioning.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2010	Simon Wallace, Catherine Sebastian, Elizabeth Pellicano, Jeremy Parr, Anthony Bailey		"Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show difficulties identifying familiar faces, recognizing emotional expressions and judging eye-gaze direction. Recent research suggests that relatives of individuals with AS also show impairments in some aspects of face processing but no study has comprehensively assessed the nature and extent of face-processing difficulties in a group of relatives. This study compared the performance of 22 parents/adult siblings of individuals with ASD (""relatives"" group), 26 adults with ASD, and 26 typically developing adults on tasks of face discrimination, facial expression recognition and judging eye-gaze direction. Relatives of individuals with ASD were less able to discriminate subtle differences between faces than typically developing adults, but were more sensitive to such differences than adults with ASD. Furthermore, relatives were significantly worse at identifying expressions of fear and disgust than typically developing adults and failed to show the typical sensitivity to direct compared with averted eye-gaze direction--a strikingly similar pattern to that observed in adults with ASD. These findings show that atypical patterns of face processing are found in some relatives of individuals with ASD and suggest that these difficulties may represent a cognitive endophenotype."

Analysis of a homogenous subset of families with ASP may help to address the corresponding effect of genetic heterogeneity on identifying ASD genetic risk factors. To examine the hypothesis that common variation is important in ASD, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 124 ASP families in a discovery data set and 110 ASP families in a validation data set. We prioritized the top 100 association results from both cohorts by employing a ranking strategy. Novel regions on 5q21.1 (P = 9.7 × 10(-7) ) and 15q22.1-q22.2 (P = 7.3 × 10(-6) ) were our most significant findings in the combined data set. Three chromosomal regions showing association, 3p14.2 (P = 3.6 × 10(-6) ), 3q25-26 (P = 6.0 × 10(-5) ) and 3p23 (P = 3.3 × 10(-4) ) overlapped linkage regions reported in Finnish ASP families, and eight association regions overlapped ASD linkage areas. Our findings suggest that ASP shares both ASD-related genetic risk factors, as well as has genetic risk factors unique to the ASP phenotype.
21149420	doi: 10.1177/1362361310373704	A quantitative measure of JS's memory.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Dorit Ben Shalom, Yifat Faran, Jill Boucher		JS is a highly able, well-educated 37 year old man with Asperger syndrome. A recent qualitative paper (Boucher, 2007) described his self-report of verbal and visual memory difficulties. The present paper used the WMS-III to compare the memory profile of JS to that of the adults with HFA in the Williams et al. (2005) WMS-III paper. Results show that JS's self-report of his memory difficulties can by and large be supported, that JS's memory performance is at the lower end of the group examined in the Williams et al. (2005) paper, and that, unlike the group profile in Williams et al. (2005), JS shows reduced performance on both verbal and visual measures of memory. A qualitative analysis of JS's performance raises the possibility that JS is using language to retain details he can generalize over, as a compensatory strategy for some reductions in episodic memory.

21134386	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.11.042	What's in a voice? Prosody as a test case for the Theory of Mind account of autism.	Neuropsychologia	2011	Coralie Chevallier, Ira Noveck, Francesca Happé, Deirdre Wilson		The human voice conveys a variety of information about people's feelings, emotions and mental states. Some of this information relies on sophisticated Theory of Mind (ToM) skills, whilst others are simpler and do not require ToM. This variety provides an interesting test case for the ToM account of autism, which would predict greater impairment as ToM requirements increase. In this paper, we draw on psychological and pragmatic theories to classify vocal cues according to the amount of mindreading required to identify them. Children with a high functioning Autism Spectrum Disorder and matched controls were tested in three experiments where the speakers' state had to be extracted from their vocalizations. Although our results confirm that people with autism have subtle difficulties dealing with vocal cues, they show a pattern of performance that is inconsistent with the view that atypical recognition of vocal cues is caused by impaired ToM.

Biological psychiatry	2010	Stephanie Spengler, Geoffrey Bird, Marcel Brass		Anecdotal evidence has noted that individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) frequently exhibit heightened spontaneous imitative behavior, with symptoms of echolalia and echopraxia. This is contrasted by empiric reports that ASC results in decreased imitation and an underlying deficit in the mirror system, leading to impaired social understanding. Thus, it remains unclear whether automatic imitation is enhanced in ASC and how this is related to poorer social abilities.

Research in developmental disabilities	2011	Lars Klintwall, Anette Holm, Mats Eriksson, Lotta Höglund Carlsson, Martina Barnevik Olsson, Asa Hedvall, Christopher Gillberg, Elisabeth Fernell		"Sensory abnormalities were assessed in a population-based group of 208 20-54-month-old children, diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and referred to a specialized habilitation centre for early intervention. The children were subgrouped based upon degree of autistic symptoms and cognitive level by a research team at the centre. Parents were interviewed systematically about any abnormal sensory reactions in the child. In the whole group, pain and hearing were the most commonly affected modalities. Children in the most typical autism subgroup (nuclear autism with no learning disability) had the highest number of affected modalities. The children who were classified in an ""autistic features"" subgroup had the lowest number of affected modalities. There were no group differences in number of affected sensory modalities between groups of different cognitive levels or level of expressive speech. The findings provide support for the notion that sensory abnormality is very common in young children with autism. This symptom has been proposed for inclusion among the diagnostic criteria for ASD in the upcoming DSM-V."

Neuropsychologia	2011	Pablo Barttfeld, Bruno Wicker, Sebastián Cukier, Silvana Navarta, Sergio Lew, Mariano Sigman		Over the last years, increasing evidence has fuelled the hypothesis that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition of altered brain functional connectivity. The great majority of these empirical studies relies on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) which has a relatively poor temporal resolution. Only a handful of studies has examined networks emerging from dynamic coherence at the millisecond resolution and there are no investigations of coherence at the lowest frequencies in the power spectrum-which has recently been shown to reflect long-range cortico-cortical connections. Here we used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess dynamic brain connectivity in ASD focusing in the low-frequency (delta) range. We found that connectivity patterns were distinct in ASD and control populations and reflected a double dissociation: ASD subjects lacked long-range connections, with a most prominent deficit in fronto-occipital connections. Conversely, individuals with ASD showed increased short-range connections in lateral-frontal electrodes. This effect between categories showed a consistent parametric dependency: as ASD severity increased, short-range coherence was more pronounced and long-range coherence decreased. Theoretical arguments have been proposed arguing that distinct patterns of connectivity may result in networks with different efficiency in transmission of information. We show that the networks in ASD subjects have less Clustering coefficient, greater Characteristic Path Length than controls - indicating that the topology of the network departs from small-world behaviour - and greater modularity. Together these results show that delta-band coherence reveal qualitative and quantitative aspects associated with ASD pathology.

Progress in brain research	2010	Simon Baron-Cohen	Department of Psychiatry, Autism Research Centre, Cambridge University, Douglas House, Cambridge, UK. sb205@cam.ac.uk	Females in the general population on average have a stronger drive to empathize, and males in the general population on average have a stronger drive to systemize. Evidence related to these claims is reviewed. People with autism spectrum conditions have below average empathy alongside intact or even above average interest in systems. As such, they can be conceptualized as an extreme of the typical male brain.
21086798		Autistic spectrum disorder: the challenge for dentists.	Dentistry today	2010	Marvin H Berman	marvy18@prodigy.net	Those who actively work with children are, with increasing frequency, encountering patients who have been diagnosed with autistic disorders. Often, dentists may be the first healthcare providers to recognize that a 1- or 2-year-old child has some type of extraordinary pervasive behavioral disorder that a parent, fearing the worst, may have suspected instinctively and emotionally but never faced objectively. Currently, there are no empirical biological tests (eg, blood tests or brain scans) for ASD that are reliable. The definitive diagnosis of ASD is usually made by pediatricians, psychologists, or psychiatrists who institute a process of analysis which involves a developmental and clinical history, tests for cognitive function, and assessment of receptive and expressive language skills. The etiology of ASD is an enigma. Highly regarded researchers are of the opinion that there is probably more than one cause since the disorder can have such disparate manifestations. Genetics, environmental poisons, neurologic psychopathy, dietary deficiencies, and allergies have all been implicated. Pervasive developmental disorders, Asperger's syndrome, Rett syndrome, and childhood degenerative disorders are all considered a part of the ASD group, but the distinction between the various entities is not always clear. Given the fact that the etiology and the increased incidence of the various ASDs are scientifically puzzling, treatment modalities tend to be wide ranging and very much trial and error, especially since there is no cure. Dental professionals who treat patients with ASDs should be knowledgeable about the special needs of not only these patients, but also of their parents.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Riva Ariella Ritvo, Edward R Ritvo, Donald Guthrie, Max J Ritvo, Demetra H Hufnagel, William McMahon, Bruce Tonge, David Mataix-Cols, Amita Jassi, Tony Attwood, Johann Eloff		The Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale-Revised (RAADS-R) is a valid and reliable instrument to assist the diagnosis of adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The 80-question scale was administered to 779 subjects (201 ASD and 578 comparisons). All ASD subjects met inclusion criteria: DSM-IV-TR, ADI/ADOS diagnoses and standardized IQ testing. Mean scores for each of the questions and total mean ASD vs. the comparison groups' scores were significantly different (p < .0001). Concurrent validity with Constantino Social Responsiveness Scale-Adult = 95.59%. Sensitivity = 97%, specificity = 100%, test-retest reliability r = .987. Cronbach alpha coefficients for the subscales and 4 derived factors were good. We conclude that the RAADS-R is a useful adjunct diagnostic tool for adults with ASD.

Cerebellum (London, England)	2011	Chloe Stanley-Cary, Nicole Rinehart, Bruce Tonge, Owen White, Joanne Fielding		It remains unclear whether autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) exist on a symptom continuum or are separate disorders with discrete neurobiological underpinnings. In addition to impairments in communication and social cognition, motor deficits constitute a significant clinical feature in both disorders. It has been suggested that motor deficits and in particular the integrity of cerebellar modulation of movement may differentiate these disorders. We used a simple volitional saccade task to comprehensively profile the integrity of voluntary ocular motor behaviour in individuals with high functioning autism (HFA) or AD, and included measures sensitive to cerebellar dysfunction. We tested three groups of age-matched young males with normal intelligence (full scale, verbal, and performance IQ estimates >70) aged between 11 and 19 years; nine with AD, eight with HFA, and ten normally developing males as the comparison group. Overall, the metrics and dynamics of the voluntary saccades produced in this task were preserved in the AD group. In contrast, the HFA group demonstrated relatively preserved mean measures of ocular motricity with cerebellar-like deficits demonstrated in increased variability on measures of response time, final eye position, and movement dynamics. These deficits were considered to be consistent with reduced cerebellar online adaptation of movement. The results support the notion that the integrity of cerebellar modulation of movement may be different in AD and HFA, suggesting potentially differential neurobiological substrates may underpin these complex disorders.

PloS one	2010	Tiziana Zalla, Elena Daprati, Anca-Maria Sav, Pauline Chaste, Daniele Nico, Marion Leboyer		Memory for action is enhanced if individuals are allowed to perform the corresponding movements, compared to when they simply listen to them (enactment effect). Previous studies have shown that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) have difficulties with processes involving the self, such as autobiographical memories and self performed actions. The present study aimed at assessing memory for action in Asperger Syndrome (AS). We investigated whether adults with AS would benefit from the enactment effect when recalling a list of previously performed items vs. items that were only visually and verbally experienced through three experimental tasks (Free Recall, Old/New Recognition and Source Memory). The results showed that while performance on Recognition and Source Memory tasks was preserved in individuals with AS, the enactment effect for self-performed actions was not consistently present, as revealed by the lower number of performed actions being recalled on the Free Recall test, as compared to adults with typical development. Subtle difficulties in encoding specific motor and proprioceptive signals during action execution in individuals with AS might affect retrieval of relevant personal episodic information. These disturbances might be associated to an impaired action monitoring system.

20964510	doi: 10.3109/02699206.2010.511408	Linguistic reflections of social engagement in Asperger discourse and narratives: A quantitative analysis of two cases.	Clinical linguistics & phonetics	2010	Jussi Niemi, Lidia Otsa, Aleksandra Evtyukova, Laura Lehtoaro, John Niemi		The present linguistic analyses of two children (aged 8 and 10) with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and their two matched controls are based on dyadic therapist-child conversations and on picture description tasks. The circa 100 analysis features covering aspects of (i) lexicon (e.g. prominalization), (ii) structural characteristics of turns, (iii) co-operation features (e.g. shared/non-shared elaboration of themes), (iv) prosody, (v) cognitive aspects (e.g. involvement/commitment, world of discourse) and (vi) affect features, show that the AS speakers describe, rather than narrate their conceptualizations, whether (practically) self-initiated (dyadic discourse) or prompted through pictures (narratives). In previous experimental studies of spatially deictic expressions and spatial orientation, it has been shown that the spatial and low-level social cognition of these AS subjects was unimpaired. However, in the present study AS discourse carries features of impaired inter-personal and inter-subjective performance, manifest, for example, in linguistic deixis, atypical power-oriented features and lack of joint activity.
20956837		Physical fitness and physical activity in adolescents with asperger syndrome: a comparative study.	Adapted physical activity quarterly : APAQ	2010	Erwin Borremans, Pauli Rintala, Jeffrey A McCubbin		While physical activity is beneficial for youth with developmental disabilities, little is known about those individuals' fitness profile and levels of activity. Therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate the physical fitness profile and physical activity level of 30 adolescents with and without Asperger syndrome (AS). Evaluations were done using the Eurofit physical fitness test and the Baecke Habitual Physical Activity questionnaire. A 2 x 2 MANOVA indicated that adolescents with AS scored significantly lower than the comparison group on all physical fitness subtests, including balance, coordination, flexibility, muscular strength, running speed, and cardio-respiratory endurance (p < .001). Adolescents with AS were also less physically active (p < .001). Engagement in physical activities is therefore recommended.

20952166	doi: 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.007	Maturation of limbic regions in Asperger syndrome: a preliminary study using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and structural magnetic resonance imaging.	Psychiatry research	2010	Finian M O'Brien, Lisa Page, Ruth L O'Gorman, Patrick Bolton, Ajay Sharma, Gillian Baird, Eileen Daly, Brian Hallahan, Ronán M Conroy, Catherine Foy, Sarah Curran, Dene Robertson, Kieran C Murphy, Declan G M Murphy		People with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD, including Asperger syndrome) may have developmental abnormalities in the amygdala-hippocampal complex (AHC). However, in vivo, age-related comparisons of both volume and neuronal integrity of the AHC have not yet been carried out in people with Asperger syndrome (AS) versus controls. We compared structure and metabolic activity of the right AHC of 22 individuals with AS and 22 healthy controls aged 10-50 years and examined the effects of age between groups. We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) to measure the volume of the AHC, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) to measure concentrations of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine+phosphocreatine (Cr+PCr), myo-inositol (mI) and choline (Cho). The bulk volume of the amygdala and the hippocampus did not differ significantly between groups, but there was a significant difference in the effect of age on the hippocampus in controls. Compared with controls, young (but not older) people with AS had a significantly higher AHC concentration of NAA and a significantly higher NAA/Cr ratio. People with AS, but not controls, had a significant age-related reduction in NAA and the NAA/Cr ratio. Also, in people with AS, but not controls, there was a significant relationship between concentrations of choline and age so that choline concentrations reduced with age. We therefore suggest that people with AS have significant differences in neuronal and lipid membrane integrity and maturation of the AHC.
20934986	doi: 10.1093/scan/nsq088	Exploring the building blocks of social cognition: spontaneous agency perception and visual perspective taking in autism.	Social cognitive and affective neuroscience	2011	Jan Zwickel, Sarah J White, Devorah Coniston, Atsushi Senju, Uta Frith		Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have highly characteristic impairments in social interaction and this is true also for those with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (AS). These social cognitive impairments are far from global and it seems likely that some of the building blocks of social cognition are intact. In our first experiment, we investigated whether high functioning adults who also had a diagnosis of AS would be similar to control participants in terms of their eye movements when watching animated triangles in short movies that normally evoke mentalizing. They were. Our second experiment using the same movies, tested whether both groups would spontaneously adopt the visuo-spatial perspective of a triangle protagonist. They did. At the same time autistic participants differed in their verbal accounts of the story line underlying the movies, confirming their specific difficulties in on-line mentalizing. In spite of this difficulty, two basic building blocks of social cognition appear to be intact: spontaneous agency perception and spontaneous visual perspective taking.
20930927	pii: Doc03	Health-related quality of life in adolescents and young adults with high functioning autism-spectrum disorder.	Psycho-social medicine	2010	Inge Kamp-Becker, Johanna Schröder, Helmut Remschmidt, Christian J Bachmann		Over the last years, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has emerged as an important measure not only in somatic medicine but also in psychiatry. To date, there are only few reports on HRQOL in patients with autism-spectrum disorder (ASD). This study aimed at studying HRQOL in ASD patients with an IQ >70, using a self-report HRQOL questionnaire with cross-cultural validity.
20926459	doi: 10.1177/1362361310366569	Delayed video self-recognition in children with high functioning autism and Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Cheryl Dissanayake, Joh Shembrey, Thomas Suddendorf		Two studies are reported which investigate delayed video self-recognition (DSR) in children with autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder relative to one another and to their typically developing peers. A secondary aim was to establish whether DSR ability is dependent on metarepresentational ability. Children's verbal and affective responses to their image were also measured. Three groups of male children between 5 and 9 years, comprising 15 with high-functioning autistic disorder (HFA), 12 with Asperger's disorder (AspD), and 15 typically developing (TD) children, participated in Study 1. Study 2 included two groups of younger children (18 HFA; 18 TD) aged 4 to 7 years. Participant groups in each study were equally able to recognize themselves using delayed video feedback, and responded to their marked image with positive affect. This was so even amongst children with HFA who were impaired in their performance on false belief tasks, casting doubt on a metarepresentational basis of DSR.
20926053		[Sociophysiology: basic processes of empathy].	Neuropsychiatrie : Klinik, Diagnostik, Therapie und Rehabilitation : Organ der Gesellschaft Osterreichischer Nervenarzte und Psychiater	2010	Helene Haker, Jenny Schimansky, Wulf Rössler		The aim of this review is to describe sociophysiological and social cognitive processes that underlie the complex phenomenon of human empathy. Automatic reflexive processes such as physiological contagion and action mirroring are mediated by the mirror neuron system. They are a basis for further processing of social signals and a physiological link between two individuals. This link comprises simultaneous activation of shared motor representations. Shared representations lead implicitly via individual associations in the limbic and vegetative system to a shared affective state. These processes are called sociophysiology. Further controlled- reflective, self-referential processing of those social signals leads to explicit, conscious representations of others' minds. Those higher-order processes are called social cognition. The interaction of physiological and cognitive social processes lets arise the phenomenon of human empathy.
20923894	doi: 10.1177/1362361310371951	Early symptoms and recognition of pervasive developmental disorders in Germany.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Michele Noterdaeme, Anna Hutzelmeyer-Nickels		Pervasive developmental disorders are characterised by the presence of abnormalities in social interaction and communication as well as repetitive patterns of behaviours. Although early symptoms of the disorder often appear during the first two years of life, its diagnosis is often delayed. The purpose of this study is to analyse the delay between age at first symptoms and age at diagnosis as well as the characteristics of the first symptoms for the different subcategories of pervasive developmental disorders. The sample consists of 601 children with a diagnosis of a pervasive developmental disorder. Age at first symptoms, age at diagnosis and the type of the first problems are registered. The results show that children with autism show first symptoms at a mean age of 15 months whereas diagnosis is made at a mean age of 76 months. Children with Asperger's syndrome show first symptoms at a mean age of 26 months, while diagnosis is made at the mean age of 110 months. There is still a large delay between the age at which parents first report first symptoms and age at diagnosis. To improve early detection, systematic screening and training of primary care paediatricians should be implemented.
20923892	doi: 10.1177/1362361310372777	Recognizing faces based on inferred traits in autism spectrum disorders.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Rajani Ramachandran, Peter Mitchell, Danielle Ropar		Recent findings indicate that individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) could, surprisingly, infer traits from behavioural descriptions. Now we need to know whether or not individuals with ASD are able to use trait information to identify people by their faces. In this study participants with and without ASD were presented with pairs of faces each accompanied by a sentence. One sentence allowed a trait to be inferred (e.g. 'This is Ross who smiled and said hello to everyone at the party.') and one allowed a fact to be inferred (e.g. 'This is Ben who has to bend down to enter most doors.'). Subsequently, the same face stimuli were presented with a single descriptive trait, fact or name cue (e.g. friendly or tall and Ross or Ben respectively in the above examples). Participants had to choose which of the faces best related to the cue word. Participants with ASD performed surprisingly well in associating traits, facts, and names to the appropriate person significantly above what would be expected by chance. Indeed, they performed as well as participants without ASD.
20923890	doi: 10.1177/1362361309353613	Socio-dramatic affective-relational intervention for adolescents with asperger syndrome & high functioning autism: pilot study.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Matthew D Lerner, Amori Yee Mikami, Karen Levine		This study examined the effectiveness of a novel intervention called 'socio-dramatic affective-relational intervention' (SDARI), intended to improve social skills among adolescents with Asperger syndrome and high functioning autism diagnoses. SDARI adapts dramatic training activities to focus on in vivo practice of areas of social skill deficit among this population. SDARI was administered as a six-week summer program in a community human service agency. Nine SDARI participants and eight age- and diagnosis-group matched adolescents not receiving SDARI were compared on child- and parent-report of social functioning at three week intervals beginning six weeks prior to intervention and ending six weeks post-intervention. Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) was used to estimate growth trends between groups to assess treatment outcomes and post-treatment maintenance. Results indicated significant improvement and post-treatment maintenance among SDARI participants on several measures of child social functioning. Implications for practice and research are discussed.
20923887	doi: 10.1177/1362361309353614	Risk factors for autism and Asperger syndrome. Perinatal factors and migration.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2011	Nils G S Haglund, Karin B M Källén		Using the Swedish Medical Birth Registry (MBR), obstetrical and demographic information was retrieved for 250 children with autism or Asperger syndrome who were born in Malmoe, Sweden, and enrolled at the local Child and Youth Habilitation Center. The reference group consisted of all children born in Malmoe during 1980-2005. Obstetric sub-optimality (prematurity, low Apgar scores, growth restriction, or macrosomia) was positively associated with autism but not with Asperger syndrome. Maternal birth outside the Nordic countries was positively associated with autism (adjusted OR: 2.2; 95%CI: 1.6-3.1) and negatively associated with Asperger syndrome (OR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.3-0.97). The highest risk estimate for autism was found among children to women who were born in sub-Saharan Africa (OR: 7.3), or in East Asia (OR: 3.4).
20877532		Behavioral Therapy with an Individual with Asperger's Disorder.	Psychiatry (Edgmont (Pa. : Township))	2010	Kelly Blankenship, Noha F Minshawi		"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders have deficits in communication, social interactions, and emotional regulation and exhibit repetitive behaviors. These individuals can become very reactive to their environment and at times may engage in emotional outbursts. The social deficits seen in autism spectrum disorders are in part caused by the difficulty these individuals have with modulating their own anger and interpreting their own emotions and those of people around them. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders tend to learn and process visual information more effectively than auditory information. Thus, visual supports can help individuals with autism spectrum disorders process information more effectively. This article discusses the use of one particular visual support, an ""emotions thermometer,"" in helping instruct individuals with autism spectrum disorders on recognizing and modulating their own emotions. The article also discusses anger management techniques that can be utilized once individuals have begun to recognize more subtle signs of irritability within themselves."
20877284	doi: 10.1038/mp.2010.102	Sex-specific serum biomarker patterns in adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Molecular psychiatry	2011	E Schwarz, P C Guest, H Rahmoune, L Wang, Y Levin, E Ingudomnukul, L Ruta, L Kent, M Spain, S Baron-Cohen, S Bahn		Autism spectrum conditions have been hypothesized to be an exaggeration of normal male low-empathizing and high-systemizing behaviors. We tested this hypothesis at the molecular level by performing comprehensive multi-analyte profiling of blood serum from adult subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS) compared with controls. This led to identification of distinct sex-specific biomarker fingerprints for male and female subjects. Males with AS showed altered levels of 24 biomarkers including increased levels of cytokines and other inflammatory molecules. Multivariate statistical classification of males using this panel of 24 biomarkers revealed a marked separation between AS and controls with a sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.88. Testing this same panel in females did not result in a separation between the AS and control groups. In contrast, AS females showed altered levels of 17 biomarkers including growth factors and hormones such as androgens, growth hormone and insulin-related molecules. Classification of females using this biomarker panel resulted in a separation between AS and controls with sensitivities and specificities of 0.96 and 0.83, respectively, and testing this same panel in the male group did not result in a separation between the AS and control groups. The finding of elevated testosterone in AS females confirmed predictions from the 'extreme male brain' and androgen theories of autism spectrum conditions. We conclude that to understand the etiology and development of autism spectrum conditions, stratification by sex is essential.
20862532	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-1106-8	Local information processing in adults with high functioning autism and asperger syndrome: the usefulness of neuropsychological tests and self-reports.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Annelies A Spek, Evert M Scholte, Ina A Van Berckelaer-Onnes		Local information processing in 42 adults with high functioning autism, 41 adults with Asperger syndrome and 41 neurotypical adults was examined. Contrary to our expectations, the disorder groups did not outperform the neurotypical group in the neuropsychological measures of local information processing. In line with our hypotheses, the self-reports did show higher levels of local information processing and a stronger tendency to use systemizing strategies in the two disorder groups. Absent and weak correlations were found between the self-reports and the two neuropsychological tasks in the three groups. The neuropsychological tests and the self-reports seem to measure different underlying constructs. The self-reports were most predictive of the presence of an autism spectrum diagnosis.
20858470	doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.09.047	Parent-assisted group treatment for friendship problems of children with autism spectrum disorders.	Brain research	2011	Fred Frankel, Cynthia Whitham		Children with Asperger's Disorder or High Functioning Autism are included in regular education classes but find themselves excluded from the social lives of their classmates. This paper briefly reviews studies which attempt to provide them with training to overcome their social difficulties. These interventions have had limited success and have not systematically incorporated the child's parents into the intervention. Children's Friendship Training is a manualized parent-assisted group treatment which teaches social skill through learning and practicing sets of rules of etiquette for key social situations. The treatment approach has been demonstrated to have success in improving friendships of children with autism spectrum disorders. The content of Children's Friendship Training is briefly described and results of controlled studies are reviewed. Limitations of previous research and future directions are also described.

Der Nervenarzt	2011	T Fangmeier, A Lichtblau, J Peters, M Biscaldi-Schäfer, D Ebert, L T van Elst		There is an increase in awareness in professionals that the Asperger syndrome (AS) in adulthood is associated with specific problems and burdens which may well differ from those in childhood and adolescence. The core symptoms of AS generally persist into adulthood, however in contrast to childhood and adolescence there is no specific support system for adults in Germany. Also the environment of the afflicted patient changes thus producing different challenges and problems. In addition a subgroup of patients with high functioning AS primarily presents in adulthood generally due to secondary psychosocial problems, depression or anxiety. Difficulties in social interaction, problems with modified daily routines and unforeseen situations cause severe frustration for the majority of the patients. While several therapy programs have been developed and implemented for children and adolescents, for adults there are none. Also there is a lack of comprehensive concepts addressing the specific needs of adult patients with AS. From an economic perspective this is particularly unfortunate since affected people often have good or excellent partial abilities and might be very valuable employees. In this article existing therapeutic concepts for AS are summarized and a newly designed group therapy program for adult patients with Asperger syndrome in Freiburg is introduced (Freiburg Asperger-spezifische Therapie für Erwachsene, FASTER) which specifically addresses the needs and problems of adult patients with AS.
20855904	doi: 10.1177/0956797610383435	How magic changes our expectations about autism.	Psychological science	2010	Gustav Kuhn, Anastasia Kourkoulou, Susan R Leekam		"In the vanishing-ball illusion, the magician's social cues misdirect the audience's expectations and attention so that the audience ""sees"" a ball vanish in the air. Because individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are less sensitive to social cues and have superior perception for nonsocial details compared with typically developing individuals, we predicted that they would be less susceptible to the illusion. Surprisingly, the opposite result was found, as individuals with ASD were more susceptible to the illusion than a comparison group. Eye-tracking data indicated that subtle temporal delays in allocating attention might explain their heightened susceptibility. Additionally, although individuals with ASD showed typical patterns of looking to the magician's face and eyes, they were slower to launch their first saccade to the face and had difficulty in fixating the fast-moving observable ball. Considered together, the results indicate that individuals with ASD have difficulties in rapidly allocating attention toward both people and moving objects."
20853022	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-1101-0	Differential olfactory identification in children with autism and Asperger's disorder: a comparative and longitudinal study.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Tamara May, Warrick J Brewer, Nicole J Rinehart, Peter G Enticott, Avril V Brereton, Bruce J Tonge		Key theories of autism implicate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) compromise, while olfactory identification (OI) deficits are associated with OFC dysfunction. This study aimed to complete a 5-year follow-up of children with high-functioning autism (HFA) who previously lacked the normal age-OI association; and compare unirhinal-OI in children with HFA, Asperger's disorder (ASP), and controls. While both HFA and controls had improved birhinal-OI at follow-up, reduced OI in some HFA participants suggested OFC deterioration and heterogeneous OFC development. Unirhinal-OI was impaired in HFA but not ASP relative to controls, suggesting orbitofrontal compromise in HFA but integrity in ASP. Differing IQ-OI relationships existed between HFA and ASP. Findings support the hypothesis of separate neurobiological underpinnings in ASP and HFA, specifically differential orbitofrontal functioning.

Thalamic volume in all ASD subgroups was significantly smaller compared with volume in the control subjects.
20848330	doi: 10.1007/s11940-010-0091-8	Pharmacologic treatment of behavioral symptoms associated with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders.	Current treatment options in neurology	2010	Logan K Wink, Craig A Erickson, Christopher J McDougle		Pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), including autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD NOS), are neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood onset. These disorders persist throughout the lifespan of affected individuals and are characterized by impaired social behavior and communication, along with repetitive, stereotypic behaviors. Early diagnosis and subsequent behavioral therapy have been shown to improve outcomes for these individuals. Risperidone and aripiprazole have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of irritability associated with autism in children and adolescents. Despite their efficacy, use of these medications is limited by their side effects. In individuals with severe irritability, the first-line treatment is often risperidone. Because of its relatively lower risk of weight gain and metabolic side effects, aripiprazole may be used initially if there is a personal or family history of obesity or diabetes. Monitoring of body mass index and metabolic profiles is indicated with both medications. Stereotypic behaviors associated with autism, though clearly driven by neurobiologic processes, can also be understood as coping mechanisms used to decrease anxiety. From this perspective, therapies targeting reduction of these symptoms may be contraindicated. However, when these symptoms are severe and interfering, pharmacotherapy may be necessary. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors are of limited efficacy in children and adolescents, but risperidone and aripiprazole have been shown to reduce these symptoms. There remains a need for further safety and efficacy research in this area. Hyperactivity and inattention are currently treated with a variety of medications, including guanfacine, which has a relatively benign side effect profile. Stimulant medications are generally avoided as first-line treatment for hyperactivity because of concerns about increased irritability. Currently, social impairment is best addressed through behavioral therapy and social skills training. Novel pharmacotherapies to improve social impairment are in the early stages of research.
20844308		[Autism spectrum disorders--recent advances in the research on the impairment in social communication].	Brain and nerve = Shinkei kenkyu no shinpo	2010	Nobumasa Kato, Hidenori Yamasue, Keiichiro Watanabe, Seiichiro Jinde, Miyuki Sadamatsu		Since the discovery of early infantile autism (1943), the etiology of the disease has for long been a matter of dispute-from a form of innate schizophrenia, maltreatment by 'refrigerator mother', to dysfunction of speech development. After the re-discovery of Asperger syndrome by Wing (1981), the concept of this diverse syndrome complex has merged to pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) or autism spectrum disorders (ASD). People suffering from Asperger syndrome do not show impairments in speech development, in fact, they have good linguistic abilities. They can explain their own psychopathology, which helps in the understanding of classical autism with profound mental retardation. Currently, ASD is prevalent in 1 of 150 births with strong genetic inheritance. ASD is therefore thought a psychiatric common disease. Asperger syndrome has frequently been the subject of neuroimaging studies,since social communication is an important characteristic of human behavior. This review encompasses a historical and clinical overview of ASD and puts force the current perspectives on the researches in animal models,genetic studies of animal and human samples,and neuroimaging studies. Our current focus is the possible role of oxytocin,which was recently found to have an effect on empathy,in the etiology of ASD.
20841342	doi: 10.1177/1362361310368407	Judgements of self-understanding in adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Barbara Marie Dritschel, Mary Wisely, Lorna Goddard, Sally Robinson, Pat Howlin		Previous research has demonstrated that adults with high functioning autism (HFA)/Asperger syndrome (AS) judge others as having as much knowledge about their inner mental states as they do. The current study examined whether this pattern also applies to adolescents with HFA/AS because typically developing adolescents, in contrast to younger children, regard themselves as experts on their own inner states. Twenty-two adolescents with HFA/AS and 22 controls judged how much they versus a comparison person knew about 6 aspects of their inner states. In contrast to typically developing adolescents, those with HFA/AS judged the comparison person as having more knowledge about themselves than they did. This study suggests that adolescents with HFA/AS have more pronounced difficulties with this aspect of self-knowledge than do adults with this condition. The implications of this deficit for social functioning are discussed.

Clinical psychology & psychotherapy	2010	Jonathan A Weiss, Yona Lunsky		Individuals with Asperger syndrome are at increased risk for mental health problems compared with the general population, especially with regard to mood and anxiety disorders. Generic mental health services are often ill-equipped to offer psychotherapeutic treatments to this population, and specialized supports are difficult to find. This case series used a manualized cognitive behaviour therapy group programme (Mind Over Mood) with three adults diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, who were each unable to access psychotherapy through mainstream mental health services. This review highlights the benefits of a cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) group approach for adults with Asperger syndrome and suggests some potential modifications to traditional CBT provision. 
20826075	doi: 10.1016/j.braindev.2010.08.010	Correlation between EEG abnormalities and symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).	Brain & development	2010	Akihiro Yasuhara	Yasuhara Children's Clinic and YCC Education Center, Japan. akihiro-yasuhara@car.ocn.ne.jp	Children with ASD often suffer from epilepsy and paroxysmal EEG abnormality. Purposes of this study are the confirmation of incidence of epileptic seizures and EEG abnormalities in children with autism using a high performance digital EEG, to examine the nature of EEG abnormalities such as locus or modality, and to determine if the development of children with ASD, who have experienced developmental delay, improves when their epilepsy has been treated and maintained under control. A total of 1014 autistic children that have been treated and followed-up for more than 3 years at Yasuhara Children's Clinic in Osaka, Japan, were included in this study. Each participant's EEG had been recorded approximately every 6 months under sleep conditions. Epilepsy was diagnosed in 37% (375/1014) of the study participants. Almost all patients diagnosed with epilepsy presented with symptomatic epilepsy. The data showed that the participants with lower IQ had a higher incidence of epileptic seizures. Epileptic EEG discharges occurred in 85.8% (870/1014) of the patients. There was also a very high incidence of spike discharges in participants whose intellectual quotient was very low or low. Epileptic seizure waves most frequently developed from the frontal lobe (65.6%), including the front pole (Fp1 and Fp2), frontal part (F3, F4, F7 and F8) and central part (C3, Cz and C4). The occurrence rate of spike discharges in other locations, including temporal lobe (T3, T4, T5, T6), parietal lobe (P3, Pz, P4), occipital lobe (O1, O2) and multifocal spikes was less than 10%. These results support the notion that there is a relationship between ASD and dysfunction of the mirror neuron system. The management of seizure waves in children diagnosed with ASD may result in improves function and reduction of autistic symptoms.

Children with AS often experience social and organizational difficulties spanning daily occupations. This case study explored the pattern of Global Strategies and Domain-Specific Strategies (DSS) use, the type of guidance, and dimensions of time on task used by two children with AS (aged 10 and 12 years) in addressing social and organizational goals during the CO-OP intervention. Coding of the videotaped CO-OP sessions suggested that both children (a) utilized all the Global strategies, particularly ""understanding the context” and ""plan""; (b) used six common DSS, namely transitional supports, affective supports, attending, task-specification, task modification, and supplementing task knowledge, with task-specification being most prominent; (c) required minimal guidance while ""doing""; and (d) engaged in considerable time ""talking about the task.” The results provide initial insights into strategies that may enable children with AS to achieve social and organizational goals."

Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry	2010	Ali Emre Sevik, Ebru Cengel Kültür, Hilal Demirel, Kader Karlı Oğuz, Onur Akça, Eser Lay Ergün, Başaran Demir		Some patients with pervasive developmental disorders develop unusual talents, which are characterized as savant syndrome. Herein we present neuropsychological examination and brain imaging (fMRI and brain SPECT) findings of an 18-year-old male with Asperger syndrome and highly unusual calendar memory. Neuropsychological evaluation of the case indicated mild attention, memory, and problem solving deficits, and severe executive function deficits that included conceptualization, category formation, and abstraction. Functional MRI findings showed activation above the baseline level (P<0.05) in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, superior and middle frontal gyri, and medial frontal cortex. Brain SPECT findings, in comparison to rest-SPECT findings, showed that there was hypoperfusion in some brain regions, including the right frontal cortex and right parietal cortex. Baseline blood perfusion in the left frontal cortex was also observed, as well as hypoperfusion in the right parietal-occipital cortex and in the right basal ganglion (compared to the left side). The results of the present study and further research will contribute to our understanding of calendar memory and savant syndrome.
20816758	doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.08.091	Abnormal cell patterning at the cortical gray-white matter boundary in autism spectrum disorders.	Brain research	2010	Thomas A Avino, Jeffrey J Hutsler		"Previous research on neuronal spacing and columnar organization indicates the presence of cell patterning alterations within the cerebral cortex of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These patterning abnormalities include irregularities at the gray-white matter boundary and may implicate early neurodevelopmental events such as migration in altering cortical organization in ASD. The present study utilized a novel method to quantify the gray-white matter boundary in eight ASD and eight typically developing control subjects. Digital photomicrographs of the gray-white matter boundary were acquired from multiple positions within the superior temporal gyrus (BA21), dorsolateral frontal lobe (BA9), and dorsal parietal lobe (BA7) of each case. A sigmoid curve was fitted to the transition zone between layer VI and underlying white matter (subplate), and the slope of the resulting curve was used as a measure of the spatial extent of the transition zone. For all three cortical regions examined, ASD subjects showed ""shallower"" sigmoid curves compared to neurotypicals, indicating the presence of an indistinct boundary between cortical layer VI and the underlying white matter. These results may reflect the presence of supernumerary neurons beneath the cortical plate that could be the result of migration deficits or failed apoptosis in the subplate region. Furthermore, these findings raise questions regarding the validity of cortical measures that rely on gray-white matter parcellation, since an indistinct transition zone could lead to a misplaced cortical boundary and errors in both thickness and volume measures."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Robert C Butler, Jennifer M Gillis		"Currently, there is a paucity of literature on stigmatization of adults with Asperger's Disorder (AD). Therefore, this study examined whether young adults hold stigmatizing views towards individuals with AD and if that stigmatization is elicited by behaviors or labels. College students (N = 195) read one of six vignettes. A modified Social Distance Scale (Link et al. 1987) was used to assess stigmatization. A 2 × 3 analysis of variance revealed that the social behaviors commonly observed in AD significantly impacted stigmatization scores, while the label, ""Asperger's Disorder,"" did not. These findings have important implications for future research, educating the public, providing support services, and treatment recommendations for individuals with AD."

Functional analyses indicated that elopement was maintained by access to attention in the resource room and obtaining a preferred activity in the classroom. Attention- and tangible-based interventions were compared in an alternating treatments design in both settings. Results validated the findings of the functional analyses. Implications for the assessment and treatment of elopement are discussed.

In two separate studies, participants were employed to assist in the delivery of a fire safety education program. Participants were asked to wear an inflatable firefighter WalkAround® mascot costume and to perform 63 scripted behaviors in coordination with a fire prevention specialist who was the lead program presenter. In Study 1, three participants were initially exposed to established company training procedures comprised of behavioral skills training components to determine whether they met mastery of the skills. If necessary to reach criteria, participants were then exposed to a performance cue system. In Study 2, three additional participants were provided with the performance cue system alone, and then behavioral skills training if required. A single case, multiple-baseline design across subjects was used to evaluate efficacy of each intervention. Results indicate that 5 of 6 participants reached criterion only after introduction of the cue system while the sixth reached criterion with behavioral skills training alone. The program received high satisfaction ratings from participants, their parents, and consumers. Implications and potential use of the PCS in other employment settings are discussed."

Three-hundred and forty-five children participated in this study in 5 groups; NLD, AS, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Combined type, ADHD: Inattentive type, and controls. The NLD group showed particular difficulty on visual-spatial, visual-motor, and fluid reasoning measures compared to the other groups. There was also a significant verbal-performance IQ split in this group related to difficulty in social functioning. This study extends the findings from previous studies and extends these findings to differences between AS and NLD groups.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Michal Hrdlicka, Jan Vodicka, Marketa Havlovicova, Tomas Urbanek, Marek Blatny, Iva Dudova		The aim of our study was to explore possible differences in estimation of odor pleasantness in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) compared to controls. Thirty-five patients with Asperger's syndrome and high functioning autism (mean age 10.8 ± 3.6 years; 31 boys) were compared with 35 healthy control subjects (mean age 10.4 ± 2.4 years; 28 boys). Odor pleasantness was assessed on a 5-point scale using the Sniffin' Sticks test (Identification part of the test). Patients with ASD, compared to healthy controls, perceived the smell of cinnamon and pineapple as significantly less pleasant (p < 0.05); at the trend level, the same was true of cloves (p < 0.1). The possibility of olfactory dysfunctions as an autism biomarker is discussed.

Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior	2010	Anne Castles, Alison Crichton, Margot Prior		We report two cases of developmental hyperlexia - JY and AD - who performed at normal levels or above in converting print into speech, but who were very impaired in spoken and written word comprehension. Our investigations focussed on whether these cases displayed evidence for normal acquisition of lexical reading skills, as indexed by unimpaired performance for age in reading aloud a set of irregular words, despite poor acquisition of semantic knowledge of the same words. In both cases, this dissociation was evident. The pattern of results was also demonstrated at an item level: the two cases showed no significant differences in reading accuracy for irregular words which they could define than for those which they could not. The results provide further evidence for the existence of a direct-lexical route from orthography to phonology, which is not necessarily mediated by semantic knowledge.
20675739	doi: 10.1136/jme.2010.036459	Asperger syndrome and the supposed obligation not to bring disabled lives into the world.	Journal of medical ethics	2010	Pat Walsh	Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, School of Law, King's College London, Strand, London, UK. patricia.walsh@kcl.ac.uk	Asperger syndrome (AS) is an autistic spectrum condition that shares the range of social impairments associated with classic autism widely regarded as disabling, while also often giving rise to high levels of ability in areas such as maths, science, engineering and music. The nature of this striking duality of disability and ability is examined, along with its implications for our thinking about disability and the relevance of levels and kinds of disability to reproductive choices. In particular, it may be seen as posing a challenge to John Harris's influential position in reproductive ethics relating to disability. The paper argues that if, as Harris maintains, there is a quite general moral obligation to avoid bringing disabled lives into the world regardless of the level of disability, then AS must be seen as having a strong claim to be exempt from such an obligation. However, a broader critique of Harris's position leads to the conclusion that, in fact, this putative obligation does not exist.

Occupational therapy international	2010	Sharon A Gutman, Emily I Raphael, Leila M Ceder, Arshi Khan, Katherine M Timp, Sabrina Salvant		The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of a motor-based, social skills intervention for two adolescents with high-functioning autism (HFA) using single-subject design. A description of the intervention is provided as a first step in the manualization process. The intervention was provided as a 7-week after-school program, once weekly to the paired participants. Intervention consisted of role-play methods in which motor behaviours were linked with their cognitive and emotional meanings. Baseline, intervention and 3-month probe data collection periods were carried out and then compared using visual inspection of graphed data, paired t-tests and a three-standard-deviation-band approach. Both participants displayed a statistically significant increase in targeted social skills behaviours from baseline to intervention and maintained this level at a 3-month post-intervention probe. These single-subject design cases illustrate that motor-based, social skills interventions may be effective for adolescents with HFA and warrant further testing.

Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry	2010	Sandra Babić, Dragana Mutavdzić Pavlović, Danijela Asperger, Martina Perisa, Mirta Zrncić, Alka J M Horvat, Marija Kastelan-Macan		An analytical method for multi-class pharmaceuticals determination in wastewater has been developed and validated. Target compounds were: sulfonamides (sulfadiazine, sulfaguanidine, sulfamethazine, sulfamethoxazole), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, norfloxacin), diaminopyrimidine (trimethoprim), anaesthetic (procaine), anthelmintic (praziquantel and febantel), and macrolide (roxithromycin). The method involves pre-concentration and clean-up by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using Strata-X extraction cartridges at pH 4.0. Target analytes were identified and quantitatively determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Recoveries were higher than 50% with relative standard deviation (RSD) below 18.3% for three concentrations. Only for sulfaguanidine was low recovery obtained. Matrix effect was evaluated using matrix-matched standards. The method detection limit (MDL) was between 0.5 and 5 ng L(-1) in spiked water samples. The precision of the method, calculated as relative standard deviation, ranged from 0.5 to 2.0% and from 1.4 to 8.3 for intra-day and inter-day analysis, respectively. The described analytical method was used for determination of pharmaceuticals in effluent wastewaters from the pharmaceutical industry.
20661767	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-1071-2	Teasing, ridiculing and the relation to the fear of being laughed at in individuals with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Andrea C Samson, Oswald Huber, Willibald Ruch		The present paper investigated the fear of being laughed at (gelotophobia) in relation to recalled experiences of having been laughed at in the past in individuals with Asperger's Syndrome (AS). About 45% of the individuals with AS (N = 40), but only 6% of the controls (N = 83) had at least a slight form of gelotophobia, which is the highest percentage ever found in the literature. Gelotophobia correlated with the frequency and severity of remembered teasing and mocking situations in the past. This indicates that gelotophobia is an important issue in individuals with AS. Furthermore, individuals with AS are less able to laugh at themselves (gelotophilia), but enjoy laughing at others (katagelasticism, a more hostile form of humor) to the same extent as controls do.
20650368	doi: 10.1016/j.apnu.2009.07.004	Beyond the roadblocks: transitioning to adulthood with Asperger's disorder.	Archives of psychiatric nursing	2010	Diane H Lawrence, Delores A Alleckson, Pamela Bjorklund		Growing up with Asperger's disorder is complex and fraught with difficulty. Although the literature includes some research related to the transition of youth with Asperger's disorder to school and employment, none pertains to the transition to adulthood and independent living. Although a marginal number of young adults with Asperger's disorder eventually achieve independence, many of them continue to depend on families for supportive services. Currently, health care organizations and social services lack coherent, integrated systems to assist youth with Asperger's disorder and their families with the out-of-home transition. To better facilitate the process, this article reviews the literature on Asperger's disorder, leading to a comprehensive, evidence-based transition assessment guide framed by A. Maslow's (1972) hierarchy of needs.

20628629		Abnormal auditory forward masking pattern in the brainstem response of individuals with Asperger syndrome.	Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment	2010	Johan Källstrand, Olle Olsson, Sara Fristedt Nehlstedt, Mia Ling Sköld, Sören Nielzén		Abnormal auditory information processing has been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In the present study auditory processing was investigated by recording auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) elicited by forward masking in adults diagnosed with Asperger syndrome (AS). Sixteen AS subjects were included in the forward masking experiment and compared to three control groups consisting of healthy individuals (n = 16), schizophrenic patients (n = 16) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder patients (n = 16), respectively, of matching age and gender. The results showed that the AS subjects exhibited abnormally low activity in the early part of their ABRs that distinctly separated them from the three control groups. Specifically, wave III amplitudes were significantly lower in the AS group than for all the control groups in the forward masking condition (P < 0.005), which was not the case in the baseline condition. Thus, electrophysiological measurements of ABRs to complex sound stimuli (eg, forward masking) may lead to a better understanding of the underlying neurophysiology of AS. Future studies may further point to specific ABR characteristics in AS individuals that separate them from individuals diagnosed with other neurodevelopmental diseases.

20621443	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.06.012	Moebius sequence and autism spectrum disorders--less frequently associated than formerly thought.	Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Wolfgang Briegel, Martina Schimek, Inge Kamp-Becker		Moebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. It is questionable, whether there is a strong association of the sequence with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) as suggested in some earlier case reports and studies. Twenty-two participants with Möbius sequence aged 6-16 years followed a request of the German Moebius foundation to participate in a nationwide study. All patients had a physical examination and intelligence testing. Primary caregivers were asked to complete two screening measures of ASD (Behaviour and Communication Questionnaire, VSK; Marburger Asperger's Syndrome Rating Scale, MBAS). For those who reached the cut-off for ASD and/or showed behavioural aspects indicative of ASDs during IQ testing and/or physical examination, well standardized diagnostic instruments (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and Kinder-DIPS) were administered. Minimal diagnostic criteria for Möbius sequence were congenital facial weakness (uni- or bilateral) and impairment of ocular abduction (uni- or bilateral). Three boys (one of them mentally retarded) out of 22 participants (12 males and 10 females) were found suspicious of ASD by screening, but none of them fulfilled diagnostic criteria of ASD on a clinical consensus conference. Therefore, ASDs seem to be not as frequent as reported in previous studies on patients with Möbius sequence.

This clinical term was treated very differently according to which explanatory model was adopted. Nowadays, it is used to refer to developmental coordination disorder in view of its neuro-developmental origin. In any case, the actual clinical situations vary and are often complex. In our opinion, it is first necessary to examine the differential diagnosis: apraxia in children caused by lesions, dysgraphia, simply delayed motor development, non-verbal learning disability syndrome, hemispheric specialisation deficits, pervasive developmental disorders (autisms, Asperger syndrome, atypical autism and other pervasive developmental disorders), mixed specific developmental disorders, multiple developmental disorder, and children with high potential. Next we focus on co-morbidity. Firstly, we look at psychopathological disorders associated with dyspraxia: autism and pervasive developmental disorders, dyscalculia/math disability, dyslexia/reading difficulties, dysphasia accompanied by verbal dyspraxia, intelligence deficiency, anxiety disorders, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Secondly, we examine psychopathological disorders associated with dyspraxia. Children with developmental coordination disorder are less inclined to participate in collective games. As a result, there is a greater risk of them becoming lonely and isolated. They have higher child behaviour checklist (CBCL) scores in the somatic problems scale as well as for anxiety, depression and social withdrawal. They have low self-perception in sports as well as at school, which is related to their physical appearance and their self-esteem, attention deficit and externalized behaviour. These children are often at risk of academic failure and they suffer from oppositional defiant disorder and functional disorders. And finally, we believe that it is important to touch on the impact of these disorders on the family."

NeuroImage	2010	Marcel P Zwiers	Donders Institute for Brain, Cognition and Behaviour, Radboud University Nijmegen, HB Nijmegen, The Netherlands. m.zwiers@donders.ru.nl	Motion artefacts are an important but often disregarded problem in diffusion-weighted imaging, which can readily lead to corrupt diffusion model estimations. The new processing method proposed in this paper uses robust tensor estimation that is spatially informed to efficiently detect the most frequently occurring artefacts, namely those that result from head and cardiac motion. Simulations demonstrate that the method is more robust and accurate than previous methods. The tensor estimates are more accurate in motion artefact-free conditions, less sensitive to increases in artefact magnitude and more resistant to increasing artefact frequency. Evaluation with real diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging data shows that the method works excellently, even for datasets with a high degree of motion that otherwise need to be discarded. The method is not limited to diffusion tensor imaging but also yields objective artefact reflecting weights that can be used to inform subsequent processing or estimation of higher-order diffusion models.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Megan Norris, Luc Lecavalier		The goal of this review was to examine the state of Level 2, caregiver-completed rating scales for the screening of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) in individuals above the age of three years. We focused on screening accuracy and paid particular attention to comparison groups. Inclusion criteria required that scales be developed post ICD-10, be ASD-specific, and have published evidence of diagnostic validity in peer-reviewed journals. The five scales reviewed were: the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), Gilliam Autism Rating Scale/Gilliam Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (GARS/GARS-2), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), and Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS). Twenty total studies were located, most examining the SCQ. Research on the other scales was limited. Comparisons between scales were few and available evidence of diagnostic validity is scarce for certain subpopulations (e.g., lower functioning individuals, PDDNOS). Overall, the SCQ performed well, the SRS and ASSQ showed promise, and the GARS/GARS-2 and ASDS demonstrated poor sensitivity. This review indicates that Level 2 ASD caregiver-completed rating scales are in need of much more scientific scrutiny.

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2010	Christine M Falter, Kate C Plaisted Grant, Greg Davis		A pervasive integration deficit could provide a powerful and elegant account of cognitive processing in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, in the case of visual Gestalt grouping, typically assessed by tasks that require participants explicitly to introspect on their own grouping perception, clear evidence for such a deficit remains elusive. To resolve this issue, we adopt an index of Gestalt grouping from the object-based attention literature that does not require participants to assess their own grouping perception. Children with ASD and mental- and chronological-age matched typically developing children (TD) performed speeded orientation discriminations of two diagonal lines. The lines were superimposed on circles that were either grouped together or segmented on the basis of color, proximity or these two dimensions in competition. The magnitude of performance benefits evident for grouped circles, relative to ungrouped circles, provided an index of grouping under various conditions. Children with ASD showed comparable grouping by proximity to the TD group, but reduced grouping by similarity. ASD seems characterized by a selective bias away from grouping by similarity combined with typical levels of grouping by proximity, rather than by a pervasive integration deficit.

Langenbeck's archives of surgery	2010			Internal rectal prolapse and rectocele are frequent clinical findings in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS). However, there is still no evidence whether stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR) provides a safe and effective surgical option. Therefore, the German STARR registry was initiated to assess safety, effectiveness, and quality of life.
20542048	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.06.003	Exceptions and anomalies: an ERP study on context sensitivity in autism.	Neuropsychologia	2010	Judith Pijnacker, Bart Geurts, Michiel van Lambalgen, Jan Buitelaar, Peter Hagoort		Several studies have demonstrated that people with ASD and intact language skills still have problems processing linguistic information in context. Given this evidence for reduced sensitivity to linguistic context, the question arises how contextual information is actually processed by people with ASD. In this study, we used event-related brain potentials (ERPs) to examine context sensitivity in high-functioning adults with autistic disorder (HFA) and Asperger syndrome at two levels: at the level of sentence processing and at the level of solving reasoning problems. We found that sentence context as well as reasoning context had an immediate ERP effect in adults with Asperger syndrome, as in matched controls. Both groups showed a typical N400 effect and a late positive component for the sentence conditions, and a sustained negativity for the reasoning conditions. In contrast, the HFA group demonstrated neither an N400 effect nor a sustained negativity. However, the HFA group showed a late positive component which was larger for semantically anomalous sentences than congruent sentences. Because sentence context had a modulating effect in a later phase, semantic integration is perhaps less automatic in HFA, and presumably more elaborate processes are needed to arrive at a sentence interpretation.
20537859	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.04.010	Adults with autism spectrum disorders and ADHD neuropsychological aspects.	Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Agneta Nydén, Lena Niklasson, Ola Stahlberg, Henrik Anckarsater, Elisabet Wentz, Maria Rastam, Christopher Gillberg		The purpose of the present study was to assess which types of neuropsychological deficits appear to be most commonly associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults. The effect of the combination of ASD with ADHD (ASD/ADHD) was also studied. One hundred and sixty-one adult individuals (≥18 years of age) were included in the study. None had full scale IQ less than 71. The neuropsychological investigations included measures of intellectual ability, learning and memory, attention/executive function and theory of mind. The three diagnostic groups showed reduced performance in most cognitive domains. However, within these domains differentiating distinct features could be seen. The dysfunctions of the ASD/ADHD group cannot be seen as a summary of the dysfunctions found in the ASD and ADHD groups. The ADHD seemed to have the most severe neuropsychological impairments of the three groups. No domain-specific deficit typical of any of the diagnostic groups was found.

Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology	2010	Simone G Shamay-Tsoory, Ella Gev, Judith Aharon-Peretz, Noga Adler		"The role of brain asymmetry in emotional processing in Asperger syndrome (AS) is still largely unknown. Although the valence hypothesis predicts that positive emotions are processed preferentially by the left hemisphere and negative emotions by the right hemisphere, reports concerning laterality of emotion point to a left hemisphere advantage for complex emotion versus a right hemisphere advantage for basic emotions (the ""type hypothesis""). In this study, we investigated the lateralization of basic versus complex (negative and positive) eye expressions in adults with AS in 2 consecutive experiments: in the first experiment, the performance of AS and healthy controls were compared in a divided visual field task. In the second experiment, the ability of participants with AS to identify eye expressions varying in valence and type was compared with that of patients with localized lesions in either the right or the left hemispheres. Controls were better in recognizing negative emotions presented to the left visual field and positive emotions presented to the right visual field, whereas individuals with AS failed to show this interaction effect. Lateralization of basic versus complex emotions was less evident although indeed controls identified better basic emotions presented to the right visual field. Furthermore, participants with AS exhibited a similar pattern of recognition of negative versus positive emotions to that of patients with left hemisphere damage. It is suggested that the pattern of performance of individuals with AS resembles that of patients with left hemisphere dysfunction."
20533450	doi: 10.1002/aur.137	Comparison of visual sensitivity to human and object motion in autism spectrum disorder.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2010	Martha D Kaiser, Lara Delmolino, James W Tanaka, Maggie Shiffrar		Successful social behavior requires the accurate detection of other people's movements. Consistent with this, typical observers demonstrate enhanced visual sensitivity to human movement relative to equally complex, nonhuman movement [e.g., Pinto & Shiffrar, 2009]. A psychophysical study investigated visual sensitivity to human motion relative to object motion in observers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants viewed point-light depictions of a moving person and, for comparison, a moving tractor and discriminated between coherent and scrambled versions of these stimuli in unmasked and masked displays. There were three groups of participants: young adults with ASD, typically developing young adults, and typically developing children. Across masking conditions, typical observers showed enhanced visual sensitivity to human movement while observers in the ASD group did not. Because the human body is an inherently social stimulus, this result is consistent with social brain theories [e.g., Pelphrey & Carter, 2008; Schultz, 2005] and suggests that the visual systems of individuals with ASD may not be tuned for the detection of socially relevant information such as the presence of another person. Reduced visual sensitivity to human movements could compromise important social behaviors including, for example, gesture comprehension.
20528049	doi: 10.1037/a0018335	WISC-III index score profiles of 520 Swedish children with pervasive developmental disorders.	Psychological assessment	2010	Eric Zander, Sven Olof Dahlgren		WISC-III (Wechsler, 1991) index score profiles and their characteristics were examined with traditional statistics in a large Swedish sample consisting of children with autistic disorder (n = 85), Asperger's disorder (n = 341), or pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; n = 94). There was a clear and significant difference in level between children with Asperger's disorder, who performed in the average range according to the Swedish standardization, and children with either autistic disorder or PDD-NOS, who performed below the average range (almost 2 standard deviations below the mean), but few other differences between the diagnostic groups were found. The variation in this sample, compared with the Swedish standardization, was generally larger in regard to the size of standard deviations and to the proportion of individuals who exhibited significant differences between indices. The result implied that a WISC-III profile could not be used to discriminate between the different PDDs.
20516059	doi: 10.1177/1359104509355019	The clinical practice of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for children and young people with a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome.	Clinical child psychology and psychiatry	2011	Kate Donoghue, Paul Stallard, Joanna Kucia		Children and young people diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) have significant social-communication difficulties and impaired empathy and theory of mind skills. These difficulties place them at risk of developing mental health problems, particularly anxiety, depression and obsessive compulsive disorder. Although Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is recognised as an effective intervention for these problems in both child and adult populations, little research has specifically looked at the use of CBT with children and young people with an AS diagnosis. However, limited evidence suggests that CBT, if suitably adapted, is a feasible and potentially helpful treatment option. This paper focuses on the clinical practice of CBT and explores how the underpinning therapeutic relationship can be modified to meet the cognitive needs of this particular group of young clients.

20489230	doi: 10.1109/TPAMI.2009.107	Classification of complex information: inference of co-occurring affective states from their expressions in speech.	IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence	2010	Tal Sobol-Shikler, Peter Robinson		We present a classification algorithm for inferring affective states (emotions, mental states, attitudes, and the like) from their nonverbal expressions in speech. It is based on the observations that affective states can occur simultaneously and different sets of vocal features, such as intonation and speech rate, distinguish between nonverbal expressions of different affective states. The input to the inference system was a large set of vocal features and metrics that were extracted from each utterance. The classification algorithm conducted independent pairwise comparisons between nine affective-state groups. The classifier used various subsets of metrics of the vocal features and various classification algorithms for different pairs of affective-state groups. Average classification accuracy of the 36 pairwise machines was 75 percent, using 10-fold cross validation. The comparison results were consolidated into a single ranked list of the nine affective-state groups. This list was the output of the system and represented the inferred combination of co-occurring affective states for the analyzed utterance. The inference accuracy of the combined machine was 83 percent. The system automatically characterized over 500 affective state concepts from the Mind Reading database. The inference of co-occurring affective states was validated by comparing the inferred combinations to the lexical definitions of the labels of the analyzed sentences. The distinguishing capabilities of the system were comparable to human performance.

Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Mårten Eriksson, Monica Westerlund, Carmela Miniscalco		"This study discusses six common methodological limitations in screening for language delay (LD) as illustrated in 11 recent studies. The limitations are (1) whether the studies define a target population, (2) whether the recruitment procedure is unbiased, (3) attrition, (4) verification bias, (5) small sample size and (6) inconsistencies in choice of ""gold standard"". It is suggested that failures to specify a target population, high attrition (both at screening and in succeeding validation), small sample sizes and verification bias in validations are often caused by a misguided focus on screen positives (SPs). Other limitations are results of conflicting methodological goals. We identified three such conflicts. One consists of a dilemma between unbiased recruitment and attrition, another between the comprehensiveness of the applied gold standard and sample size in validation and the third between the specificity of the gold standard and the risk of not identifying co-morbid conditions."

20470188	doi: 10.1517/14728214.2010.487860	Emerging drugs for the treatment of symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders.	Expert opinion on emerging drugs	2010	Logan K Wink, Martin H Plawecki, Craig A Erickson, Kimberly A Stigler, Christopher J McDougle		Autism spectrum disorders, or pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), are neurodevelopmental disorders defined by qualitative impairment in social interaction, impaired communication and stereotyped patterns of behavior. The most common forms of PDD are autistic disorder (autism), Asperger's disorder and PDD not otherwise specified. Recent surveillance studies reveal an increase in the prevalence of autism and related PDDs. The use of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of these disorders can reduce the impact of interfering symptoms, providing relief for affected individuals and their families.
20461452	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-1023-x	The inclusion of siblings in social skills training groups for boys with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2011	Lia L Castorina, Lisa M Negri		This pilot investigation evaluated the effectiveness of siblings as generalisation agents in an 8-week social skills training (SST) program designed for boys with Asperger syndrome (AS). Twenty-one boys aged 8-12 participated in a SST group alone, with a sibling, or remained in a wait-list control group. After training, participants' identification of non-verbal social cues significantly improved and was maintained at 3-month follow-up, irrespective of sibling involvement. Similar trends existed for participants' ability to accurately interpret emotions relative to controls. Improvements did not extend to parent and teacher ratings on standardised social skills measures, suggesting poor generalisation, or questionable sensitivity of measures to taught skills. Results suggest some promise in improving social skills training for children with AS.

Here, we show that ToM abilities could be predicted by levels of AM in HFA and AS as compared to controls, suggesting that difficulties in AM are closely related to ToM impairments in HFA and AS.
20451347	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.04.004	Basic reading skills in Swedish children with late developing language and with or without autism spectrum disorder or ADHD.	Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Carmela Miniscalco, Annika Dahlgren Sandberg		Reading skills at age 7-8 years were examined in a community-representative sample of 21 screened and clinically examined children with language delay (LD) followed prospectively from 2.5 years of age. The present study aimed to (1) determine whether these children with a history of LD had deficits in basic reading skills, i.e. decoding and comprehension, compared to the age norms of standardized tests, (2) analyze if there was a relationship between reading outcome and neuropsychiatric diagnosis by comparing three subgroups of children, LD pure, LD+ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and LD+ADHD, and, (3) determine what language measures at age 6 years were associated with the 7-8-year reading outcome. Both decoding and comprehension of single word reading were significantly below the norm for the whole LD group, where children with LD+ASD scored lowest, and children with LD highest. However, the differences between the three groups did not reach significance. Two reader groups were identified according to the results of word decoding and comprehension, respectively, resulting in the same 7 children. ANOVA revealed that the only differences on the 6-year language tests between the two groups were found on color naming and word memory. This study has shown that children with LD and subsequently identified neurodevelopmental problems such as ASD and ADHD experience continued deficits, demonstrated also in reading skills and that the picture of the reading problems seemed to resemble those of typically developing children.

Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2010	David M Snyder, Karen Miller, Martin T Stein		"CASE 1: At 3 years of age, Billy was seen by his pediatrician for a well child visit. Spontaneous speech was limited during the visit. He did not interact with the pediatrician and attempts to play with Billy resulted in oppositional behavior. About 3 months after the visit, Billy's parents requested a developmental evaluation; he was diagnosed with autism by means of an observational measure and a parent interview. Billy was born full term after an uncomplicated labor, delivery and postnatal period. Motor milestones were normal. His parents recalled that he used his finger to point to an object prior to using words. He spoke several single words by his first birthday and used phrases before age 2 years. Billy was described as often having difficulty with transitions, but he is happy and outgoing in familiar situations. At 3 years old, when he started preschool, Billy did not speak to either the teacher or other children. This pattern of refusal to speak persists. His parents report that he talks to them and one uncle using complete sentences with clear speech. Billy prefers to repeat activities and is reluctant to try activities. He frequently plays with the same toy cars placing them in a neat line and becomes upset if things are not done in the same way. An uncle has Asperger syndrome. CASE 2: Juan, a 3 year old Mexican-American boy, was referred by his preschool teacher because ""he does not interact with other children or use language at an age-appropriate level."" He prefers to play alone, resists participation in group activities at preschool, and does not share as well as other students according to his teacher. Expressive language with speech is rarely seen in preschool. In contrast, at home he plays interactively, shares toys with his older brother and speaks in short, clear sentences. In preschool, English is spoken exclusively. At home, Spanish is the primary language. Prenatal and birth histories were uneventful. Motor and social milestones were achieved art the expected times. He spoke his first word at 18 months and 2-word phrases at 2 years. Currently, he speaks in full sentences with pleurals and pronouns. He follows commands and recently had a normal audiogram. His parents, who speak English with ease, are concerned about the teacher's observations at school. The physical examination was normal; the developmental and behavioral assessments were conducted by an English speaking clinician. Juan played interactively with toys while demonstrating curiosity, showing and joint attention. There was no speech production during a 30 minute period although he did follow directions. When a Spanish speaking clinician assumed responsibility for the assessment, Juan's speech production increased significantly. He told a story about his drawing and talked about the family dog and his brother. He had good eye contact and appropriate pragmatic speech when the dialogue was in Spanish."

20436772		Selective mutism: a review of etiology, comorbidities, and treatment.	Psychiatry (Edgmont (Pa. : Township))	2010	Priscilla Wong	Dr. Wong is from the Department of Pediatrics, Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, Washington.	Selective mutism is a rare and multidimensional childhood disorder that typically affects children entering school age. It is characterized by the persistent failure to speak in select social settings despite possessing the ability to speak and speak comfortably in more familiar settings. Many theories attempt to explain the etiology of selective mutism.Comorbidities and treatment. Selective mutism can present a variety of comorbidities including enuresis, encopresis, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, premorbid speech and language abnormalities, developmental delay, and Asperger's disorders. The specific manifestations and severity of these comorbidities vary based on the individual. Given the multidimensional manifestations of selective mutism, treatment options are similarly diverse. They include individual behavioral therapy, family therapy, and psychotherapy with antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications.Future directions. While studies have helped to elucidate the phenomenology of selective mutism, limitations and gaps in knowledge still persist. In particular, the literature on selective mutism consists primarily of small sample populations and case reports. Future research aims to develop an increasingly integrated, multidimensional framework for evaluating and treating children with selective mutism.

20433857	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.04.020	Enhanced pure-tone pitch discrimination among persons with autism but not Asperger syndrome.	Neuropsychologia	2010	Anna Bonnel, Stephen McAdams, Bennett Smith, Claude Berthiaume, Armando Bertone, Valter Ciocca, Jacob A Burack, Laurent Mottron		Persons with Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) display atypical perceptual processing in visual and auditory tasks. In vision, Bertone, Mottron, Jelenic, and Faubert (2005) found that enhanced and diminished visual processing is linked to the level of neural complexity required to process stimuli, as proposed in the neural complexity hypothesis. Based on these findings, Samson, Mottron, Jemel, Belin, and Ciocca (2006) proposed to extend the neural complexity hypothesis to the auditory modality. They hypothesized that persons with ASD should display enhanced performance for simple tones that are processed in primary auditory cortical regions, but diminished performance for complex tones that require additional processing in associative auditory regions, in comparison to typically developing individuals. To assess this hypothesis, we designed four auditory discrimination experiments targeting pitch, non-vocal and vocal timbre, and loudness. Stimuli consisted of spectro-temporally simple and complex tones. The participants were adolescents and young adults with autism, Asperger syndrome, and typical developmental histories, all with IQs in the normal range. Consistent with the neural complexity hypothesis and enhanced perceptual functioning model of ASD (Mottron, Dawson, Soulières, Hubert, & Burack, 2006), the participants with autism, but not with Asperger syndrome, displayed enhanced pitch discrimination for simple tones. However, no discrimination-thresholds differences were found between the participants with ASD and the typically developing persons across spectrally and temporally complex conditions. These findings indicate that enhanced pure-tone pitch discrimination may be a cognitive correlate of speech-delay among persons with ASD. However, auditory discrimination among this group does not appear to be directly contingent on the spectro-temporal complexity of the stimuli.
20427233	doi: 10.1016/j.sleep.2009.10.003	Cyclic alternating pattern: A window into pediatric sleep.	Sleep medicine	2010	Oliviero Bruni, Luana Novelli, Silvia Miano, Liborio Parrino, Mario Giovanni Terzano, Raffaele Ferri		Cyclic alternating pattern (CAP) has now been studied in different age groups of normal infants and children, and it is clear that it shows dramatic changes with age. In this review we first focus on the important age-related changes of CAP from birth to peripubertal age and, subsequently, we describe the numerous studies on CAP in developmental clinical conditions such as pediatric sleep disordered breathing, disorders of arousal (sleep walking and sleep terror), pediatric narcolepsy, learning disabilities with mental retardation (fragile-X syndrome, Down syndrome, autistic spectrum disorder, Prader-Willi syndrome) or without (dyslexia, Asperger syndrome, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). CAP rate is almost always decreased in these conditions with the exception of the disorders of arousal and some cases of sleep apnea. Another constant result is the reduction of A1 subtypes, probably in relationship with the degree of cognitive impairment. The analysis of CAP in pediatric sleep allows a better understanding of the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of sleep disturbance. CAP can be considered as a window into pediatric sleep, allowing a new vision on how the sleeping brain is influenced by a specific pathology or how sleep protecting mechanisms try to counteract internal or external disturbing events.

20413799	doi: 10.1177/0883073810368311	Cortical gyrification in autistic and Asperger disorders: a preliminary magnetic resonance imaging study.	Journal of child neurology	2010	Roger J Jou, Nancy J Minshew, Matcheri S Keshavan, Antonio Y Hardan		The validity of Asperger disorder as a distinct syndrome from autism is unclear partly because of the paucity of differentiating neurobiological evidence. Frontal lobe cortical folding between these disorders was compared using the gyrification index. Twenty-three boys underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging: 6 with high-functioning autism, 9 with Asperger disorder, and 8 controls. Using the first coronal slice anterior to the corpus callosum, total and outer cortical contours were traced to calculate the gyrification index. This index was also calculated for superior and inferior regions to examine dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices, respectively. Analysis of variance revealed differences in the left inferior gyrification index, which was higher in the autism group compared with Asperger and control groups. There were no differences in age, intelligence quotient, and brain volume. These preliminary findings suggest that cortical folding may be abnormally high in the frontal lobe in autism but not Asperger disorder, suggesting distinct frontal lobe neuropathology.

20409644	doi: 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.03.009	Children with high-functioning autism show a normal cortisol awakening response (CAR).	Psychoneuroendocrinology	2010	Katharina Zinke, Eva Fries, Matthias Kliegel, Clemens Kirschbaum, Lucia Dettenborn		Individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFA) show difficulties in the ability to react to change. A recent study suggested that variations in the functioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, especially in one of its markers--the cortisol awakening response (CAR)--may be related to those difficulties in adolescents with Asperger's syndrome. The current study investigated the CAR in a younger sample with diagnoses from the whole autism spectrum: A group of children with HFA (N=15) was compared to a group of typically developing children (N=25). Findings suggest that the frequency of a CAR as well as the increase in cortisol levels from awakening to 30 min later were similar between groups, indicating that variations in the CAR in HFA may not be present early in life but only develop later in adolescence or may only occur in some diagnoses from the autism spectrum.
20395282	doi: 10.1177/1362361309354757	Parents' criticisms and attributions about their adult children with high functioning autism or schizophrenia.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Stephanie Wasserman, Amy Weisman de Mamani, Peter Mundy		The current study examined the criticism component of expressed emotion (EE) and attributions in parents of adults diagnosed with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (S/SA) or high functioning autism/Asperger's. Consistent with study hypotheses, parents of adults diagnosed with autism/Asperger's disorder exhibited lower levels of high EE-criticism than parents of adults diagnosed with S/SA. Moderate trends suggested that parents of adults diagnosed with autism/Asperger's disorder tended to make less blameworthy attributions towards patients than did parents of adults diagnosed with S/SA. A content analysis of parents' causal attributions was also conducted.The most common cause cited by both groups of parents was biological factors, suggesting that parents may be becoming more aware of scientific findings implicating biological factors, in conjunction with psychosocial factors, as a major cause of mental illness.

20392782	doi: 10.1177/1362361309344849	Recognising 'social' and 'non-social' emotions in self and others: a study of autism.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	David Williams, Francesca Happé		Studies of emotion processing in autism have produced mixed results, with fewer studies observing autism-specific deficits than might be imagined. In the current study, 21 individuals with autism and 21 age- and ability-matched, learning disabled comparison participants were tested for their ability to (a) recognise, in others, expressions of 'social' emotions (e.g., embarrassment) and 'non-social' emotions (e.g., happiness) and; (b) report their own previous experiences of each of these emotions. In line with predictions, amongst both groups of participants, social emotions were more difficult to recognise and report than non-social emotions. Also amongst both groups, the ability to report social emotion-experience was significantly associated with the ability to recognise social emotions in others, independent of age and verbal ability. However, contrary to predictions, no between-group differences in levels or patterns of performance on the experimental tasks were observed. In light of previous research, these results suggest either that emotion-processing is not as specifically impaired in autism as is traditionally thought to be the case, or that individuals with autism are implementing compensatory strategies to succeed on experimental tasks in the absence of emotion-processing competence.

Auditory processing involves both hyper- and hypoactive reactivity to acoustic changes.
20380251		Phonetic and phonological errors in children with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome.	International journal of speech-language pathology	2010	Joanne Cleland, Fiona E Gibbon, Sue J E Peppé, Anne O'Hare, Marion Rutherford		This study involved a qualitative analysis of speech errors in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Participants were 69 children aged 5-13 years; 30 had high functioning autism and 39 had Asperger syndrome. On a standardized test of articulation, the minority (12%) of participants presented with standard scores below the normal range, indicating a speech delay/disorder. Although all the other children had standard scores within the normal range, a sizeable proportion (33% of those with normal standard scores) presented with a small number of errors. Overall 41% of the group produced at least some speech errors. The speech of children with ASD was characterized by mainly developmental phonological processes (gliding, cluster reduction and final consonant deletion most frequently), but non-developmental error types (such as phoneme specific nasal emission and initial consonant deletion) were found both in children identified as performing below the normal range in the standardized speech test and in those who performed within the normal range. Non-developmental distortions occurred relatively frequently in the children with ASD and previous studies of adolescents and adults with ASDs shows similar errors, suggesting that they do not resolve over time. Whether or not speech disorders are related specifically to ASD, their presence adds an additional communication and social barrier and should be diagnosed and treated as early as possible in individual children.

20359737	doi: 10.1016/j.bandl.2010.03.002	Semantic integration during metaphor comprehension in Asperger syndrome.	Brain and language	2010	Rinat Gold, Miriam Faust, Abraham Goldstein		Previous research indicates severe disabilities in processing figurative language in people diagnosed on the autism spectrum disorders. However, this aspect of language comprehension in Asperger syndrome (AS) specifically has rarely been the subject of formal study. The present study aimed to examine the possibility that in addition to their pragmatic deficits, the difficulties in the comprehension of metaphors in AS may be explained by deficient linguistic information processing. Specifically, we aimed to examine whether a deficient semantic integration process underlies the difficulties in metaphor comprehension frequently experienced by persons with AS. The semantic integration process of sixteen AS participants and sixteen matched controls was examined using event related potentials (ERPs). N400 amplitude served as an index for degree of effort invested in the semantic integration process of two-word expressions denoting literal, conventional metaphoric, and novel metaphoric meaning, as well as unrelated word pairs. Large N400 amplitudes for both novel and conventional metaphors demonstrated the greater difficulties in metaphor comprehension in the AS participants as compared to controls. Findings suggest that differences in linguistic information processing cause difficulties in metaphor comprehension in AS.

20339839	doi: 10.1007/s00221-010-2217-3	Learning efficacy of explicit visuomotor sequences in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Asperger syndrome.	Experimental brain research	2010	Katsumi Watanabe, Hanako Ikeda, Masutomo Miyao		Developmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Asperger syndrome (AS) are often associated with learning disabilities. This study investigated the explicit learning of visuomotor sequences in 17 ADHD children (mean age 12.1), 21 AS children (mean age 12.7), and 15 typically developing children (mean age: 12.3). The participants were required to explore a hidden sequence of button presses by trial and error and elaborate the learned sequence (2 x 10 task: Hikosaka et al. 1996). The results indicated that although ADHD and AS children had a tendency of repeating the same errors and took longer to complete a sequence, both showed a degree and pattern of improvement in accuracy and speed similar to that of typically developing children. These results suggest that the explicit learning of visuomotor sequence in ADHD and AS patients is largely unimpaired.

Child development	2010	Angelica Ronald, Francesca Happé, Katharina Dworzynski, Patrick Bolton, Robert Plomin		Prenatal and neonatal events were reported by parents of 13,690 eighteen-month-old twins enrolled in the Twins Early Development Study, a representative community sample born in England and Wales. At ages 7-8, parents and teachers completed questionnaires on social and nonsocial autistic-like features and parents completed the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test. Correlations between prenatal and neonatal events and autistic-like features were weak, both in the whole sample (r = .00-.07) and at the 5% quantitative extreme (phenotypic group correlations = .01-.11), after controlling for socioeconomic status and cognitive ability. Neonatal problems showed modest heritability (13%-14%) and significant shared and nonshared environmental influences (55%-59% and 28%-31%, respectively). Differences in identical twins' neonatal problems correlated weakly with their difference scores on autistic-like features (r = .01-.06).

Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Elisabeth Fernell, Asa Hedvall, Fritiof Norrelgen, Mats Eriksson, Lotta Höglund-Carlsson, Martina Barnevik-Olsson, Liselotte Svensson, Annette Holm, Joakim Westerlund, Christopher Gillberg		"The aim was to characterize the panorama of developmental disorders in 208 preschool children with a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), referred to a specialized centre, the Autism Centre for Young Children (ACYC), for intervention. At the centre, a research team examined all children according to structured protocols and interviews. All available test data from their assessments prior to referral were scrutinized. The boy:girl ratio was 5.5:1. In 22% of the total group a period of regression, including speech and language, had occurred. Epilepsy had been diagnosed in 6% of the children. In 38% of the children there was a definite or highly suspected learning disability/mental retardation according to cognitive test results. About the same proportion had a developmental delay that at the time of assessment could not be definitely classified and in 23% there were clear indications of a normal intellectual function. About 40% of the group exhibited hyperactivity. Differences in expressive vocabulary and adaptive functioning were strongly related to cognitive level. About 20% of the group had AD as the dominating developmental disorder, i.e., they represented a clinical picture of ""classic"" autism. The majority in this group also had learning disability. Another 20%, had ASD combined with a normal intellectual level, some of these conformed to the clinical picture of Asperger syndrome. In a relatively large group (more than half) learning disability or a general developmental delay was as evident as the ASD. In a smaller group (8%) ASD criteria were questionably met. In this group attention deficits in connection with speech and language problems were prominent. The highly individual developmental profiles seen in children with ASDs have to be taken into account when planning intervention and follow-up. The children's medical characteristics also vary considerably and will be detailed in a further report."
20200852		[Alexithymia and Asperger syndrome].	Revista de neurologia	2010	I Paula-Pérez, J Martos-Pérez, M Llorente-Comí		The study starts with the hypothesis that the difficulty to identify and describe emotions and feelings, and to differentiate the feelings of bodily sensations that accompany them, are a common denominator of the construct of alexithymia and Asperger syndrome (AS).

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Efrosini Kalyva	Department of Psychology, City College, 24 Proxenou Koromila Street, 546 22 Thessaloniki, Greece. kalyva@city.academic.gr	Children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) who attend mainstream settings face social skills deficits that have not been adequately explored. This study aims to examine social skills through self-reports of children with AS (N = 21) and a matched group of typically developing peers, as well as reports from their mothers, fathers, and teachers. Results showed that children with AS had more social skills deficits according to all raters and that they reported more aggressiveness/antisocial behavior, more conceit/haughtiness, more loneliness/social anxiety, and less assertiveness than controls. The level of agreement between raters varied significantly, suggesting that social skills are best studied with multiple informants.
20195738	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0980-4	Punishment and sympathy judgments: is the quality of mercy strained in Asperger's syndrome?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Shelley Channon, Sian Fitzpatrick, Helena Drury, Isabelle Taylor, David Lagnado		This study examined reasoning about wrongdoing in people with Asperger's syndrome (AS) and matched healthy controls in relation to car accident scenarios. The two groups made similar judgments with respect to degree of driver negligence for both fines imposed and sympathy ratings. They also made similar judgments of fines in relation to the type of justification given for the drivers' actions. However, the AS group differentiated more in sympathy judgments relating to good and poor justifications. The AS group thus appeared to show preserved judgment with respect to compensation and sympathy for the victim and fines for the driver, but expressed less sympathy towards drivers with poor justifications for their actions.
20190638	doi: 10.1097/WNF.0b013e3181d6f7ad	Cholinergic abnormalities in autism: is there a rationale for selective nicotinic agonist interventions?	Clinical neuropharmacology	2010	Stephen I Deutsch, Maria R Urbano, Serina A Neumann, Jessica A Burket, Elionora Katz		"The core dysfunctions of autism spectrum disorders, which include autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, include deficits in socialization and communication and a need for the preservation of ""sameness;"" intellectual impairment and epilepsy are common comorbidities. Data suggest that pathological involvement of cholinergic nuclei and altered expression of acetylcholine receptors, particularly nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, occur in brain of persons with autistic disorder. However, many of these studies involved postmortem tissue from small samples of primarily adult persons. Thus, the findings may reflect compensatory changes and may relate more closely to intellectual impairment and the confounding effects of seizures and medications, as opposed to the core dysfunctions of autism. Nonetheless, because of the roles played by acetylcholine receptors in general, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in particular, in normal processes of attention, cognition, and memory, selective cholinergic interventions should be explored for possible therapeutic effects. Additionally, there are electrophysiological data that complement the clinical observations of frequent comorbid seizure disorders in these patients, suggesting a disturbance in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory tone in the brains of persons with autistic disorders. Conceivably, because the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is located on the surface of gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory neurons, selective stimulation of this receptor would promote gamma-aminobutyric acid's release and restore diminished inhibitory tone. The development of agonists and partial agonists for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and positive allosteric modulators that enhance the efficiency of coupling between the binding of agonist and channel opening should facilitate consideration of clinical trials."
20188512	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2010.01.012	The relationship between carers' report of autistic traits and clinical diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders in adults with intellectual disability.	Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Sabyasachi Bhaumik, Freya Tyrer, Mary Barrett, Nyunt Tin, Catherine W McGrother, Reza Kiani		It is often difficult to determine the triad of impairments and whether autistic features are the consequence of intellectual impairment or autism spectrum disorders in people with intellectual disability (ID). The aim of the current study was to investigate the relationship between carer-reported autistic traits and independent diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Data were collected on carers' subjective report of autistic traits and clinical diagnoses of ASD. Of 1145 adults with ID identified, 220 (19%) individuals had a diagnosis of ASD, and 778 (68%) individuals had at least one autistic trait. Optimal sensitivity and specificity were achieved with two or more autistic traits (sensitivity 63%; specificity 79%) and the positive predictive value increased substantially as the number of autistic traits increased. However, a significant proportion of individuals with ID who did not have a diagnosis of ASD also displayed autistic traits. Our findings suggest that in the absence of other measures, the presence of autistic traits can serve as a useful proxy measure for ASD in research (and/or clinical settings). However, although information on autistic traits may help healthcare practitioners to identify people with possible ASD, it cannot be used alone to make a formal diagnosis.

Most children who have Asperger's Syndrome (AS) are not identified until early school age, when social difficulties with other children become evident. Consequently, primary school teachers have an important role to play both in the recognition and management of the condition.
20181440	doi: 10.1016/j.patbio.2009.12.005	[Autism, genetics and synaptic function alterations].	Pathologie-biologie	2010	O Perche, F Laumonnier, L Baala, M-Y Ardourel, A Menuet, V Robin, S Mortaud, C Montécot-Dubourg, O Richard, J Pichon, S Briault		"Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a deficit of language and communication both associated with a restricted repertoire of activities and interests. The current prevalence of autistic disorder stricto sensu is estimated at 1/500 whereas autism spectrum disorders (ASD) increases up to 1/150 to 1/200. Mental deficiency (MD) and epilepsy are present in numerous autistic individuals. Consequently, autism is as a major public health issue. Autism was first considered as a non biological disease; however various rational approaches for analysing epidemiological data suggested the possibility of the influence of genetic factors. In 2003, this hypothesis was clearly illustrated by the characterization of genetic mutations transmitted through a mendelian manner. Subsequently, the glutamate synapse appeared as a preferential causal target in autism because the identified genes encoded proteins present in this structure. Strikingly, the findings that an identical genetic dysfunction of the synapse might also explain some MD suggested the possibility of a genetic comorbidity between these neurodevelopmental conditions. To date, various identified genes are considered indifferently as ""autism"" or ""MD"" genes. The characterization of mutations in the NLGN4X gene in patients with Asperger syndrome, autism without MD, or MD without autism, was the first example. It appears that a genetic continuum between ASD on one hand, and between autism and MD on the other hand, is present. Consequently, it is likely that genes already involved in MD will be found mutated in autistic patients and will represent future target for finding new factors in autism."

The level of functioning was estimated using the Children's Global Assessment Scale. The results support common (prevalence 74%) and often multiple comorbid psychiatric disorders in AS/HFA; behavioral disorders were shown in 44%, anxiety disorders in 42% and tic disorders in 26%. Oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders as comorbid conditions indicated significantly lower levels of functioning. To target interventions, routine evaluation of psychiatric comorbidity in subjects with AS/HFA is emphasized.

We present three families, in whom we identified intragenic rearrangements within NRXN1 using a clinical targeted oligonucleotide array CGH. An approximately 380 kb deletion was identified in a woman with Asperger syndrome, anxiety, and depression and in all four of her children affected with autism, anxiety, developmental delay, and speech delay but not in an unaffected child. An approximately 180 kb tandem duplication was found in a patient with autistic disorder and cognitive delays, and in his mother and younger brother who have speech delay. An approximately 330 kb tandem duplication was identified in a patient with autistic features. As predicted by conceptual translation, all three genomic rearrangements led to the premature truncation of NRXN1. Our data support previous observations that NRXN1 may be pathogenic in a wide variety of psychiatric diseases, including autism spectrum disorder, global developmental delay, anxiety, and depression.
20162344	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0959-1	Social competence intervention for youth with Asperger Syndrome and high-functioning autism: an initial investigation.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Janine P Stichter, Melissa J Herzog, Karen Visovsky, Carla Schmidt, Jena Randolph, Tia Schultz, Nicholas Gage		Individuals with high functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger Syndrome (AS) exhibit difficulties in the knowledge or correct performance of social skills. This subgroup's social difficulties appear to be associated with deficits in three social cognition processes: theory of mind, emotion recognition and executive functioning. The current study outlines the development and initial administration of the group-based Social Competence Intervention (SCI), which targeted these deficits using cognitive behavioral principles. Across 27 students age 11-14 with a HFA/AS diagnosis, results indicated significant improvement on parent reports of social skills and executive functioning. Participants evidenced significant growth on direct assessments measuring facial expression recognition, theory of mind and problem solving. SCI appears promising, however, larger samples and application in naturalistic settings are warranted.
20160081	doi: 10.1073/pnas.0910249107	Promoting social behavior with oxytocin in high-functioning autism spectrum disorders.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2010	Elissar Andari, Jean-René Duhamel, Tiziana Zalla, Evelyn Herbrecht, Marion Leboyer, Angela Sirigu		Social adaptation requires specific cognitive and emotional competences. Individuals with high-functioning autism or with Asperger syndrome cannot understand or engage in social situations despite preserved intellectual abilities. Recently, it has been suggested that oxytocin, a hormone known to promote mother-infant bonds, may be implicated in the social deficit of autism. We investigated the behavioral effects of oxytocin in 13 subjects with autism. In a simulated ball game where participants interacted with fictitious partners, we found that after oxytocin inhalation, patients exhibited stronger interactions with the most socially cooperative partner and reported enhanced feelings of trust and preference. Also, during free viewing of pictures of faces, oxytocin selectively increased patients' gazing time on the socially informative region of the face, namely the eyes. Thus, under oxytocin, patients respond more strongly to others and exhibit more appropriate social behavior and affect, suggesting a therapeutic potential of oxytocin through its action on a core dimension of autism.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Mohammad Ghaziuddin	University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0277, USA. mghaziud@umich.edu	The DSM IV defines Asperger syndrome (AS) as a pervasive developmental (autistic spectrum) disorder characterized by social deficits and rigid focused interests in the absence of language impairment and cognitive delay. Since its inclusion in the DSM-IV, there has been a dramatic increase in its recognition both in children and adults. However, because studies have generally failed to demonstrate a clear distinction between AS and autism, some researchers have called for its elimination from the forthcoming DSM V. This report argues for a modification of its diagnostic criteria and its continued retention in the diagnostic manual.
20143145	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0952-8	Parent, teacher, and self perceptions of psychosocial functioning in intellectually gifted children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Megan Foley Nicpon, Alissa F Doobay, Susan G Assouline		Parent, teacher, and self-perceptions of 54 high ability students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) were assessed through administration of the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children, Second Edition. Parent reports resulted in clinically elevated scores on the Atypicality, Attention Problems, Depression, Hyperactivity, Withdrawal, Activities of Daily Living, Adaptability, and Social Skills subscales, and teacher reports resulted in clinically elevated scores on the Atypicality, Depression, Withdrawal, and Adaptability subscales. Self-report scores were in the average range. Parents and teachers of adolescents reported greater adaptability and fewer symptoms of atypicality than parents and teachers of children. Psychosocial functioning appears impacted in high ability students with ASD and developmental differences in severity may exist.
20140638	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0951-9	Executive functioning in children with Asperger syndrome, ADHD-combined type, ADHD-predominately inattentive type, and controls.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Margaret Semrud-Clikeman, Jenifer Walkowiak, Alison Wilkinson, Brianne Butcher		The purpose of the study was to evaluate neuropsychological and behavioral rating measures of executive functions (EF) in children with two subtypes of ADHD, Asperger syndrome (AS), and controls. Relative to the control group, the clinical groups experienced more difficulty in EF. The AS group showed the most difficulty in emotional control, behavioral regulation, fluid reasoning, and planning compared to the ADHD groups. Number of symptoms of ADHD or AS was found to be significantly related to ratings of difficulty with behavior regulation, metacognition, and general behavioral regulation across the sample. These findings indicate that children with AS or ADHD may have a differing EF profile and thus, may respond differentially to interventions.
20128254		[Asperger's disorder diagnosed in the man treated with chronic and resistant emotional and behavioral disturbances--the case report].	Psychiatria polska	2009	Marcin Jabłoński, Paweł Sacha, Andrzej Grymek, Gabriela Ryczkowska		Asperger's disorder is a nosologic phenomena, that is similar to autism, and falls under the category of pervasive developmental disorders. The unknown and probably multi-factor aetiology, wide clinical picture and not completely defined and clinically relevant diagnostic criteria are the topic of discussion between investigators and clinicians. In the article presented, a single case report of a 39-year old male patient, diagnosed and treated for years due to chronic and resistant emotional and behavioural disturbances, not clearly defined psychotic symptoms and dominating dysfunctions of social involvement, may be a voice in the debate about Asperger's disorder spectrum, comorbidity in Asperger's syndrome and serve to remind the clinicians, that pervasive developmental disorders could really be diagnosed in adults.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Chien-Yu Pan	Department of Physical Education, National Kaohsiung Normal University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan. chpan@nknucc.nknu.edu.tw	The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a 10 week water exercise swimming program (WESP) on the aquatic skills and social behaviors of 16 boys with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In the first 10 week phase (phase I), eight children (group A) received the WESP while eight children (group B) did not. A second 10 week phase (phase II) immediately followed, with the treatments reversed. Both groups continued their regular treatment/ activity throughout the study. Improvements were seen in aquatic skills for both groups subsequent to the WESP. Following phase I, significant social improvements were seen in group A. Following phase II, social improvements were seen for group B, whereas group A merely maintained the improvements they attained through the implementation of the WESP during phase I. Results indicate that the WESP improved aquatic skills in the participants, and holds potential for social improvements.
20123027	doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.01.085	Smaller insula and inferior frontal volumes in young adults with pervasive developmental disorders.

However, little is known about brain volume abnormalities in young adults with PDD. We explored gray matter (GM) volume in young adults with PDD. T1-weighted volumetric images were acquired with a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner from 32 males with high-functioning PDD (23.8+/-4.2 years; Full Scale Intelligence Quotient [FSIQ]=101.6+/-15.6) and 40 age-matched normal male control subjects (22.5+/-4.3 years; FSIQ=109.7+/-7.9). Regional GM volumes were compared between the two groups using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL). Compared with the control group, the high-functioning PDD group showed significantly less GM in the right insula, the right inferior frontal gyrus, and the right inferior parietal lobule. A conservative threshold confirmed considerably smaller volumes in the right insula and inferior frontal gyrus. In these areas, negative correlations were found between Autism Spectrum Quotient scores and GM volume, although no significant correlations were found between each subject's FSIQ and GM volume. No regions showed greater GM volumes in the high-functioning PDD group. The insular cortex, which works as a relay area for multiple neurocognitive systems, may be one of the key regions underlying the complex clinical features of PDD. These smaller GM volumes in high-functioning PDD subjects may reflect the clinical features of PDD itself, rather than FSIQ.
20108114	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0947-5	Free classification as a window on executive functioning in autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Margaret McGonigle-Chalmers, Ben Alderson-Day		Spontaneous classification was assessed using a free serial search task in 18 school-aged children at the high functioning end of the autistic spectrum and compared with results from age-matched typically developing controls. The task required participants to touch shapes in an exhaustive non-repetitive sequence. The positions of the items varied randomly between touches. The objective was to measure the extent to which children with autism and Asperger's syndrome could spontaneously utilise category information such as shape and color to organise their search. There were no group differences on measures of sequential control and levels of categorization once age and IQ had been partialled out. The results are contrasted with findings from the same lab using a size seriation task.
20108031	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0943-9	Working memory in early-school-age children with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Jifang Cui, Dingguo Gao, Yinghe Chen, Xiaobing Zou, Ya Wang		Using a battery of working memory span tasks and n-back tasks, this study aimed to explore working memory functions in early-school-age children with Asperger's syndrome (AS). Twelve children with AS and 29 healthy children matched on age and IQ were recruited. Results showed: (a) children with AS performed better in digit and word recall tasks, but worse in block recall task and variant-visual-patterns test; (b) children with AS took longer time in most conditions of n-back tasks, and showed larger effects of task load. These findings indicated imbalance of working memory development in AS children: they had advantage in the phonological loop storing, but disadvantage in the visuospatial sketchpad storing, and partial deficit in central executive.
20093134	doi: 10.1016/j.physbeh.2010.01.003	Communication, interventions, and scientific advances in autism: a commentary.	Physiology & behavior	2010	Danielle C Llaneza, Susan V DeLuke, Myra Batista, Jacqueline N Crawley, Kristin V Christodulu, Cheryl A Frye		Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) affect approximately 1 in 150 children across the U.S., and are characterized by abnormal social actions, language difficulties, repetitive or restrictive behaviors, and special interests. ASD include autism (autistic disorder), Asperger Syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS or atypical autism). High-functioning individuals may communicate with moderate-to-high language skills, although difficulties in social skills may result in communication deficits. Low-functioning individuals may have severe deficiencies in language, resulting in poor communication between the individual and others. Behavioral intervention programs have been developed for ASD, and are frequently adjusted to accommodate specific individual needs. Many of these programs are school-based and aim to support the child in the development of their skills, for use outside the classroom with family and friends. Strides are being made in understanding the factors contributing to the development of ASD, particularly the genetic contributions that may underlie these disorders. Mutant mouse models provide powerful research tools to investigate the genetic factors associated with ASD and its co-morbid disorders. In support, the BTBR T+tf/J mouse strain incorporates ASD-like social and communication deficits and high levels of repetitive behaviors. This commentary briefly reviews the reciprocal relationship between observations made during evidence-based behavioral interventions of high- versus low-functioning children with ASD and the accumulating body of research in autism, including animal studies and basic research models. This reciprocity is one of the hallmarks of the scientific method, such that research may inform behavioral treatments, and observations made during treatment may inform subsequent research.
20087640	doi: 10.1007/s10803-010-0939-5	Categorical and dimensional structure of autism spectrum disorders: the nosologic validity of Asperger Syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Inge Kamp-Becker, Judith Smidt, Mardjan Ghahreman, Monika Heinzel-Gutenbrunner, Katja Becker, Helmut Remschmidt		There is an ongoing debate whether a differentiation of autistic subtypes, especially between Asperger Syndrome (AS) and high-functioning-autism (HFA) is possible and if so, whether it is a categorical or dimensional one. The aim of this study was to examine the possible clustering of responses in different symptom domains without making any assumption concerning diagnostic appreciation. About 140 children and adolescents, incorporating 52 with a diagnosis of AS, 44 with HFA, 8 with atypical autism and 36 with other diagnoses, were examined. Our study does not support the thesis that autistic disorders are discrete phenotypes. On the contrary, it provides evidence that e.g. AS and autism are not qualitatively distinct disorders, but rather different quantitative manifestations of the same disorder.

Journal of abnormal child psychology	2010	Margaret Semrud-Clikeman, Jenifer Walkowiak, Alison Wilkinson, Elizabeth Portman Minne		Understanding social interactions is crucial for development of social competence. The present study was one of the first to utilize direct and indirect measures of social perception to explore possible differences among children with nonverbal learning disability (NLD), Asperger's Syndrome (AS), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Combined (ADHD-C), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder-Predominately Inattentive (ADHD-PI), and controls (N = 342). Multiple informants provided ratings of the child's behavioral and social functioning. Results indicated that the NLD and AS groups experienced the most difficulty understanding emotional and nonverbal cues on the direct measure. In addition, children with AS or NLD showed significant signs of sadness and social withdrawal compared to the other groups. Attentional skills, while related to social perception, did not predict social perception difficulties to the same degree as number of AS symptoms.
20074449		Autism spectrum disorders and mastocytosis.	International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology	2009	Theoharis C Theoharides		Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are diagnosed in early childhood and include Autism, Asperger's disorder and Pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder--not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS, or atypical autism). ASD are associated with varying degrees of dysfunctional communication and social skills, repetitive and stereotypic behaviors, as well as attention and learning disabilities. Most ASD patients also have food intolerance and other allergic symptomatology indicative of mast cell activation. The number of ASD cases have increased over the last decade to 1/100, but there is no definite pathogenesis or curative therapy. We report that the apparent prevalence of ASD in patients with mastocytosis, a rare disease occurring in 1/4,000 children and characterized by an increased number of hypersensitive mast cells in many organs, is about 1/10 or 10 times higher than the general population. A child with skin mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa), and regressive autism is presented to illustrate the point. Allergic, infectious, neuroimmune and environmental triggers may activate mast cells to release vasoactive, inflammatory and neurotoxic molecules. These could disrupt the gut-blood-brain-barriers, and/or activate susceptibility genes, thus contributing to brain inflammation and ASD.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Eva Loth, Francesca Happé, Juan Carlos Gómez		This study used a novel rating task to investigate whether high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties distinguishing essential from variable aspects of familiar events. Participants read stories about everyday events and judged how often central, variable, and inappropriate event-components normally occur in this type of situation. The ASD boys made significantly more errors than the typically developing boys in rating the occurrences of variable aspects. In both groups, ratings of variable aspects were age-related, but in the ASD boys, they were also related to theory of mind and weak coherence test scores, and to severity of autistic symptoms. Implications for the understanding of some repetitive behaviours, such as the tendency to adhere to inflexible routines, are discussed.
20054629	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0930-1	Right hemisphere dysfunction and metaphor comprehension in young adults with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Rinat Gold, Miriam Faust		This study examined whether the known difficulties in metaphor comprehension exhibited by persons with Asperger syndrome (AS) can be explained by a dysfunctional right hemisphere (RH). Using the divided visual field paradigm, 27 AS participants and 36 matched controls were presented with word pairs of four types (literal, conventional metaphors, novel metaphors, and unrelated word pairs), and were asked to perform a semantic judgment task. The main hypothesis was that whereas the control group participants will show RH superiority for novel metaphor processing, no RH superiority will be found in the AS group. Results indeed indicate much less RH contribution to novel metaphor comprehension in AS, and are discussed in light of linguistic models and the neurobiology of autism.
20049633	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0923-0	'Autistic' local processing bias also found in children gifted in realistic drawing.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Jennifer E Drake, Amanda Redash, Katelyn Coleman, Jennifer Haimson, Ellen Winner		We investigated whether typically-developing children with a gift for drawing realistically show the local processing bias seen in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Twenty-seven 6-12 year-olds made an observational drawing (scored for level of realism) and completed three local processing tasks, and parents completed the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST). Drawing score predicted local processing performance on all tasks independently of verbal IQ, age, and years of art lessons. Drawing score also predicted more frequent repetitive behaviors as assessed by the CAST. Thus, skill in realistic drawing is associated with a strong local processing bias and a tendency towards repetitive behaviors, showing that traits found in individuals with ASD irrespective of artistic talent are also found in typically developing children with artistic talent.

Although previous studies have shown that the theory of mind (ToM) ability is impaired in Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and in schizophrenia, few controlled studies compared the ToM performance between the two disorders. Besides, the relationship between the degree of ToM impairment and symptom dimensions is unclear, and presence of ToM impairment in remitted patients with schizophrenia is controversial. Here, we tested the hypothesis that schizophrenia patients with prominent negative symptoms were closer to AS patients and different than schizophrenia patients without prominent negative symptoms and healthy controls in terms of ToM functioning.

An emergency laparotomy was performed. Multiple toy magnets and other metal objects were found, which were causing small bowel obstruction with interloop fistulation. Following removal and repair, the patient made an excellent recovery.

BMJ case reports	2010	Kazuhiro Tajima-Pozo, Diana Zambrano-Enriquez, Laura De Anta, Julie Zelmanova, Jose Luis De Dios Vega, Juan Jose Lopez-Ibor		The case of a 5-year-old child diagnosed as having pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), autistic type, from age 1 is reported. After surgery of vegetation in middle ear for repetitive otitis, the child presented an improvement in autistic behaviours, previously expressed as impaired social interactions, qualitative abnormalities in communication, a marked delay in language development, echolalia, stereotypies and self-aggressive behaviours. The aim of this paper is to bring attention to occurrences of misdiagnosis of PDD, which can occur when an adequate screening of the autistic syndrome is not realised. The result of the surgery was an improvement in autistic behaviours, despite the persistence of less severe autistic traits that may be more closely related to Asperger's syndrome.

Journal of separation science	2010	Dragana Mutavdzić Pavlović, Sandra Babić, Davor Dolar, Danijela Asperger, Kresimir Kosutić, Alka J M Horvat, Marija Kastelan-Macan		This paper focuses on the investigation of different types of SPE sorbents for the preconcentration of eight veterinary pharmaceuticals from water samples. The pharmaceuticals studied were sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine, sulfaguanidine, trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, enrofloxacin, norfloxacin and penicillin G/procaine. Five different SPE materials (Strata-X, Strata-X-C, Strata SDB-L, Strata C8 and Strata C18) from Phenomenex were compared with Oasis HLB with a view to obtaining the best cartridges for all pharmaceuticals investigated. Extraction efficiency was determined by HPLC with diode array detection (DAD). HPLC-DAD separation and quantification of the selected pharmaceuticals were carried out under gradient elution by a binary mixture of 0.01 M oxalic acid and ACN based on cyano modified column (LiChrosphere 100 CN) from Merck. Strata-X provided the best results in the preconcentration of 100 mL water samples, yielding average pharmaceutical recoveries of higher than 90%, except for sulfaguanidine (76.1%). The developed Strata-X-HLPC-DAD method was validated and applied, for the efficient investigation of reverse osmosis/nanofiltration membranes and for the removal of these eight pharmaceuticals from the production wastewater samples. NF90 and XLE membranes were shown to be the best for the rejection of all investigated pharmaceuticals.
20039110	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0928-8	Predicting friendship quality in autism spectrum disorders and typical development.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Nirit Bauminger, Marjorie Solomon, Sally J Rogers		The role played by social relationship variables (attachment security; mother-child relationship qualities) and social-cognitive capacities (theory of mind) was examined in both observed friendship behaviors and in children's descriptions of friendships (age 8-12) with high functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (HFASD) (n = 44) and with typical development (TYP) (n = 38). Overall, half of the HFASD sample (54.45%) reported maternal attachment security, corroborating data from younger children with ASD. The hypothesized predictors and their interrelations had both direct and indirect effects on friendship for both groups of children, highlighting the importance of these factors in children's friendship development and suggesting both compensatory and amplification mechanisms for friendship qualities. Practical and clinical implications are discussed for friendship support in both ASD and TYP.

His conclusion, echoing H.L.

The author also believes his own survival in life despite some ""ogres and tricksters"" along the way validates the Jungian philosophy of synchronicity. He believes that the storms of life are best weathered by accepting them as parts of a Merciful Providence's ""vast eternal plans"" for all His children on Earth."
20031980	doi: 10.1098/rsbl.2009.0897	Young children with autism spectrum disorder use predictive eye movements in action observation.	Biology letters	2010	Terje Falck-Ytter	Department of Psychology, Uppsala University, Box 1225, 751 42 Uppsala, Sweden. terje.falck-ytter@psyk.uu.se	Does a dysfunction in the mirror neuron system (MNS) underlie the social symptoms defining autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? Research suggests that the MNS matches observed actions to motor plans for similar actions, and that these motor plans include directions for predictive eye movements when observing goal-directed actions. Thus, one important question is whether children with ASD use predictive eye movements in action observation. Young children with ASD as well as typically developing children and adults were shown videos in which an actor performed object-directed actions (human agent condition). Children with ASD were also shown control videos showing objects moving by themselves (self-propelled condition). Gaze was measured using a corneal reflection technique. Children with ASD and typically developing individuals used strikingly similar goal-directed eye movements when observing others' actions in the human agent condition. Gaze was reactive in the self-propelled condition, suggesting that prediction is linked to seeing a hand-object interaction. This study does not support the view that ASD is characterized by a global dysfunction in the MNS.
20026140	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.12.023	When seeing depends on knowing: adults with Autism Spectrum Conditions show diminished top-down processes in the visual perception of degraded faces but not degraded objects.	Neuropsychologia	2010	Eva Loth, Juan Carlos Gómez, Francesca Happé		Behavioural, neuroimaging and neurophysiological approaches emphasise the active and constructive nature of visual perception, determined not solely by the environmental input, but modulated top-down by prior knowledge. For example, degraded images, which at first appear as meaningless 'blobs', can easily be recognized as, say, a face, after having seen the same image un-degraded. This conscious perception of the fragmented stimuli relies on top-down priming influences from systems involved in attention and mental imagery on the processing of stimulus attributes, and feature-binding [Dolan, R. J., Fink, G. R., Rolls, E., Booth, M., Holmes, A., Frackowiak, R. S. J., et al. (1997). How the brain learns to see objects and faces in an impoverished context. Nature, 389, 596-599]. In Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC), face processing abnormalities are well-established, but top-down anomalies in various domains have also been shown. Thus, we tested two alternative hypotheses: (i) that people with ASC show overall reduced top-down modulation in visual perception, or (ii) that top-down anomalies affect specifically the perception of faces. Participants were presented with sets of three consecutive images: degraded images (of faces or objects), corresponding or non-corresponding grey-scale photographs, and the same degraded images again. In a passive viewing sequence we compared gaze times (an index of focal attention) on faces/objects vs. background before and after viewers had seen the undegraded photographs. In an active viewing sequence, we compared how many faces/objects were identified pre- and post-exposure. Behavioural and gaze tracking data showed significantly reduced effects of prior knowledge on the conscious perception of degraded faces, but not objects in the ASC group. Implications for future work on the underlying mechanisms, at the cognitive and neurofunctional levels, are discussed.
20024608	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0917-y	No increase in criminal convictions in Hans Asperger's original cohort.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Kathrin Hippler, Essi Viding, Christian Klicpera, Francesca Happé		"Hans Asperger originally used the term ""autistic psychopathy"" to describe his patients on the autism spectrum, leading to a possible confusion with psychopathic disorder and delinquent behaviour. We conducted a penal register search for 177 former patients of Asperger's clinic with a childhood diagnosis of ""autistic psychopathy"" or features of the disorder in Austria. The mean percentage of registered convictions was similar to that in the general male population of Austria over the studied time period. A qualitative assessment of offence types in Asperger's former patients suggests that the nature of offences does not differ from that in the general population. In this original cohort of Asperger's patients, convictions were no more common than in the general male population."

Surveillance summaries (Washington, D.C. : 2002)	2009			Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of developmental disabilities characterized by atypical development in socialization, communication, and behavior. ASDs typically are apparent before age 3 years, with associated impairments affecting multiple areas of a person's life. Because no biologic marker exists for ASDs, identification is made by professionals who evaluate a child's developmental progress to identify the presence of developmental disorders.

Clinical genetics	2010	A Crepel, J Breckpot, J-P Fryns, W De la Marche, J Steyaert, K Devriendt, H Peeters		We describe the identification and delineation of an inherited 2.07 Mb microduplication in 1q42.2 in two brothers with autism and mild mental retardation. Since this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, we consider this as an extremely rare variant which has the potential to provide further insight into the genetics of autism. The duplication contains seven genes including the DISC1 gene, an interesting candidate gene that has been associated to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism and Asperger syndrome. In this report we describe additional analyses undertaken to investigate the causal relationship of the duplication to the autism phenotype. We conclude that the 1q42.2 microduplication probably confers susceptibility to autism in the current family. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causality of a very rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease and the challenge of genetic counselling in a particular family.
19998539		Generativity and imagination in autism spectrum disorder: evidence from individual differences in children's impossible entity drawings.	The British journal of developmental psychology	2009	Jason Low, Elizabeth Goddard, Joseph Melser		This study examined the cognitive underpinnings of spontaneous imagination in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by way of individual differences. Children with ASD (N = 27) and matched typically developing (TD) children were administered Karmiloff-Smith's (1990) imaginative drawing task, along with measures that tapped specific executive functions (generativity, visuospatial planning, and central coherence processing style) and false belief theory of mind (ToM) understanding. The ASD group drawings displayed deficits in imaginative content and a piecemeal pictorial style. ASD participants also showed group deficits in generativity, planning and ToM, and exhibited weak coherence. Individual differences in generativity were related to imaginative drawing content in the ASD group, and the association was mediated through planning ability. Variations in weak coherence were separately related to a piecemeal drawing style in the ASD group. Variations in generativity were also linked with imaginative drawing content in the TD group; the connection unfolded when it received pooled variance from receptive language ability, and thereupon mediated through false belief reasoning to cue imaginative content. Results are discussed in terms of how generativity plays a broad and important role for imagination in ASD and typical development, albeit in different ways.
19998356	doi: 10.1002/aur.103	Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms moderate cognition and behavior in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2009	Benjamin E Yerys, Gregory L Wallace, Jennifer L Sokoloff, Devon A Shook, Joette D James, Lauren Kenworthy		Recent estimates suggest that 31% of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) meet diagnostic criteria for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and another 24% of children with ASD exhibit subthreshold clinical ADHD symptoms. Presence of ADHD symptoms in the context of ASD could have a variety of effects on cognition, autistic traits, and adaptive/maladaptive behaviors including: exacerbating core ASD impairments; adding unique impairments specific to ADHD; producing new problems unreported in ASD or ADHD; having no clear impact; or producing some combination of these scenarios. Children with ASD and co-morbid ADHD symptoms (ASD+ADHD; n = 21), children with ASD without ADHD (ASD; n = 28), and a typically developing control group (n = 21) were included in the study; all groups were matched on age, gender-ratio, IQ, and socioeconomic status. Data were collected on verbal and spatial working memory, response inhibition, global executive control (EC), autistic traits, adaptive functioning, and maladaptive behavior problems. In this sample, the presence of ADHD symptoms in ASD exacerbated impairments in EC and adaptive behavior and resulted in higher autistic trait, and externalizing behavior ratings. ADHD symptoms were also associated with greater impairments on a lab measure of verbal working memory. These findings suggest that children with ASD+ADHD symptoms present with exacerbated impairments in some but not all domains of functioning relative to children with ASD, most notably in adaptive behavior and working memory. Therefore, ADHD may moderate the expression of components of the ASD cognitive and behavioral phenotype, but ASD+ADHD may not represent an etiologically distinct phenotype from ASD alone.
19963341	doi: 10.1016/j.ridd.2009.10.017	Behavioral treatment of chronic skin-picking in individuals with developmental disabilities: a systematic review.	Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Russell Lang, Robert Didden, Wendy Machalicek, Mandy Rispoli, Jeff Sigafoos, Giulio Lancioni, Austin Mulloy, April Regester, Nigel Pierce, Soyeon Kang		Skin-picking is a type of self-injurious behavior involving the pulling, scratching, lancing, digging, or gouging of one's own body. It is associated with social impairment, and increased medical and mental health concerns. While there are several reports showing that skin-picking is common in individuals with developmental disabilities, knowledge about effective treatment approaches is sparse. We therefore reviewed studies involving the treatment of chronic skin-picking in individuals with developmental disabilities. Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 16 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. These studies were evaluated in terms of: (a) participants, (b) functional assessment procedures and results, (c) intervention procedures, (d) results of the intervention, and (e) certainty of evidence. Across the 16 studies, intervention was provided to a total of 19 participants aged 6-42 years. Functional assessment procedures included direct observations, analog functional analyses, and functional assessment interviews. The most commonly identified function was automatic reinforcement. Treatment approaches included combinations of differential reinforcement, providing preferred items and activities stimuli (e.g., toys), wearing protective clothing (e.g., helmets or gloves), response interruption and redirection, punishment, and extinction. Improvements in behavior were reported in all of the reviewed studies. Suggestions for future intervention research are offered.
19961126		[Application of the MASC, a new instrument for measuring adolescents' social-cognitive competence].	Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie	2009	Jürgen Körner, Svetlana Chuleva, Hans-Joachim Clausen		The film-based MASC test, developed to identify patients with Asperger's, proved suitable for testing adolescents' and adults' social-cognitive competence. It differentiated young people with behavioural problems from those without (measured by SDQ) and showed significant differences between hyperactive adolescents and adolescents with behavioural problems; the hyperactive young people tended to select answers that indicated emotional overreaction to social information, while the young people with behavioural problems were more likely to give emotional content too little weight or ignore it altogether. The MASC shows satisfactory reliability, has a challenging character for young people, and is--in contrast to empathy questionnaires--not susceptible to subjects' tendency to provide socially desirable answers.

Journal of applied behavior analysis	2009	Jeffrey H Tiger, Wayne W Fisher, Kelly J Bouxsein		The use of differential reinforcement of other behavior (DRO) has decreased, at least partially due to the development of less effortful alternative behavioral interventions (e.g., noncontingent reinforcement; Vollmer, Iwata, Zarcone, Smith, & Mazaleski, 1993). The effort associated with DRO contingencies may be lessened by incorporating self-monitoring components in which clients are responsible for the delivery of reinforcers for their own behavior. The current study evaluates the effectiveness of DRO in the treatment of self-injury when implemented first by the therapist and subsequently by the client.

Herzschrittmachertherapie & Elektrophysiologie	2009	R F Bosch, H Krause-Allmendinger, P Villena, I Kruck		Telemedicine is used in various areas of cardiology, e.g., for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias and monitoring coronary artery disease and heart failure. Telemedicine is playing an increasing role is the monitoring of implantable devices (pacemakers, defibrillators, and event recorders). Most manufacturers of these devices have, in the meantime, telemedical concepts. The current guidelines of cardiac societies advocate the implantation of telemedicine-controlled devices. In the practical implementation of telemedicine devices, recruitment and involvement of patients, setting up of telemedicine consultation, legal aspects, and financing questions are of special relevance.
19933765	doi: 10.1177/1362361309335719	Multi-informant reports of psychiatric symptoms among high-functioning adolescents with Asperger syndrome or autism.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2009	Tuula Hurtig, Sanna Kuusikko, Marja-Leena Mattila, Helena Haapsamo, Hanna Ebeling, Katja Jussila, Leena Joskitt, David Pauls, Irma Moilanen		The aim of the study was to examine psychiatric symptoms in high-functioning adolescents with autism spectrum disorders reported by multiple informants. Forty-three 11- to 17-year-old adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) and 217 typically developed adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR), while their parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Teachers of adolescents with AS/HFA completed the Teacher Report Form (TRF). The informants reported significantly more psychiatric symptoms, especially withdrawn, anxious/depressed, social and attention problems, in adolescents with AS/HFA than in controls. In contrast to findings in the general population, the psychiatric problems of adolescents with AS/HFA are well acknowledged by multiple informants, including self-reports. However, anxiety and depressive symptoms were more commonly reported by adolescents with AS/HFA and their teachers than their parents, indicating that some emotional distress may be hidden from their parents.

Education and practice edition	2009	Anne O'Hare	Section of Child Life & Health, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH9 1UW, UK. aohare@ed.ac.uk	"Autism spectrum disorders are of high prevalence and have a potentially complex range of presentations within the core impaired domains of social communication, reciprocal social interaction, imaginary thought and restricted and repetitive behaviours. Paediatricians need to recognise the possibility of these conditions among the high-risk populations of children with whom they work. This includes those presenting in the preschool years to child development clinics with delayed acquisition of language or general development delay or those presenting in the school years with coordination, academic, peer interaction and behavioural difficulties. In addition, paediatricians are essential members of the multidisciplinary teams charged with specialist assessment and their clinical history and examination can direct investigations for aetiology. This is a fast moving field with a challenging range of ""grey evidence"" causes and interventions. The approaches to managing these areas of work are discussed with an emphasis on recognition, important features in the history and clinical examination to aid differential diagnosis and investigations, interpreting the ""grey evidence"" and understanding intervention and prognosis."

Journal of proteome research	2010	Heidi R Fuller, Nguyen Thi Man, Le Thanh Lam, Le Thiet Thanh, Rebecca A Keough, Arndt Asperger, Thomas J Gonda, Glenn E Morris		"Understanding networks of interacting proteins is a major goal in cell biology. The survival of motor neurons protein (SMN) interacts, directly or indirectly, with a large number of other proteins and reduced levels of SMN cause the inherited disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Some SMN interactions are stable and stoichiometric, such as those with gemins, while others are expected to be transient and substoichiometric, such as the functional interaction of SMN with coilin in Cajal bodies. This study set out to determine whether novel components of the extensive SMN interactome can be identified by a proteomic approach. SMN complexes were immuno-precipitated from HeLa nuclear extracts, using anti-SMN monoclonal antibody attached to magnetic beads, digested with trypsin, separated by capillary-liquid chromatography and analyzed by MALDI TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. One-hundred and one proteins were detected with a p value of <0.05, SMN, gemins and U snRNPs being the dominant ""hits"". Sixty-nine of these were rejected after MALDI analysis of two control pull-downs using antibodies against unrelated nuclear proteins. The proteins found only in anti-SMN pulldowns were either known SMN partners, and/or contained dimethylated RG domains involved in direct interaction with the SMN tudor domain, or they were known binding partners of such direct SMN interactors. Myb-binding protein 1a, identified as a novel candidate, is a mainly nucleolar protein of unknown function but it partially colocalized with SMN in Cajal bodies in HeLa cell nucleoplasm and, like SMN, was reduced in cells from an SMA patient."
19915968	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0892-3	A Comprehensive Profile of Decoding and Comprehension in Autism Spectrum Disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Sabine V Huemer, Virginia Mann		The present study examined intake data from 384 participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and a comparison group of 100 participants with dyslexia on nine standardized measures of decoding and comprehension. Although diagnostic groups were based on parental reports and could not be verified independently, we were able to observe significant distinctions between subject groups. Overall findings confirm previous results of a disassociation between decoding and comprehension in ASD. Using a larger sample than previous studies and a greater variety of measures, a pattern of relatively intact decoding skills paired with low comprehension was found in autism, PDD-NOS, and Asperger's. In contrast, the dyslexic group showed the opposite pattern of stronger comprehension and weaker decoding.
19914264	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.11.007	Autobiographical memory, autonoetic consciousness, and identity in Asperger syndrome.	Neuropsychologia	2010	Tilait Tanweer, Clare J Rathbone, Celine Souchay		Previous results from research on individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) suggest a diminished ability for recalling episodic autobiographical memory (AM). The primary aim of this study was to explore autobiographical memory in individuals with Asperger syndrome and specifically to investigate whether memories in those with AS are characterized by fewer episodic 'remembered' events (due to a deficit in autonoetic consciousness). A further aim was to examine whether such changes in AM might also be related to changes in identity, due to the close relationship between memory and the self and to the established differences in self-referential processes in AS. Eleven adults with AS and fifteen matched comparison participants were asked to recall autobiographical memories from three lifetime periods and for each memory to give either a remember response (autonoetic consciousness) or a know response (noetic consciousness). The pattern of results shows that AS participants recalled fewer memories and that these memories were more often rated as known, compared to the comparison group. AS participants also showed differences in reported identity, generating fewer social identity statements and more abstract, trait-linked identities. The data support the view that differences in both memory and reported personal identities in AS are characterized by a lack of specificity.

19908142	doi: 10.1007/s10484-009-9120-3	Neurofeedback outcomes in clients with Asperger's syndrome.	Applied psychophysiology and biofeedback	2010	Lynda Thompson, Michael Thompson, Andrea Reid		This paper summarizes data from a review of neurofeedback (NFB) training with 150 clients with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and 9 clients with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) seen over a 15 year period (1993-2008) in a clinical setting. The main objective was to investigate whether electroncephalographic (EEG) biofeedback, also called neurofeedback (NFB), made a significant difference in clients diagnosed with AS. An earlier paper (Thompson et al. 2009) reviews the symptoms of AS, highlights research findings and theories concerning this disorder, discusses QEEG patterns in AS (both single and 19-channel), and details a hypothesis, based on functional neuroanatomy, concerning how NFB, often paired with biofeedback (BFB), might produce a change in symptoms. A further aim of the current report is to provide practitioners with a detailed description of the method used to address some of the key symptoms of AS in order to encourage further research and clinical work to refine the use of NFB plus BFB in the treatment of AS. All charts were included for review where there was a diagnosis of AS or ASD and pre- and post-training testing results were available for one or more of the standardized tests used. Clients received 40-60 sessions of NFB, which was combined with training in metacognitive strategies and, for most older adolescent and adult clients, with BFB of respiration, electrodermal response, and, more recently, heart rate variability. For the majority of clients, feedback was contingent on decreasing slow wave activity (usually 3-7 Hz), decreasing beta spindling if it was present (usually between 23 and 35 Hz), and increasing fast wave activity termed sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) (12-15 or 13-15 Hz depending on assessment findings). The most common initial montage was referential placement at the vertex (CZ) for children and at FCz (midway between FZ and CZ) for adults, referenced to the right ear. Metacognitive strategies relevant to social understanding, spatial reasoning, reading comprehension, and math were taught when the feedback indicated that the client was relaxed, calm, and focused. Significant improvements were found on measures of attention (T.O.V.A. and IVA), core symptoms (Australian Scale for Asperger's Syndrome, Conners' Global Index, SNAP version of the DSM-IV criteria for ADHD, and the ADD-Q), achievement (Wide Range Achievement Test), and intelligence (Wechsler Intelligence Scales). The average gain for the Full Scale IQ score was 9 points. A decrease in relevant EEG ratios was also observed. The ratios measured were (4-8 Hz)(2)/(13-21 Hz)(2), (4-8 Hz)/(16-20 Hz), and (3-7 Hz)/(12-15 Hz). The positive outcomes of decreased symptoms of Asperger's and ADHD (including a decrease in difficulties with attention, anxiety, aprosodias, and social functioning) plus improved academic and intellectual functioning, provide preliminary support for the use of neurofeedback as a helpful component of effective intervention in people with AS.

However, there is significant variability in the clinical phenotype; for example, people with autism exhibit language delay whereas those with Asperger syndrome do not. It remains unclear whether localized differences in brain anatomy are associated with variation in the clinical phenotype.
19885834	doi: 10.1002/aur.97	A comprehensive volumetric analysis of the cerebellum in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2009	Julia A Scott, Cynthia Mills Schumann, Beth L Goodlin-Jones, David G Amaral		"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and postmortem neuropathological studies have implicated the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of autism. Controversy remains, however, concerning the nature and the consistency of cerebellar alterations. MRI studies of the cross-sectional area of the vermis have found both decreases and no difference in autism groups. Volumetric analysis of the vermis, which is less prone to ""plane of section artifacts"" may provide a more reliable assessment of size differences but few such studies exist in the literature. Here we present the results of a volumetric analysis of the structure of the whole cerebellum and its components in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Structural MRI's were acquired from 62 male participants (7.5 to 18.5 years-old) who met criteria for the following age-matched diagnostic groups: low functioning autism, high functioning autism (HFA), Asperger syndrome, and typically developing children. When compared to controls, the midsagittal area of the vermis, or of subgroups of lobules, was not reduced in any of the autism groups. However, we did find that total vermis volume was decreased in the combined autism group. When examined separately, the vermis of only the HFA group was significantly reduced compared to typically developing controls. Neither IQ nor age predicted the size of the vermis within the autism groups. There were no differences in the volume of individual vermal lobules or cerebellar hemispheres. These findings are discussed in relation to the pathology of autism and to the fairly common alterations of vermal morphology in various neurodevelopmental disorders."
19883170	doi: 10.3109/14015430903311184	Perception of basic emotions from speech prosody in adolescents with Asperger's syndrome.	Logopedics, phoniatrics, vocology	2010	Jenna Heikkinen, Eira Jansson-Verkasalo, Juhani Toivanen, Kalervo Suominen, Eero Väyrynen, Irma Moilanen, Tapio Seppänen		Asperger's syndrome (AS) belongs to the group of autism spectrum disorders and is characterized by deficits in social interaction, as manifested e.g. by the lack of social or emotional reciprocity. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in social interaction. Abnormal prosody has been frequently identified as a core feature of AS. There are virtually no studies on recognition of basic emotions from speech. This study focuses on how adolescents with AS (n=12) and their typically developed controls (n=15) recognize the basic emotions happy, sad, angry, and 'neutral' from speech prosody. Adolescents with AS recognized basic emotions from speech prosody as well as their typically developed controls did. Possibly the recognition of basic emotions develops during the childhood.

Research in developmental disabilities	2010	Mats Cederlund, Bibbi Hagberg, Christopher Gillberg		Descriptive and comparative follow-up studies of young adult males with Asperger syndrome (AS) diagnosed in childhood, using both interview, self- and parent assessment instruments for the study of aspects of emotional well-being, social functioning, and cognitive-practical skills have not been performed in the past. One-hundred males with AS diagnosed in childhood were approached for the assessment using the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Interview (ASDI), (personal and parent interview), the Leiter-R-Questionnaires, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DEX). About 75% of the targeted group participated. The ASDI results came out significantly different at personal vs parent interviews in several key domains. In contrast, the Leiter-R-Questionnaires, showed no significant differences across the individuals with AS and their parents in the scoring of cognitive/social and emotional/adaptive skills. The BDI proved to be an adequate screening instrument for depression in that it correctly identified the vast majority of cases with clinical depression in the AS group. The DEX results suggested an executive function deficit problem profile in males with AS as severe as that reported in groups of individuals with traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. Interviews (personal and collateral), and self-rating and parent-rating questionnaires all have a role in the comprehensive diagnostic process in AS and other autism spectrum disorders, and could be used as adjuncts when evaluating whether or not individuals meeting diagnostic symptom criteria for the condition have sufficient problems in daily life to warrant a clinical diagnosis of AS.
19859795	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0885-2	Stimulus characteristics affect humor processing in individuals with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Andrea C Samson, Michael Hegenloh		The present paper aims to investigate whether individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) show global humor processing deficits or whether humor comprehension and appreciation depends on stimulus characteristics. Non-verbal visual puns, semantic and Theory of Mind cartoons were rated on comprehension, funniness and the punchlines were explained. AS individuals did not differ to the control group in humor appreciation of visual puns. However, they had difficulty understanding and appreciating Theory of Mind cartoons and provided mentalistic explanations less frequently than controls suggesting that humor processing is strongly related to the cognitive requirements that the stimuli pose on the perceiver. Furthermore, AS individuals referred in all conditions more frequently to non-joke relevant details. Therefore, humor processing is also influenced by their detail-oriented processing style.
19840888	doi: 10.1016/j.jneuroim.2009.09.015	Immune allergic response in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of neuroimmunology	2009	Elizabeth S Magalhães, Fernanda Pinto-Mariz, Sandra Bastos-Pinto, Adailton T Pontes, Evandro A Prado, Leonardo C deAzevedo		Asperger's syndrome is a subgroup of autism characterized by social deficits without language delay, and high cognitive performance. The biological nature of autism is still unknown but there are controversial evidence associating an immune imbalance and autism. Clinical findings, including atopic family history, serum IgE levels as well as cutaneous tests showed that incidence of atopy was higher in the Asperger group compared to the healthy controls. These findings suggest that atopy is frequent in this subgroup of autism implying that allergic inflammation might be an important feature in Asperger syndrome.
19840158	doi: 10.1111/j.1468-5922.2009.01812.x	Union and separation in the therapy of pervasive developmental disorders and ADHD.	The Journal of analytical psychology	2009	Toshio Kawai	Kokoro Research Center, Kyoto University. kawaitsh@aol.com	This paper discusses the characteristics of psychotherapy for pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) in the context of the curative effects of the movement of images. The 'autistic spectrum' is widened here and includes not only PDD, but also ADHD. The main common characteristic in these two sets of disorders seems to be the lack of a subject, which manifests itself as the absence of awareness of otherness and difficulties with boundaries and language. In these cases a normal psychotherapy is ineffective as it presupposes an established subject. However a psychotherapeutic approach with these patients can contribute to the emergence of a subject. In severe cases the process of union and separation which is enacted either in the therapeutic relationship or in symbolic play leads to the birth of a subject, and of language. In milder cases, such as ADHD, the moments of separation and confrontation with the therapist suffice. I will discuss a case of my own with Asperger's syndrome in which union and separation in the play therapy occurred simultaneously. This indicates that union and separation are not a consecutive process, but are simultaneous and lead to dialectical movement. However, in neurotic cases with an established subjectivity the symbolic meaning of image plays a central role. This corresponds to Jung's understanding of image in alchemy.

19822263	doi: 10.1016/j.neuro.2009.01.011	Associations between indoor environmental factors and parental-reported autistic spectrum disorders in children 6-8 years of age.	Neurotoxicology	2009	Malin Larsson, Bernard Weiss, Staffan Janson, Jan Sundell, Carl-Gustav Bornehag		Potential contributions of environmental chemicals and conditions to the etiology of Autism Spectrum Disorders are the subject of considerable current research and speculation. The present paper describes the results of a study undertaken as part of a larger project devoted to the connection between properties of the indoor environment and asthma and allergy in young Swedish children. The larger project, The Dampness in Buildings and Health (DBH) Study, began in the year 2000 with a questionnaire distributed to parents of all children 1-6 years of age in one Swedish county (DBH-I). A second, follow-up questionnaire (DBH-III) was distributed in 2005. The original survey collected information about the child, the family situation, practices such as smoking, allergic symptoms, type of residence, moisture-related problems, and type of flooring material, which included polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The 2005 survey, based on the same children, now 6-8 years of age, also asked if, during the intervening period, the child had been diagnosed with Autism, Asperger's syndrome, or Tourette's syndrome. From a total of 4779 eligible children, 72 (60 boys, 12 girls) were identified with parentally reported autism spectrum disorder. A random sample of 10 such families confirmed that the diagnoses had been made by medical professionals, in accordance with the Swedish system for monitoring children's health. An analysis of the associations between indoor environmental variables in 2000 as well as other background factors and the ASD diagnosis indicated five statistically significant variables: (1) maternal smoking; (2) male sex; (3) economic problems in the family; (4) condensation on windows, a proxy for low ventilation rate in the home; (5) PVC flooring, especially in the parents' bedroom. In addition, airway symptoms of wheezing and physician-diagnosed asthma in the baseline investigation (2000) were associated with ASD 5 years later. Results from the second phase of the DBH-study (DBH-II) indicate PVC flooring to be one important source of airborne phthalates indoors, and that asthma and allergy prevalence are associated with phthalate concentrations in settled dust in the children's bedroom. Because these associations are among the few linking ASD with environmental variables, they warrant further and more extensive exploration.
19813070	doi: 10.1007/s00787-009-0057-0	Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism: language, motor and cognitive profiles.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2010	Michele Noterdaeme, Elke Wriedt, Christian Höhne		The objective of this study is to compare the cognitive profile, the motor and language functioning and the psychosocial adaptation of children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and with high-functioning autism (HFA). Subjects were recruited through the department Autism and Developmental Disorders of the Heckscher-Klinikum. To be included in the study, the full-scale-IQ had to be at least 80. Subjects with AS had to have a normal early language development and subjects with HFA a clear delay in language development, as reported by their parents. The sample consisted of 57 children with Asperger syndrome and 55 children with high-functioning autism. The mean age of the children was 10 years. All subjects were examined with a standardised test battery. Children with AS had a higher full-scale-IQ than children with HFA. This was due to a higher verbal-IQ. There were no significant differences in the performance-IQ. At a mean age of 10 years, subjects with AS had better language skills than subjects with HFA, but at least 30% showed clear receptive language problems. Motor problems were present in about 50% of the children with AS and HFA. The level of psychosocial adaptation was clearly reduced, but was comparable for the two groups. The differences in verbal-IQ and language skills between the two groups could be explained through the definition of the syndromes. The presence of language problems in the subjects with AS at age 10, the comparable degree of motor impairment and level of psychosocial adaptation question the validity of the distinction between AS and HFA within the category of pervasive developmental disorders.

19781841	doi: 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.015	Dynamic fearful gaze does not enhance attention orienting in individuals with Asperger's disorder.	Brain and cognition	2009	Shota Uono, Wataru Sato, Motomi Toichi		Although impaired joint attention is one of the core clinical features of pervasive developmental disorder including autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder, experimental studies failed to report its impairment. This discrepancy might be the result of differences between real-life and experimental situations. The present study examined joint attention in 11 individuals with Asperger's disorder and 11 age-matched controls under naturalistic conditions using a target detection paradigm with dynamic emotional gaze cues. Although both groups showed gaze-triggered attention orienting as assessed by the differences in reaction time for invalid minus valid cues, enhancement of joint attention by fearful (vs. neutral) gaze was observed in the control, but not in the Asperger group. This suggests that the integration of emotion and gaze direction that elicits strong joint attention is impaired in individuals with Asperger's disorder.

Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Philipps-University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany. Institute of Medical Biometry and Epidemiology, Philipps University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany.	"An increasing number of animal studies advert to a substantial role of the neuropeptide oxytocin in the regulation of social attachment and affiliation. Furthermore, animal studies showed anxiety and stress-reduced effects of oxytocin. First human studies confirm these findings in animal studies and implicate a crucial role of oxytocin in human social attachment behavior and in social interactions. Thus, the oxytocin system might be involved in the impairment of social interaction and attachment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The human oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) represents a plausible candidate gene for the etiology of ASD. To analyze whether genetic variants in the OXTR gene are associated with ASD we performed family-based single-marker and haplotype association analyses with 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OXTR and its 5' region in 100 families with autistic disorders on high-functioning level (Asperger syndrome (AS), high-functioning autism (HFA), and atypical autism (AA)). Single-marker and haplotype association analyses revealed nominally significant associations of one single SNP and one haplotype with autism, respectively. Furthermore, employing a ""reverse phenotyping"" approach, patients carrying the haplotype associated with autism showed nominally significant impairments in comparison to noncarriers of the haplotype in items of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised algorithm describing aspects of social interaction and communication. In conclusion, our results implicate that genetic variation in the OXTR gene might be relevant in the etiology of autism on high-functioning level."
19770231	doi: 10.1177/1362361309335718	Attentional blink in young people with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2010	Nicole Rinehart, Bruce Tonge, Avril Brereton, John Bradshaw		The aim of the study was to examine the temporal characteristics of information processing in individuals with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder using a rapid serial visual presentation paradigm. The results clearly showed that such people demonstrate an attentional blink of similar magnitude to comparison groups. This supports the proposition that the social processing difficulties experienced by these individuals are not underpinned by a basic temporal-cognitive processing deficit, which is consistent with Minshew's complex information processing theory. This is the second study to show that automatic inhibitory processes are intact in both autism and Asperger's disorder, which appears to distinguish these disorders from some other frontostriatal disorders. The finding that individuals with autism were generally poorer than the comparison group at detecting black Xs, while being as good in responding to white letters, was accounted for in the context of a potential dual-task processing difficulty or visual search superiority.
19763808	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0860-y	Theory of mind in adults with HFA and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Annelies A Spek, Evert M Scholte, Ina A Van Berckelaer-Onnes		Theory of mind was assessed in 32 adults with HFA, 29 adults with Asperger syndrome and 32 neurotypical adults. The HFA and Asperger syndrome groups were impaired in performance of the Strange stories test and the Faux-pas test and reported more theory of mind problems than the neurotypical adults. The three groups did not differ in performance of the Eyes test. Furthermore, correlations between the Eyes test and the three other theory of mind tests were low or absent. Therefore one can question the ability of the Eyes test to measure theory of mind. Of all theory of mind tests used, the self-report questionnaire had the largest discriminating power in differentiating the two disorder groups from the neurotypical group.
19763806	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0867-4	Investigation of mentalizing and visuospatial perspective taking for self and other in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Nicole David, Carolin Aumann, Bettina H Bewernick, Natacha S Santos, Fritz-G Lehnhardt, Kai Vogeley		Mentalizing refers to making inferences about other people's mental states, whereas visuospatial perspective taking refers to inferring other people's viewpoints. Both abilities seem vital for social functioning; yet, their exact relationship is unclear. We directly compared mentalizing and visuospatial perspective taking in nineteen adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and fifteen control participants with the same stimulus material. Stimuli depicted virtual characters surrounded by two different objects. Virtual characters expressed a preference for one of the objects indicated by facial expression, gestures or head/body orientation. Compared to controls, participants with AS showed significantly increased reaction times and decreased accuracy for mentalizing (i.e., when inferring the virtual character's preference from the character's nonverbal bodily cues). By contrast, there were no significant group differences in perspective taking (i.e., by mental own-body transformations). These findings demonstrate, first, specific deficits in AS when mental states have to be inferred from nonverbal social cues. Second, visuospatial perspective taking may not necessarily be related to social impairments occurring in autism spectrum disorders.

Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are a group of psychiatric conditions in which the patient's clinical case history is characterized by disturbances in social interaction, deterioration of verbal and non-verbal communication, and presence of bizarre, limited and stereotyped activity. These disturbances affect multiple developmental areas and show up in very early stages of development, resulting in a permanent disorder. Many studies have sought to recognize causes and interventions for persons with PDD, however, they often take insufficient account of the effects these disorder can have on the lifestyle of patients and their families. These clinical case histories are so pervasive that they cause a disorder which upsets the equilibrium of the person's entire life. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of living with PDD on the person's quality of life and to highlight the factors that impact on the person and his/her family.
19751798	doi: 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2009.09.004	Auditory stream segregation in children with Asperger syndrome.	Biological psychology	2009	T Lepistö, A Kuitunen, E Sussman, S Saalasti, E Jansson-Verkasalo, T Nieminen-von Wendt, T Kujala		Individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) often have difficulties in perceiving speech in noisy environments. The present study investigated whether this might be explained by deficient auditory stream segregation ability, that is, by a more basic difficulty in separating simultaneous sound sources from each other. To this end, auditory event-related brain potentials were recorded from a group of school-aged children with AS and a group of age-matched controls using a paradigm specifically developed for studying stream segregation. Differences in the amplitudes of ERP components were found between groups only in the stream segregation conditions and not for simple feature discrimination. The results indicated that children with AS have difficulties in segregating concurrent sound streams, which ultimately may contribute to the difficulties in speech-in-noise perception.

International journal of epidemiology	2009	Natasha Nassar, Glenys Dixon, Jenny Bourke, Carol Bower, Emma Glasson, Nick de Klerk, Helen Leonard		It is unclear whether the increase in autism over the past two decades is a real increase or due to changes in diagnosis and ascertainment of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), which include autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). The aim of this study was to examine the trends in ASD over time in Western Australia (WA) and the possible effects and contribution of changes in diagnostic criteria, age at diagnosis, eligibility for service provision based on ASD diagnoses and changes in diagnostic practices.

ASD is characterized by varying degrees of impairment in communication skills, social interaction and restricted, repetitive stereotyped patterns of behavior. The five disorders under PDD are autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, Rett's disorder and PDD-not otherwise specified. ASD can often be reliably detected by the age of 3 years and, in some cases, as early as 18 months. The appearance of any warning signs of ASD is reason to have the child evaluated by a professional specializing in these disorders."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Martin A Volker, Christopher Lopata, Audrey M Smerbeck, Valerie A Knoll, Marcus L Thomeer, Jennifer A Toomey, Jonathan D Rodgers		BASC-2 PRS profiles of 62 children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFASDs) were compared with those of 62 typically-developing children matched by age, gender, and ethnicity. Results indicated that, except for the Somatization, Conduct Problems, and Aggression scales, significant differences were found between the HFASD and typically-developing groups on all PRS scores. Mean HFASD scores were in the clinically significant range on the Behavioral Symptoms Index, Atypicality, Withdrawal, and Developmental Social Disorders scales. At-risk range HFASD means were obtained on the Adaptive Skills composite, all adaptive scales, remaining content scales (except Bullying), and Hyperactivity, Attention Problems, and Depression clinical scales. Screening indices suggested that the Developmental Social Disorders scale was highly effective in differentiating between the two groups.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2010	Kerri L Staples, Greg Reid		Delays and deficits may both contribute to atypical development of movement skills by children with ASD. Fundamental movement skills of 25 children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (ages 9-12 years) were compared to three typically developing groups using the Test of Gross Motor Development (TGMD-2). The group matched on chronological age performed significantly better on the TGMD-2. Another comparison group matched on movement skill demonstrated children with ASD perform similarly to children approximately half their age. Comparisons to a third group matched on mental age equivalence revealed the movement skills of children with ASD are more impaired than would be expected given their cognitive level. Collectively, these results suggest the movement skills of children with ASD reflect deficits in addition to delays.

19652773		[Two main mistakes in classificatory and clinical function of DSM-IV, in the case of differential diagnosis between Asperger and autistic disorder].	Vertex (Buenos Aires, Argentina)	2009	Joaquín E Areta	"Centro de Rehabilitación ""Vida"" para discapacitados mentales adultos. aretajoaquin@yahoo.com.ar"	Symptomatic description of what the DSM-IV understands for Asperger's and Autistic Disorder was analyzed. As a result of this revision there was found that a great amount of diagnostic criteria overlap, and lead to the impossibility to make a clear differential diagnosis. The classifying function is, thus, criticized. The clinical function of this diagnostic distinction is analyzed through a clinical case. It is shown it's lack of utility when a therapeutic method should be implemented in a case of Autistic Disorder. It is concluded that the statistical value of the results obtained by using this classificatory instrument should be examined due to this lack of distinction. Also, according to the therapeutic approach witch the author makes reference, it is shown that the diagnostic of any both disorders does not modify the general intervention strategy.

19642087	doi: 10.1002/aur.83	Involuntary interpretation of social cues is compromised in autism spectrum disorders.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2009	Tjeerd Jellema, Jeannette Lorteije, Sophie van Rijn, Mascha van t' Wout, Edward de Haan, Herman van Engeland, Chantal Kemner		"A new social distance judgment task was used to measure quantitatively the extent to which social cues are immediately and involuntary interpreted by typically developing (TD) individuals and by individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The task thus tapped into the ability to involuntary ""pick up"" the meaning of social cues. The cues tested were social attention and implied biological motion. Task performance of the ASD and TD groups was similarly affected by a perceptual low-level illusion induced by physical characteristics of the stimuli. In contrast, a high-level illusion induced by the implications of the social cues affected only the TD individuals; the ASD individuals remained unaffected (causing them to perform superior to TD controls). The results indicate that despite intact perceptual processing, the immediate involuntary interpretation of social cues can be compromised. We propose that this type of social cue understanding is a distinct process that should be differentiated from reflective social cue understanding and is specifically compromised in ASD. We discuss evidence for an underpinning neural substrate."
19628325	doi: 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.06.007	Executive functions in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Brain and cognition	2009	Sally Robinson, Lorna Goddard, Barbara Dritschel, Mary Wisley, Pat Howlin		Executive dysfunction is a characteristic impairment of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). However whether such deficits are related to autism per se, or to associated intellectual disability is unclear. This paper examines executive functions in a group of children with ASD (N=54, all IQ > or = 70) in relation to a typically developing control group individually matched on the basis of age, gender, IQ and vocabulary. Significant impairments in the inhibition of prepotent responses (Stroop, Junior Hayling Test) and planning (Tower of London) were reported for children with ASD, with preserved performance for mental flexibility (Wisconsin Card Sorting Task) and generativity (Verbal Fluency). Atypical age-related patterns of performance were reported on tasks tapping response inhibition and self-monitoring for children with ASD compared to controls. The disparity between these and previous research findings are discussed. A multidimensional notion of executive functions is proposed, with difficulties in planning, the inhibition of prepotent responses and self-monitoring reflecting characteristic features of ASD that are independent of IQ and verbal ability, and relatively stable across the childhood years.
19627039		[Disorders of socialization in children and adolescents].	Harefuah	2009	Yael Brukner, Iris Manor, Gil Zalsman		According to psychiatric classification, problems in effective socialization adjustment are characteristic of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), autism and Asperger syndromes. However, working in a clinic divulges a significantly sizable section of the population that faces problems in social functioning but does not fit either of the two aforementioned psychiatric diagnoses. Over the years a number of informal diagnoses have been developed for this group. The current literature reviews these diagnoses and deals with the question of whether these diagnoses are indeed different or whether they constitute a different viewpoint of the same problem. Some authors claim that the scarcity of current knowledge makes it impossible to provide a proper and precise answer. Therefore, the correct and effective approach is to integrate all the different viewpoints. Such an integrative approach may assist in better understanding the developmental socializing difficulties at a later time. In attempting to characterize the developmental socializing difficulties beyond the mere diagnoses, three major research viewpoints were developed while studying this group: the biological viewpoint, the missing central viewpoint and the behavioral viewpoint.
19626749		Representations of autism: implications for community healthcare practice.	Community practitioner : the journal of the Community Practitioners' & Health Visitors' Association	2009	Charlotte Brownlow, Lindsay O'Dell		The work presented in this paper is part of a larger project in which online asynchronous discussion groups were employed to examine how a range of contributors--including people with autism, parents of people with autism, and professionals working within the field of autism--view and understand autism. In this paper, we focus on the voices of people with autism. The terminology used in the paper takes its lead from the writings of people with autism, who frequently use the term 'AS' to refer to autistic spectrum and Asperger syndrome and 'NT', which refers to neurologically typical people without autism. We examine a key theme identified in the online discussion groups--the representation of individuals with autism as occupying a separate world of autism. In doing so, we question an apparent goal of therapeutic interventions--to bring people with autism out of their 'separate world' and integrate them into a more typically 'social world'. We present an alternative understanding of autism that argues for valuing diversity and viewing autism as a difference rather than a deficit. We will discuss some of the implications that this may have for working with people with autism in health and social care practice.

Clinician-parent diagnostic agreement was high (90% Checklist, 90% CARS, and 84% GADS).
19608858	doi: 10.1126/science.1176170	Mindblind eyes: an absence of spontaneous theory of mind in Asperger syndrome.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	2009	Atsushi Senju, Victoria Southgate, Sarah White, Uta Frith		Adults with Asperger syndrome can understand mental states such as desires and beliefs (mentalizing) when explicitly prompted to do so, despite having impairments in social communication. We directly tested the hypothesis that such individuals nevertheless fail to mentalize spontaneously. To this end, we used an eye-tracking task that has revealed the spontaneous ability to mentalize in typically developing infants. We showed that, like infants, neurotypical adults' (n = 17 participants) eye movements anticipated an actor's behavior on the basis of her false belief. This was not the case for individuals with Asperger syndrome (n = 19). Thus, these individuals do not attribute mental states spontaneously, but they may be able to do so in explicit tasks through compensatory learning.
19598235	doi: 10.1002/aur.80	Genes related to sex steroids, neural growth, and social-emotional behavior are associated with autistic traits, empathy, and Asperger syndrome.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2009	B Chakrabarti, F Dudbridge, L Kent, S Wheelwright, G Hill-Cawthorne, C Allison, S Banerjee-Basu, S Baron-Cohen		"Genetic studies of autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have mostly focused on the ""low functioning"" severe clinical subgroup, treating it as a rare disorder. However, ASC is now thought to be relatively common ( approximately 1%), and representing one end of a quasi-normal distribution of autistic traits in the general population. Here we report a study of common genetic variation in candidate genes associated with autistic traits and Asperger syndrome (AS). We tested single nucleotide polymorphisms in 68 candidate genes in three functional groups (sex steroid synthesis/transport, neural connectivity, and social-emotional responsivity) in two experiments. These were (a) an association study of relevant behavioral traits (the Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ)) in a population sample (n=349); and (b) a case-control association study on a sample of people with AS, a ""high-functioning"" subgroup of ASC (n=174). 27 genes showed a nominally significant association with autistic traits and/or ASC diagnosis. Of these, 19 genes showed nominally significant association with AQ/EQ. In the sex steroid group, this included ESR2 and CYP11B1. In the neural connectivity group, this included HOXA1, NTRK1, and NLGN4X. In the socio-responsivity behavior group, this included MAOB, AVPR1B, and WFS1. Fourteen genes showed nominally significant association with AS. In the sex steroid group, this included CYP17A1 and CYP19A1. In the socio-emotional behavior group, this included OXT. Six genes were nominally associated in both experiments, providing a partial replication. Eleven genes survived family wise error rate (FWER) correction using permutations across both experiments, which is greater than would be expected by chance. CYP11B1 and NTRK1 emerged as significantly associated genes in both experiments, after FWER correction (P<0.05). This is the first candidate-gene association study of AS and of autistic traits. The most promising candidate genes require independent replication and fine mapping."

Parents and/or teachers of higher-functioning (full-scale intelligence quotient > or = 50) 8-year-old total population school children (n = 4,408) and 7-12-year-old outpatients with AS/autism (n = 47) completed the Finnish version of the ASSQ. Agreement between informants was slight. In the whole total population, low positive correlation was found between parents' and teachers' ratings, while in the sample of high-scoring children the correlation turned out to be negative. A cut-off of 30 for parents' and teacher's summed score and 22 for teachers' single score is recommended. A valid cut-off for parents' single score could not been estimated. The clinicians are reminded that the ASSQ is a screening instrument, not a diagnosing instrument. The importance of using both parents' and teachers' ratings for screening in clinical settings is underlined.
19597797	doi: 10.1007/s00115-009-2820-3	[Autism and autistic disorders. Historical and current aspects].	Der Nervenarzt	2010	E Kumbier, G Domes, B Herpertz-Dahlmann, S C Herpertz		Since its first use in medical literature the meaning of the term autism has constantly changed. An historical overview indicates that in both adult and child psychiatry autism was first used to refer to a symptom of schizophrenia. Later on the use of the term in child psychiatry took a different independent course, which led to present-day conceptualization of autism, mainly due to the work of Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger. Currently autism and autistic disorders are regarded as severe developmental disorders and, due to their stable nature, have gained considerable attention in adult psychiatry. In order to better understand this development, the path from onset to reception is traced via Kanner and Asperger. In the search for central characteristics of autism, one finds restrictions in social communication and interaction, which can be explained by fundamental deficits in social cognition. These restrictions in social cognition can be considered the central characteristic of autism - one which has been a constant since the phenomenon was first described. Our historical review considers to what extent experimental psychopathological research can deepen our understanding of the disorder.
19592726		Designing affective video games to support the social-emotional development of teenagers with autism spectrum disorders.	Studies in health technology and informatics	2009	Mitu Khandaker	University of Portsmouth, UK.	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, comprised of three diagnostic entities - autistic disorder (AD), Asperger's disorder (AS), and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (including atypical autism) (PDD-NOS). A number of intervention techniques are currently used to reduce some of the associated challenges, with techniques ranging from behavioral therapy to dietary interventions and traditional counseling. This positional paper proposes the use of video games which leverage affective computing technologies as intervention in autism spectrum disorders in the context of the use of traditional play therapy with adolescents, who may feel uncomfortable engaging in traditional play with toys they may be too old for. It aims to explore the potential for greater 'social physics' made possible by affective computing technologies. This involves computationally 'recognizing' emotions in a user, often through the use of multimodal affective sensors, including facial expressions, postural shifts, and physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductivity, and EEG signals. However, it is suggested that this should be augmented by researching the effect of social game design mechanisms on social-emotional development, particularly for those who experience difficulty with social interaction.

19580821	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.06.028	Advantages of the multiple case series approach to the study of cognitive deficits in autism spectrum disorder.	Neuropsychologia	2009	Karren J Towgood, Julia D I Meuwese, Sam J Gilbert, Martha S Turner, Paul W Burgess		In the neuropsychological case series approach, tasks are administered that tap different cognitive domains, and differences within rather than across individuals are the basis for theorising; each individual is effectively their own control. This approach is a mainstay of cognitive neuropsychology, and is particularly suited to the study of populations with heterogeneous deficits. However it has very rarely been applied to the study of cognitive differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here, we investigate whether this approach can yield information beyond that given by the typical group study method, when applied to an ASD population. Twenty-one high-functioning adult ASD participants and 22 IQ, age, and gender-matched control participants were administered a large battery of neuropsychological tests that would represent a typical neuropsychological assessment for neurological patients in the United Kingdom. The data were analysed using both group and single-case study methods. The group analysis revealed a limited number of deficits, principally on tests with a large executive function component, with no impairment in more routine abilities such as basic attending, language and perception. Single-case study analysis proved more fruitful revealing evidence of considerable variation in abilities both between and within ASD participants. Both sub-normal and supra-normal performance were observed, with the most defining feature of the ASD group being this variability. We conclude that the use of group-level analysis alone in the study of cognitive deficits in ASD risks missing cognitive characteristics that may be vitally important both theoretically and clinically, and even may be misleading because of averaging artifact.
19572193	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0795-3	Brief report: IQ split predicts social symptoms and communication abilities in high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	David O Black, Gregory L Wallace, Jennifer L Sokoloff, Lauren Kenworthy		We investigated the relationship of discrepancies between VIQ and NVIQ (IQ split) to autism symptoms and adaptive behavior in a sample of high-functioning (mean FSIQ = 98.5) school-age children with autism spectrum disorders divided into three groups: discrepantly high VIQ (n = 18); discrepantly high NVIQ (n = 24); and equivalent VIQ and NVIQ (n = 36). Discrepantly high VIQ and NVIQ were associated with autism social symptoms but not communication symptoms or repetitive behaviors. Higher VIQ and NVIQ were associated with better adaptive communication but not socialization or Daily Living Skills. IQ discrepancy may be an important phenotypic marker in autism. Although better verbal abilities are associated with better functional outcomes in autism, discrepantly high VIQ in high-functioning children may also be associated with social difficulties.

Changes in FGF and its receptors have also been observed in schizophrenia and related developmental disorders. The current study examines a transgenic th(tk-)/th(tk-) mouse model with FGF receptor signaling disruption targeted to dopamine (DA) neurons, resulting in neurodevelopmental, anatomical, and biochemical alterations similar to those observed in human schizophrenia. We show in th(tk-)/th(tk-) mice that hypoplastic development of DA systems induces serotonergic hyperinnervation of midbrain DA nuclei, demonstrating the co-developmental relationship between DA and 5-HT systems. Behaviorally, th(tk-)/th(tk-) mice displayed impaired sensory gaiting and reduced social interactions correctable by atypical antipsychotics (AAPD) and a specific 5-HT2A antagonist, M100907. The adult onset of neurochemical and behavioral deficits was consistent with the postpubertal time course of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and related disorders. The spectrum of abnormalities observed in th(tk-)/th(tk-) mice and the ability of AAPD to correct the behavioral deficits consistent with human psychosis suggests that midbrain 5-HT2A-controlling systems are important loci of therapeutic action. These results may provide further insight into the complex multi-neurotransmitter etiology of neurodevelopmental diseases such autism, bipolar disorder, Asperger's Syndrome and schizophrenia.

Existing theories concerning AS are described, including theory of mind (Hill and Frith in Phil Trans Royal Soc Lond, Bull 358:281-289, 2003), mirror neuron system (Ramachandran and Oberman in Sci Am 295(5):62-69, 2006), and Porges' (Ann N Y Acad Sci 1008:31-47, 2003, The neurobiology of autism, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 2004) polyvagal theory. (A second paper, Outcomes using EEG Biofeedback Training in Clients with Asperger's Syndrome, summarizes clinical outcomes obtained with more than 150 clients.) Patterns seen with QEEG assessment are then presented. Single channel assessment at the vertex (CZ) reveals patterns similar to those found in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Using 19-channel data, significant differences (z-scores > 2) were found in the amplitude of both slow waves (excess theta and/or alpha) and fast waves (beta) at various locations. Differences from the norm were most often found in mirror neuron areas (frontal, temporal and temporal-parietal). There were also differences in coherence patterns, as compared to a normative database (Neuroguide). Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Analysis (Pascual-Marqui et al. in Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol 24C:91-95, 2002) suggested the source of the abnormal activity was most often the anterior cingulate. Other areas involved included the amygdala, uncus, insula, hippocampal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and the orbito-frontal and/or ventromedial areas of the prefrontal cortex. Correspondence between symptoms and the functions of the areas found to have abnormalities is evident and those observations are used to develop a rationale for using EEG biofeedback, called neurofeedback (NFB), intervention. NFB training is targeted to improve symptoms that include difficulty reading and mirroring emotions, poor attention to the outside world, poor self-regulation skills, and anxiety. Porges' polyvagal theory is used to emphasize the need to integrate NFB with biofeedback (BFB), particularly heart rate variability training. We term this emerging understanding the Systems Theory of Neural Synergy. The name underscores the fact that NFB and BFB influence dynamic circuits and emphasizes that, no matter where we enter the nervous system with an intervention, it will seek its own new balance and equilibrium.

19557496	doi: 10.1007/s00787-009-0035-6	Obsessive-compulsive traits in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2010	Liliana Ruta, Diego Mugno, Valentina Genitori D'Arrigo, Benedetto Vitiello, Luigi Mazzone		The objective of this study is to examine the occurrence and characteristic features of obsessive-compulsive behaviours in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS), with respect to a matched obsessive compulsive disorder group (OCD) and a typically developing control group (CG). For this purpose, 60 subjects (20 OCD; 18 AS; 22 CG), aged 8-15 years, matched for age, gender and IQ were compared. AS and OCD patients were diagnosed according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria. The Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule were used to assist in the AS diagnosis; the WISC-R was administered to assess IQ. Obsessive and compulsive symptoms were evaluated by using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). None of the AS children received a formal diagnosis of OCD. The AS group presented significantly higher frequencies of Hoarding obsessions and Repeating, Ordering and Hoarding compulsions compared to CG. The OCD group, in turn, reported significantly higher frequencies of Contamination and Aggressive obsessions and Checking compulsions compared to both the AS group and CG. As expected, the OCD group displayed a higher severity of symptoms (Moderate level of severity) than did the AS group (Mild level of severity). Finally, in our sample, neither the OCD group nor the AS group demonstrated a completely full awareness of the intrusive, unreasonable and distressing nature of symptoms, and the level of insight did not differ between the OCD group and CG, although an absence of insight was observed in the AS group. Children with AS showed higher frequencies of obsessive and compulsive symptoms than did typically developing children, and these features seem to cluster around Hoarding behaviours. Additionally, different patterns of symptoms emerged between the OCD and AS groups. Finally, in our sample, the level of insight was poor in both the OCD and the AS children. Further research should be conducted to better understand the characteristics of repetitive thoughts and behaviours in autism spectrum disorders, and to clarify the underlying neurobiological basis of these symptoms.

These clinical features are shared with six recently reported patients with a 15q24 microdeletion, supporting the notion that this is a recognizable syndrome. We describe a case of an ~2.6 Mb microduplication involving a portion of the minimal deletion critical region in a 15-year-old male with short stature, mild mental retardation, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Asperger syndrome, decreased joint mobility, digital abnormalities, and characteristic facial features. Some of these features are shared with a recently reported case with a 15q24 microduplication involving the minimal deletion critical region. We also report two siblings and their mother with duplication adjacent and distal to this region exhibiting mild developmental delay, hypotonia, tapering fingers, characteristic facial features, and prominent ears. The deletion and duplication breakpoints were mapped by array comparative genomic hybridization and the genomic structure in 15q24 was analyzed further. Surprisingly, in addition to the previously recognized three low-copy repeat clusters (BP1, BP2, and BP3), we identified two other paralogous low-copy repeat clusters that likely mediated the formation of alternative sized 15q24 genomic rearrangements via non-allelic homologous recombination.

Strabismus	2009	Anil Kumar, Nagini Sarvananthan, Frank Proudlock, Mervyn Thomas, Eryl Roberts, Irene Gottlob		Asperger syndrome is a severe and chronic developmental disorder. It is closely associated with autism and is grouped under autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Various eye movement abnormalities in AS have been reported in literature such as increased errors and latencies on the antisaccadic task implicating dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex, impairment of the pursuit especially for targets presented in the right visual hemisphere, suggesting disturbance in the left extrastraite cortex. There are no reports in the literature of association between idiopathic infantile nystagmus (IIN) and AS. We report 2 cases of Asperger syndrome associated with idiopathic infantile nystagmus.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	James Ladell Sanders	Department of Educational Psychology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada T6G 2G5. sanders1@ualberta.ca	The histories of autism and Asperger's Disorder (AD), based on original contributions by Kanner and Asperger, are reviewed in relation to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Their original articles appear to have influenced the distinction between AD and autism made in the DSM-IV. Based on up-to-date empirical research, however, it appears that AD and autism are not qualitatively distinct disorders, but are different quantitative manifestations of the same disorder. The differences between AD and autism may be a function of individual variability in these areas, not the manifestation of qualitatively distinct disorders. The DSM-IV criteria for AD and autism need to be considered with their historical developments, and based on empirical evidence, the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria may be subject to critical review.
19545994	doi: 10.1016/j.conb.2009.06.003	A synaptic trek to autism.	Current opinion in neurobiology	2009	Thomas Bourgeron	Human Genetics and Cognitive Functions, Institut Pasteur, 25 rue du Docteur Roux, 75015 Paris, France. thomasb@pasteur.fr	Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are diagnosed on the basis of three behavioral features namely deficits in social communication, absence or delay in language, and stereotypy. The susceptibility genes to ASD remain largely unknown, but two major pathways are emerging. Mutations in TSC1/TSC2, NF1, or PTEN activate the mTOR/PI3K pathway and lead to syndromic ASD with tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, or macrocephaly. Mutations in NLGN3/4, SHANK3, or NRXN1 alter synaptic function and lead to mental retardation, typical autism, or Asperger syndrome. The mTOR/PI3K pathway is associated with abnormal cellular/synaptic growth rate, whereas the NRXN-NLGN-SHANK pathway is associated with synaptogenesis and imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory currents. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that abnormal synaptic homeostasis represent a risk factor to ASD.
19543821	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0786-4	Brief report: inhibitory control of socially relevant stimuli in children with high functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Hilde M Geurts, Sander Begeer, Lex Stockmann		The current study explored whether inhibitory control deficits in high functioning autism (HFA) emerged when socially relevant stimuli were used and whether arousal level affected the performance. A Go/NoGo paradigm, with socially relevant stimuli and varying presentation rates, was applied in 18 children with HFA (including children with autism or Asperger syndrome) and 22 typically developing children (aged 8-13 years). Children with HFA did not show inhibitory control deficits compared to the control group, but their performance deteriorated in the slow presentation rate condition. Findings were unrelated to children's abilities to recognize emotions. Hence, rather than a core deficit in inhibitory control, low arousal level in response to social stimuli might influence the responses given by children with HFA.

19533800	doi: 10.1002/ajmg.a.32914	Clinical and molecular characterization of duplications encompassing the human SHOX gene reveal a variable effect on stature.	American journal of medical genetics. Part A	2009	N Simon Thomas, John F Harvey, David J Bunyan, Julia Rankin, Giedre Grigelioniene, Damien L Bruno, Tiong Y Tan, Susan Tomkins, Robert Hastings		Deletions of the SHOX gene are well documented and cause disproportionate short stature and variable skeletal abnormalities. In contrast interstitial SHOX duplications limited to PAR1 appear to be very rare and the clinical significance of the only case report in the literature is unclear. Mapping of this duplication has now shown that it includes the entire SHOX gene but little flanking sequence and so will not encompass any of the long-range enhancers required for SHOX transcription. We now describe the clinical and molecular characterization of three additional cases. The duplications all included the SHOX coding sequence but varied in the amount of flanking sequence involved. The probands were ascertained for a variety of reasons: hypotonia and features of Asperger syndrome, Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD), and a family history of cleft palate. However, the presence of a duplication did not correlate with any of these features or with evidence of skeletal abnormality. Remarkably, the proband with LWD had inherited both a SHOX deletion and a duplication. The effect of the duplications on stature was variable: height appeared to be elevated in some carriers, particularly in those with the largest duplications, but was still within the normal range. SHOX duplications are likely to be under ascertained and more cases need to be identified and characterized in detail in order to accurately determine their phenotypic consequences.

Series B, Biological sciences	2009	Douwe Draaisma	Heymans Institute, University of Groningen, PO Box 72, 9700 AB Groningen, The Netherlands. d.draaisma@rug.nl	In their landmark papers, both Kanner and Asperger employed a series of case histories to shape clinical insight into autistic disorders. This way of introducing, assessing and representing disorders has disappeared from today's psychiatric practice, yet it offers a convincing model of the way stereotypes may build up as a result of representations of autism. Considering that much of what society at large learns on disorders on the autism spectrum is produced by representations of autism in novels, TV-series, movies or autobiographies, it will be of vital importance to scrutinize these representations and to check whether or not they are, in fact, misrepresenting autism. In quite a few cases, media representations of talent and special abilities can be said to have contributed to a harmful divergence between the general image of autism and the clinical reality of the autistic condition.

I use language to narrate the photo-realistic pictures that pop up in my imagination. When I design equipment for the cattle industry, I can test run it in my imagination similar to a virtual reality computer program. All my thinking is associative and not linear. To form concepts, I sort pictures into categories similar to computer files. To form the concept of orange, I see many different orange objects, such as oranges, pumpkins, orange juice and marmalade. I have observed that there are three different specialized autistic/Asperger cognitive types. They are: (i) visual thinkers such as I who are often poor at algebra, (ii) pattern thinkers such as Daniel Tammet who excel in math and music but may have problems with reading or writing composition, and (iii) verbal specialists who are good at talking and writing but they lack visual skills.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Christine A Limbers, Robert W Heffer, James W Varni		HRQOL as a multidimensional construct has not been previously investigated in children with Asperger's Syndrome. The objective of the present study was to examine the initial feasibility, reliability, and validity of the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales and PedsQL Cognitive Functioning Scale parent proxy-report versions in school-aged children with Asperger's Syndrome. The PedsQL evidenced no missing responses (0.0%), achieved excellent reliability for the Generic Core Total Scale score (alpha = 0.82) and Cognitive Functioning Scale (alpha = 0.92), distinguished between children with Asperger's Syndrome and a matched sample of healthy children, and was related to similar constructs on the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale. The results demonstrate the initial measurement properties of the PedsQL in school-aged children with Asperger's Syndrome.

19500604	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2009.05.019	Impaired recognition of emotions from body movements is associated with elevated motion coherence thresholds in autism spectrum disorders.	Neuropsychologia	2009	Anthony P Atkinson	Department of Psychology, Durham University, UK. a.p.atkinson@durham.ac.uk	Recent research has confirmed that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties in recognizing emotions from body movements. Difficulties in perceiving coherent motion are also common in ASD. Yet it is unknown whether these two impairments are related. Thirteen adults with ASD and 16 age- and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) adults classified basic emotions from point-light and full-light displays of body movements and discriminated the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms. The ASD group was reliably less accurate in classifying emotions regardless of stimulus display type, and in perceiving coherent motion. As predicted, ASD individuals with higher motion coherence thresholds were less accurate in classifying emotions from body movements, especially in the point-light displays; this relationship was not evident for the TD group. The results are discussed in relation to recent models of biological motion processing and known abnormalities in the neural substrates of motion and social perception in ASD.

NeuroImage	2009	Luca Pugliese, Marco Catani, Stephanie Ameis, Flavio Dell'Acqua, Michel Thiebaut de Schotten, Clodagh Murphy, Dene Robertson, Quinton Deeley, Eileen Daly, Declan G M Murphy		It has been suggested that people with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) have altered development (and connectivity) of limbic circuits. However, direct evidence of anatomical differences specific to white matter pathways underlying social behaviour and emotions in ASD is lacking. We used Diffusion Tensor Imaging Tractography to compare, in vivo, the microstructural integrity and age-related differences in the extended limbic pathways between subjects with Asperger syndrome and healthy controls. Twenty-four males with Asperger syndrome (mean age 23+/-12 years, age range: 9-54 years) and 42 age-matched male controls (mean age 25+/-10 years, age range: 9-54 years) were studied. We quantified tract-specific diffusivity measurements as indirect indexes of microstructural integrity (e.g. fractional anisotropy, FA; mean diffusivity, MD) and tract volume (e.g. number of streamlines) of the main limbic tracts. The dissected limbic pathways included the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior frontal occipital fasciculus, uncinate, cingulum and fornix. There were no significant between-group differences in FA and MD. However, compared to healthy controls, individuals with Asperger syndrome had a significantly higher number of streamlines in the right (p=.003) and left (p=.03) cingulum, and in the right (p=.03) and left (p=.04) inferior longitudinal fasciculus. In contrast, people with Asperger syndrome had a significantly lower number of streamlines in the right uncinate (p=.02). Within each group there were significant age-related differences in MD and number of streamlines, but not FA. However, the only significant age-related between-group difference was in mean diffusivity of the left uncinate fasciculus (Z(obs)=2.05) (p=.02). Our preliminary findings suggest that people with Asperger syndrome have significant differences in the anatomy, and maturation, of some (but not all) limbic tracts.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Anna J Esbensen, Jan S Greenberg, Marsha Mailick Seltzer, Michael G Aman		Medication use was examined in 286 adolescents and adults with ASD over a 4.5 year period. A total of 70% were taking a psychotropic or non-psychotropic medication at the beginning of the study. Both the number of psychotropic and non-psychotropic medications taken, and the proportion of individuals taking these medications, increased significantly over the study period, with 81% taking at least one medication 4.5 years later. Our findings suggested a high likelihood of staying medicated over time. Thus, adolescents and adults with ASD are a highly and increasingly medicated population.

Biomedical chromatography : BMC	2009	Kevin Carr, Paul Whiteley, Paul Shattock		Elevated levels of trans-indolyl-3-acryloylglycine (IAcrGly) have been reported in the urine of people with various conditions including pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) such as autism and Asperger syndrome. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultra-violet detection using traditional particle silica-based columns subsequent to solid-phase extraction (SPE) has been the preferred assay method; requiring long analytical run times, high flow rates and high solvent usage. Recent developments in monolithic HPLC column technology facilitated the development of a novel analytical method, for the detection and quantification of urinary IAcrGly. The revised method eliminates the requirement for SPE pre-treatment, reduces sample run-time and decreases solvent volumes. Five urine samples from people diagnosed with PDD were run in quadruplicate to test the intra- and inter-day reliability of the new method based on retention time, peak area and peak height for IAcrGly. Detection was by UV with IAcrGly confirmation by MS/MS-MS. Relative standard deviations showed significant improvement with the new method for all parameters. The new method represents a major advancement in the detection and quantification of IAcrGly by reducing time and cost of analysis whilst improving detection limits and reproducibility.
19401185	doi: 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.12.076	Aberrant functional connectivity in autism: evidence from low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations.	Brain research	2009	Sarah K Noonan, Frank Haist, Ralph-Axel Müller		A number of recent studies have examined functional connectivity in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), generally converging on the finding of reduced interregional coordination, or underconnectivity. Underconnectivity has been reported between many brain regions and across a range of cognitive tasks, and has been proposed to underlie behavioral and cognitive impairments associated with ASD. The current study employed functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) to examine interregional correlations of low-frequency BOLD signal fluctuations in 10 high-functioning participants with ASD and 10 typically developing control participants. Whole-brain connectivity with three seed regions of interest (left middle frontal, left superior parietal, and left middle occipital cortex) was evaluated using fMRI datasets acquired during performance of a source recognition task. While fcMRI patterns were found to be largely similar across the two groups, including many common areas, effects for the ASD group were generally more extensive. These findings, although inconsistent with generalized underconnectivity in ASD, are compatible with a model of aberrant connectivity in which the nature of connectivity disturbance (i.e., increased or reduced) may vary by region. Taking into consideration methodological factors that might influence measured fcMRI effects, we suggest that ASD is associated with an inefficiency in optimizing network connections to achieve task performance.

Although typical obsessive-compulsive symptoms were predominant, the case also exhibits differences compared with regular obsessive-compulsive disorder regarding onset and course that are discussed in the report.

Journal of learning disabilities	2009	Tracy Packiam Alloway, Gnanathusharan Rajendran, Lisa M D Archibald		The aim of the present study was to directly compare working memory skills across students with different developmental disorders to investigate whether the uniqueness of their diagnosis would impact memory skills. The authors report findings confirming differential memory profiles on the basis of the following developmental disorders: Specific Language Impairment, Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, and Asperger syndrome (AS). Specifically, language impairments were associated with selective deficits in verbal short-term and working memory, whereas motor impairments (DCD) were associated with selective deficits in visuospatial short-term and working memory. Children with attention problems were impaired in working memory in both verbal and visuospatial domains, whereas the children with AS had deficits in verbal short-term memory but not in any other memory component. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of support for learning.
19372213	doi: 10.1093/aje/kwp059	Birth defects in children with autism spectrum disorders: a population-based, nested case-control study.	American journal of epidemiology	2009	Somer Dawson, Emma J Glasson, Glenys Dixon, Carol Bower		The causes of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are unknown, although genetic and environmental influences have been implicated. Previous studies have suggested an association with birth defects, but most investigators have not addressed associations with specific diagnostic categories of ASD. In this study, the authors investigated the associations between birth defects and autism, Asperger syndrome, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. Using Western Australian population-based linked data, the authors compared all children with ASD born in Western Australia during 1980-1995 (n = 465) with their siblings (n = 481) and population controls (n = 1,313) in a nested case-control study. The prevalence of birth defects was significantly higher in ASD cases than in population controls; this difference remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors. Odds ratios for birth defects were similar for autism (odds ratio (OR) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.0) and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3) but not for Asperger syndrome (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.1, 1.9). Birth defects in case siblings were not significantly different from those in cases and population controls. The association between birth defects and ASD may be due to underlying genetic and/or environmental factors common to both ASD and birth defects, or birth defects may predispose a child to ASD.
19369388	doi: 10.1177/1362361309103795	The not guilty verdict: psychological reactions to a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome in adulthood.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2009	Clare Punshon, Paul Skirrow, Glynis Murphy		Asperger syndrome is a relatively new diagnostic classification. A number of factors make receiving a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome in adulthood a unique experience. This study used a phenomenological approach to examine the experiences of 10 adults receiving such a diagnosis. Results suggested that six major themes were associated with receiving a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. Individuals discussed their negative life experiences and their experience of services prior to diagnosis, which led to individuals holding certain beliefs about the symptoms of Asperger syndrome. These beliefs had an effect on the formation of each individual's perceived self-identity. Participants made links between how they felt when they received the diagnosis and their current beliefs about both their ;symptoms' and themselves. Finally, participants highlighted the importance of the societal view of Asperger syndrome. The implications of these findings are reappraised in the context of previous research and the wider literature on identity formation.

Journal of proteome research	2008	Massimo Castagnola, Irene Messana, Rosanna Inzitari, Chiara Fanali, Tiziana Cabras, Alessandra Morelli, Anna Maria Pecoraro, Giovanni Neri, Maria Giulia Torrioli, Fiorella Gurrieri		RP-HPLC-ESI-MS profile of naturally occurring salivary peptides of subjects with autistic spectrum disorder [ASD; N = 27:12 with diagnosis of autism, 1 with diagnosis of Asperger, 14 with diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)] was compared to that of age-matched controls with the goal of identifying differences that could turn out to become hallmarks of at least a subgroup of ASD individuals. Phosphorylation level of four specific salivary phospho-peptides, namely statherin, histatin 1 (both, p < 0.0001) and acidic proline-rich proteins (both entire and truncated isoforms) (p < 0.005) was found significantly lower in autistic patients, with hypo-phosphorylation of at least one peptide observed in 18 ASD subjects (66%). Developmental scale assessment (Griffith or WISC-R) carried out on 14 ASD subjects highlighted a normal to borderline cognitive development in 10 of them, all included in the hypo-phosphorylated group. Phosphorylation of salivary peptides involves a Golgi casein kinase common to many organs and tissues, CNS included, whose expression seems to be synchronized during fetal development. Hypo-phosphorylation of salivary peptides suggests potential asynchronies in the phosphorylation of other secretory proteins, which could be relevant in CNS development either during embryonic development or in early infancy. These results suggest that analysis of salivary phospho-peptides might help to discriminate a considerable subgroup of ASD patients.

Topics in magnetic resonance imaging : TMRI	2008	Jean Théberge	Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Joseph's Health Care, 268 Grosvenor Street, London, Ontario, Canada. jtheberge@lawsonimaging.ca	Cerebral perfusion imaging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used in the research and clinical fields to assess the profound changes in blood flow related to ischemic events such as acute stroke, chronic steno-occlusive disease, vasospasm, and abnormal vessel formations from congenital conditions or tumoral neovascularity. With continuing improvements in the precision of MRI-based perfusion techniques, it is increasingly feasible to use this tool in the study of the subtle brain perfusion changes occurring in psychiatric illnesses. This article aims to review the existing literature on applications of perfusion MRI in psychiatric disorder and substance abuse research. The article also provides a brief introductory overview of dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI and arterial spin labeling techniques. An outlook of necessary steps to bring perfusion MRI into the realm of clinical psychiatry as a diagnostic tool is brought forth. Opportunities for research in unexplored disorders and with higher field strengths are briefly examined.
19360681	doi: 10.1002/aur.45	Face inversion effects in autism: a combined looking time and pupillometric study.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2008	Terje Falck-Ytter	Department of Psychology, Uppsala University, Box 1225, Uppsala 751 42, Sweden. terje.falck-ytter@psyk.uu.se	Previous research has found that in typically developing individuals, behavioral performance declines and electrophysiological brain responses are altered when the face is inverted. Such effects are generally attributed to disruption of configural information. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been found to show less pronounced inversion effects, a result in line with the view that featural processing of faces is enhanced in ASD. No study has determined if, or how, such local bias is reflected in the eye movements used in face observation. In this eye tracking study, looking time and pupil dilation were investigated during the presentation of upright and inverted faces in preschool children with ASD and typically developing preschoolers. On average, both children with ASD and typically developing children looked less at the face and the eye areas during inverted presentations than during upright presentations. Nevertheless, individuals with ASD had a stronger tendency than typically developing children to look at the same face features during upright and inverted presentations, which is suggestive of a local bias. Pupil dilation, reflecting increased processing load, was larger for inverted than upright faces in the ASD group only, and pupillary inversion effects were stronger in ASD than in typically developing children.
19360665	doi: 10.1002/aur.25	Mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier SLC25A12 gene is associated with autism.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2008	Joni A Turunen, Karola Rehnström, Helena Kilpinen, Mikko Kuokkanen, Elli Kempas, Tero Ylisaukko-Oja		Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) within Mitochondrial Aspartate/Glutamate Carrier SLC25A12 gene have recently shown to be strongly associated with autism. Here, we attempted to replicate this finding in two separate Finnish samples with autism spectrum disorders. Family-based association analysis of two SNPs, rs2056202 and rs2292813, previously shown to be associated with autism was performed in two samples with different phenotypic characteristics. The samples included 97 families with strictly defined autism and 29 extended families with Asperger syndrome (AS). We detected association at rs2292813 (FBAT, P=0.0018) in the Finnish autism sample. In, addition other family-based analysis methods supported this finding. By contrast, analysis of the AS sample yielded no evidence for association. This study shows further support that genetic variants within SLC25A12 gene contribute to the etiology of autism.
19360664	doi: 10.1002/aur.19	Detecting changes in naturalistic scenes: contextual inconsistency does not influence spontaneous attention in high-functioning people with autism spectrum disorder.	Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2008	Eva Loth, Juan Carlos Gómez, Francesca Happé		"Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are often reported to be good at detecting minute changes in the environment. This study tested two factors in this phenomenon; detail-focus and reduced top-down influence of scene-schema expectations on spontaneous attention to visual scene elements. Using a change blindness paradigm, adults with ASD and matched typically developing (TD) adults were presented with images of naturalistic scenes (e.g., living room). Scene changes involved three types of object substitution: an object was replaced with (i) an unexpected scene-unrelated object, (ii) a scene-related object of a different basic-level category, (iii) or a different exemplar of the original object category. Top-down effects of scene-schema expectations should render scene-unrelated (i) substitutions easiest to recognize; detail focus should increase detection of exemplar changes. The TD group showed the expected condition effects, detecting scene-unrelated substitutions significantly better than both types of scene-related changes. By contrast, the ASD group showed no condition effect, and was only significantly slower and less accurate than the TD group in detecting scene-unrelated objects. These findings suggest reduced influence of schematic expectations on spontaneous attention in individuals with ASD. Together with other factors, this may contribute to the tendency to notice ""irrelevant"" changes in the environment."

Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research	2008	Justin H G Williams	Department of Child Health, University of Aberdeen Medical School, Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital, Aberdeen, UK. justin.williams@abdn.ac.uk	"Mirror neuron system dysfunction may underlie a self-other matching impairment, which has previously been suggested to account for autism. Embodied Cognition Theory, which proposes that action provides a foundation for cognition has lent further credence to these ideas. The hypotheses of a self-other matching deficit and impaired mirror neuron function in autism have now been well supported by studies employing a range of methodologies. However, underlying mechanisms require further exploration to explain how mirror neurons may be involved in attentional and mentalizing processes. Impairments in self-other matching and mirror neuron function are not necessarily inextricably linked and it seems possible that different sub-populations of mirror neurons, located in several regions, contribute differentially to social cognitive functions. It is hypothesized that mirror neuron coding for action-direction may be required for developing attentional sensitivity to self-directed actions, and consequently for person-oriented, stimulus-driven attention. Mirror neuron networks may vary for different types of social learning such as ""automatic"" imitation and imitation learning. Imitation learning may be more reliant on self-other comparison processes (based on mirror neurons) that identify differences as well as similarities between actions. Differential connectivity with the amygdala-orbitofrontal system may also be important. This could have implications for developing ""theory of mind,"" with intentional self-other comparison being relevant to meta-representational abilities, and ""automatic"" imitation being more relevant to empathy. While it seems clear that autism is associated with impaired development of embodied aspects of cognition, the ways that mirror neurons contribute to these brain-behavior links are likely to be complex."

White-matter maldevelopment is associated with autism and disconnectivity theories of autism are compelling. However, it is unknown whether children with ASP and HFA have distinct white-matter abnormalities.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Sophie E Lind, Dermot M Bowler		"This study investigated semantic and episodic memory in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), using a task which assessed recognition and self-other source memory. Children with ASD showed undiminished recognition memory but significantly diminished source memory, relative to age- and verbal ability-matched comparison children. Both children with and without ASD showed an ""enactment effect"", demonstrating significantly better recognition and source memory for self-performed actions than other-person-performed actions. Within the comparison group, theory-of-mind (ToM) task performance was significantly correlated with source memory, specifically for other-person-performed actions (after statistically controlling for verbal ability). Within the ASD group, ToM task performance was not significantly correlated with source memory (after controlling for verbal ability). Possible explanations for these relations between source memory and ToM are considered."

The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry	2010	Nahit Motavalli Mukaddes, Rouzbeh Fateh		The present study aimed to provide clinical data regarding co-morbidity of psychiatric disorders in individuals diagnosed with Asperger's disorder (AD). This study included 37 individuals (32 male, five female, mean age: 10.9+/-4.5 years) diagnosed with AD. Psychiatric comorbidity was assessed using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Age Children - Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS - PL). Ninety-four percent of participants had at least one additional psychiatric disorder. The most common were anxiety disorders (54%), disruptive behavioural disorders (48%), and mood disorders (37%). The results of this study highlight the need for detailed assessment of additional psychiatric disorders in this population.

19338720	doi: 10.1348/174866407X272448	Asperger syndrome: how does it relate to non-verbal learning disability?	Journal of neuropsychology	2009	B Ryburn, V Anderson, R Wales		The syndrome of non-verbal learning disabilities (NLD) is associated with prominent non-verbal deficits such as reduced perceptual and spatial abilities, against a background of relatively intact verbal abilities. Asperger syndrome is one of the several developmental disorders for which Byron Rourke has claimed that almost all the signs and symptoms of NLD are present. This study investigated the claim utilizing a battery of neuropsychological tests that were found to be sensitive to NLD in the original learning disordered populations used to describe the syndrome. Children aged between 8 and 14 were recruited to form two groups: (1) children with Asperger syndrome (N=14) and (2) normal healthy schoolchildren (N=20). By contrast to the main principle outlined in the NLD model, children with Asperger syndrome did not display a relative difficulty with spatial- or problem-solving tasks; indeed, they displayed significantly higher performance on some non-verbal tasks in comparison with verbal tasks. It was only in relation to their high levels of psychosocial and interpersonal difficulties, which are also predicted on the basis of their psychiatric diagnosis, that the children with Asperger syndrome were clearly consistent with the NLD model in this study. These results raise questions about the relevance of the syndrome of NLD for children with Asperger syndrome.

There has been limited research into its utility for children with Asperger's syndrome (AS). These children often present with motor difficulties, although these are not required for diagnosis of the syndrome. A recent study found that children with AS were able to use the CO-OP framework to enhance their performance of motor-based goals.

Bedrich Smetana's autobiographical string quartet ends with the musical equivalent of tinnitus in the fourth movement, rendering the youthful and passionate themes of earlier movements moot as the piece ends depicting his ultimately fatal disease, neurosyphilis. Dmitri Shostakovich survived the censorship of Joseph Stalin's apparatchiks but suffered a prolonged form of paralysis attributable to slowly progressive motor neuron disease, although the viola sonata he wrote on his deathbed has become standard repertoire. Glenn Gould was a hypochondriacal pianist with obsessive-compulsive disorder and suspected Asperger syndrome. Vissarion Shebalin and (Ira) Randall Thompson had strokes followed by aphasia without amusia. Domenico Scarlatti provides an example of how even great composers must alter their technical expectations depending upon the skills and body habitus of their chief patrons. The focal dystonia afflicting Leon Fleisher and Gary Graffman catalyzed the discipline of performing arts medicine.

Our ability to react to change is modulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, a feature of which is a dramatic increase in cortisol upon waking, the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR). This study examined whether the CAR was evident in 20 adolescent males with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and 18 age-matched typically developing (TD) controls (aged 11-16). Whilst a significant CAR was evidenced in the TD control group, this was not the case for those with AS. A normal diurnal decrease in cortisol, however, was evident in both groups. The implication that individuals with AS may have an impaired response to change in their environment due to a refractory HPA axis is discussed.

Overall, distribution of diagnoses was influenced by a secular time trend factor; other significant factors included ethnicity, white race, geographic location, urbanicity, and initial evaluator. Since 2001, most initial diagnoses of AD and AS have remained steady while 'PDD' and PDD-NOS have decreased. 'ASD' diagnoses have increased, especially among school-based teams; AS diagnoses also increased uniquely among these evaluators. Findings from this study suggest that current diagnostic guidelines may not be meeting all community evaluator needs.

A retrospective review of plasma zinc, serum copper and zinc/copper was performed on data from 230 children with autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder-NOS and Asperger's syndrome. The entire cohort's mean zinc level was 77.2 microg dl(-1), mean copper level was 131.5 microg dl(-1), and mean Zn/Cu was 0.608, which was below the 0.7 cut-off of the lowest 2.5% of healthy children. The plasma zinc/serum copper ratio may be a biomarker of heavy metal, particularly mercury, toxicity in children with ASDs.

Psychopathology	2009	S Bejerot, E Mörtberg		Social phobia and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) share several similarities: both are categorized as anxiety disorders, avoidant personality disorder and depression are common in both, they have a similar age of onset and course, and both disorders respond to treatments with serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive behavioural therapy. However, OCD and social phobia differ in respect to their relation to autism spectrum disorders (ASD; i.e. Asperger's syndrome, autism, pervasive disorder not otherwise specified). Findings that suggest a link between OCD and ASD have no parallel in social phobia. Moreover, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid and schizotypal personality disorders are prevalent in OCD and in ASD, but not in social phobia. Individuals with ASD are known to be frequent targets of bullying. We hypothesised that individuals with autistic traits would have been frequent targets for bullies during their childhood, as opposed to people without such traits.

The current study investigated the metabolites in the methionine cycle, the transsulphuration pathway, folate, vitamin B(12) and the C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene in three groups of children diagnosed with AD (n= 15), AS (n= 5) and PDD-NOS (n= 19) and their age- and sex-matched controls (n= 25). No metabolic disturbances were seen in the AS patients, while in the AD and PDD-NOS groups, lower plasma levels of methionine (P= 0.01 and P= 0.03, respectively) and alpha-aminobutyrate were observed (P= 0.01 and P= 0.001, respectively). Only in the AD group, plasma cysteine (P= 0.02) and total blood glutathione (P= 0.02) were found to be reduced. Although there was a trend towards lower levels of serine, glycine, N, N-dimethylglycine in AD patients, the plasma levels of these metabolites as well as the levels of homocysteine and cystathionine were not statistically different in any of the ASDs groups. The serum levels of vitamin B(12) and folate were in the normal range. The results of the MTHFR gene analysis showed a normal distribution of the C677T polymorphism in children with ASDs, but the frequency of the 677T allele was slightly more prevalent in AD patients. Our study indicates a possible role for the alterations in one carbon metabolism in the pathophysiology of ASDs and provides, for the first time, preliminary evidence for metabolic and genetic differences between clinical subtypes of ASDs.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Chérif P Sahyoun, Isabelle Soulières, John W Belliveau, Laurent Mottron, Maria Mody		We investigated linguistic and visuospatial processing during pictorial reasoning in high-functioning autism (HFA), Asperger's syndrome (ASP), and age and IQ-matched typically developing participants (CTRL), using three conditions designed to differentially engage linguistic mediation or visuospatial processing (visuospatial, V; semantic, S; visuospatial + semantic, V + S). The three groups did not differ in accuracy, but showed different response time profiles. ASP and CTRL participants were fastest on V + S, amenable to both linguistic and nonlinguistic mediation, whereas HFA participants were equally fast on V and V + S, where visuospatial strategies were available, and slowest on S. HFA participants appeared to favor visuospatial over linguistic mediation. The results support the use of linguistic versus visuospatial tasks for characterizing subtypes on the autism spectrum.
19255803	doi: 10.1007/s00787-009-0003-1	Autism spectrum disorders in children and adolescents with Moebius sequence.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2009	Wolfgang Briegel, Martina Schimek, Inge Kamp-Becker, Christina Hofmann, K Otfried Schwab		Moebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. A strong association of Moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groups. The primary caregivers of all children and adolescents with Moebius sequence aged 6-17 years known to the German Moebius foundation were anonymously asked to complete two screening measures of ASD [Behavior and Communication Questionnaire (VSK); Marburger Asperger's Syndrome Rating Scale (MBAS)]. For those who reached the cut-off for ASD, well standardized diagnostic instruments (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised, Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, WISC-III, and Kinder-DIPS) should be administered. Minimal diagnostic criteria for Moebius sequence were congenital facial weakness (uni- or bilateral) and impairment of ocular abduction (uni- or bilateral). Familiar cases should be excluded. The primary caregivers of 35/46 children and adolescents (18 males, 17 females, mean age 11.5 years) sent back completed questionnaires, but only 27 subjects met inclusion criteria. According to the primary caregivers, none of these subjects showed mental retardation. Two probands (both males 9 and 16 years old) reached the cut-off of the MBAS whereas the results of the VSK did not indicate ASDs in any of the patients. The 9 year old boy could be examined personally and did not meet diagnostic criteria of ASD. ASDs might be not as frequent as reported in previous studies on patients with Moebius sequence, at least not in patients without mental retardation.

Biological psychiatry	2009	Liisa Tomppo, William Hennah, Päivi Lahermo, Anu Loukola, Annamari Tuulio-Henriksson, Jaana Suvisaari, Timo Partonen, Jesper Ekelund, Jouko Lönnqvist, Leena Peltonen		Disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is currently one of the most interesting candidate genes for major mental illness, having been demonstrated to associate with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, autism, and Asperger's syndrome. We have previously reported a DISC1 haplotype, HEP3, and an NDE1 spanning tag haplotype to associate to schizophrenia in Finnish schizophrenia families. Because both DISC1 and NDE1 display association in our study sample, we hypothesized that other genes interacting with DISC1 might also have a role in the etiology of schizophrenia.

19244857		Balancing Newton's mind: his singular behaviour and his madness of 1692-93.	Notes and records of the Royal Society of London	2008	Milo Keynes		Newton grew up with a vulnerable and eccentric character besides having a low self-esteem, and he was someone who only uncommonly developed any close relationships. On review it is argued that his distrust and suspicions of others, and the fear that he might be harmed by criticism and his discoveries stolen, followed from his mother's separation from him in childhood and not, as has been claimed, from the developmental disorder of Asperger's syndrome. It is further firmly argued that his 'madness' of 1692 and 1693 was due to mercury poisoning from his alchemical experiments and not to clinical depression.

19234776	doi: 10.1007/s10803-009-0707-6	Brief report: biochemical correlates of clinical impairment in high functioning autism and Asperger's disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Natalia M Kleinhans, Todd Richards, Kurt E Weaver, Olivia Liang, Geraldine Dawson, Elizabeth Aylward		Amygdala dysfunction has been proposed as a critical contributor to social impairment in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The current study investigated biochemical abnormalities in the amygdala in 20 high functioning adults with autistic disorder or Asperger's disorder and 19 typically developing adults matched on age and IQ. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to measure N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), creatine/phosphocreatine (Cre), choline/choline containing compounds (Cho), and Myoinositol (mI) in the right and left amygdala. There were no significant between-group differences in any of the metabolites. However, NAA and Cre levels were significantly correlated to clinical ratings on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. This suggests that altered metabolite levels in the amygdala may be associated with a more severe early developmental course in ASD.

Clinical psychology review	2009	Susan W White, Donald Oswald, Thomas Ollendick, Lawrence Scahill		Anxiety and poor stress management are common concerns in clinical samples of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Anxiety may worsen during adolescence, as young people face an increasingly complex social milieu and often become more aware of their differences and interpersonal difficulties. This review summarizes the state of research on the prevalence, phenomenology, and treatment of anxiety in youth with autism and related conditions such as Asperger's Disorder. Using search words autism, asperger(s), or pervasive developmental disorder and anxiety or anxious to find reports published between 1990 and 2008, this review identified 40 papers. The results of the review suggest that anxiety, whether measured categorically or dimensionally, is indeed common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and may be a source of additional morbidity. The assessment of anxiety disorders in ASD should be conducted using multiple informants and modalities, as children with ASD often do not display age-typical symptoms of anxiety. To date, relatively few controlled intervention studies using well-characterized samples have been conducted despite preliminary evidence for efficacy of select pharmacological and psychosocial approaches. Recommendations for future applied research are presented and clinical implications are explored.
19219649	doi: 10.1007/s00787-008-0708-6	Block design reconstruction skills: not a good candidate for an endophenotypic marker in autism research.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2009	Maretha de Jonge, Chantal Kemner, Fabienne Naber, Herman van Engeland		Superior performance on block design tasks is reported in autistic individuals, although it is not consistently found in high-functioning individuals or individuals with Asperger Syndrome. It is assumed to reflect weak central coherence: an underlying cognitive deficit, which might also be part of the genetic makeup of the disorder. We assessed block design reconstruction skills in high-functioning individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) from multi-incidence families and in their parents. Performance was compared to relevant matched control groups. We used a task that was assumed to be highly sensitive to subtle performance differences. We did not find individuals with ASD to be significantly faster on this task than the matched control group, not even when the difference between reconstruction time of segmented and pre-segmented designs was compared. However, we found individuals with ASD to make fewer errors during the process of reconstruction which might indicate some dexterity in mental segmentation. However, parents of individuals with ASD did not perform better on the task than control parents. Therefore, based on our data, we conclude that mental segmentation ability as measured with a block design reconstruction task is not a neurocognitive marker or endophenotype useful in genetic studies.

Pediatric research	2009	Eric Fombonne	Department of Psychiatry, Montreal Children's Hospital of the McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. eric.fombonne@mcgill.ca	This article reviews the results of 43 studies published since 1966 that provided estimates for the prevalence of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), including autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, PDD not otherwise specified, and childhood disintegrative disorder. The prevalence of autistic disorder has increased in recent surveys and current estimates of prevalence are around 20/10,000, whereas the prevalence for PDD not otherwise specified is around 30/10,000 in recent surveys. Prevalence of Asperger disorder is much lower than that for autistic disorder and childhood disintegrative disorder is a very rare disorder with a prevalence of about 2/100,000. Combined all together, recent studies that have examined the whole spectrum of PDDs have consistently provided estimates in the 60-70/10,000 range, making PDD one of the most frequent childhood neurodevelopmental disorders. The meaning of the increase in prevalence in recent decades is reviewed. There is evidence that the broadening of the concept, the expansion of diagnostic criteria, the development of services, and improved awareness of the condition have played a major role in explaining this increase, although it cannot be ruled out that other factors might have also contributed to that trend.
19215988	doi: 10.1016/j.psychres.2007.11.015	Neuropsychological mechanisms of Digit Symbol Substitution Test impairment in Asperger Disorder.	Psychiatry research	2009	Roni Yoran-Hegesh, Semion Kertzman, Tali Vishne, Abraham Weizman, Moshe Kotler		Our aim was to investigate the neurocognitive mechanisms recruited by adolescents with Asperger Disorder (AD), in comparison to controls, and to detect the underlying mechanisms during the complex information processing required for the performance of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Male adolescents (n=23; mean age 15.1+/-3.6 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of AD were compared with a normal male control group with similar demographic characteristics (n=43; mean age: 15.1+/-3.6 years). A computerized neurocognitive battery was administered and included: Inspection Time (IT), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), Simple Reaction Time (SRT), Choice Reaction Time (CRT), Digit Running task (DRT), Stroop test and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Adolescents with AD performed significantly worse than controls on the DSST. This impaired DSST performance was related to cognitive mechanisms different from those employed by normal controls. Motor slowness and inability to deal with increased amounts of information affected the performance of the AD group, while shifting of attention was the limiting factor in the controls. Both groups were similarly dependent on response selection. This study demonstrated differences in performance in complex cognitive tasks between adolescents with AD and normal controls that may be related to differences in neurocognitive mechanisms underlying information processing. Future neuroimaging studies are needed to clarify the neural network involved in the differences in cognitive performance between AD subjects and normal controls.
19214283		Autistic enterocolitis: fact or fiction?	Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie	2009	Polymnia Galiatsatos, Adrian Gologan, Esther Lamoureux		Autism spectrum disorder refers to syndromes of varying severity, typified by impaired social interactions, communicative delays and restricted, repetitive behaviours and interests. The prevalence of autism spectrum disorders has been on the rise, while the etiology remains unclear and most likely multifactorial. There have been several reports of a link between autism and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Endoscopy trials have demonstrated a higher prevalence of nonspecific colitis, lymphoid hyperplasia and focally enhanced gastritis compared with controls. Postulated mechanisms include aberrant immune responses to some dietary proteins, abnormal intestinal permeability and unfavourable gut microflora. Two autism spectrum disorder patients with chronic intestinal symptoms and abnormal endoscopic findings are described, followed by a review of this controversial topic.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Iris J Oosterling, Sophie H Swinkels, Rutger Jan van der Gaag, Janne C Visser, Claudine Dietz, Jan K Buitelaar		Several instruments have been developed to screen for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in high-risk populations. However, few studies compare different instruments in one sample. Data were gathered from the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, Social Communication Questionnaire, Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales-Developmental Profile, Infant-Toddler Checklist and key items of the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers in 238 children (mean age = 29.6 months, SD = 6.4) at risk for ASD. Discriminative properties are compared in the whole sample and in two age groups separately (8-24 months and 25-44 months). No instrument or individual item shows satisfying power in discriminating ASD from non-ASD, but pros and cons of instruments and items are discussed and directions for future research are proposed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	David M Williams, Francesca Happé		The task used most widely to assess recognition of false belief in self and others is the 'Smarties' unexpected contents task. Amongst individuals with and without autism, the Self and Other-person test questions of this task are of an equivalent level of difficulty. However, a potential confound with this task may allow the Self test question to be passed without false belief competence. Three groups of participants (with autism, developmental disability and typical development) undertook a new unexpected contents task which did not suffer from this confound. The main finding was that participants with autism performed significantly less well on the Self test question than the Other-person test question on this new task. Individuals with autism may have greater difficulty representing their own beliefs than the beliefs of other people.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Sanna Kuusikko, Helena Haapsamo, Eira Jansson-Verkasalo, Tuula Hurtig, Marja-Leena Mattila, Hanna Ebeling, Katja Jussila, Sven Bölte, Irma Moilanen		We examined upper facial basic emotion recognition in 57 subjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (M = 13.5 years) and 33 typically developing controls (M = 14.3 years) by using a standardized computer-aided measure (The Frankfurt Test and Training of Facial Affect Recognition, FEFA). The ASD group scored lower than controls on the total scores of FEFA and perceived ambiguous stimuli more often as a negative emotion. The older ASD group (> or =12 years) performed better than the younger ASD group (<12 years) on the blended emotions of FEFA. The results support the findings that individuals with ASD have difficulties in emotion recognition. However, older subjects with ASD seem to have better skills than younger subjects with ASD.

19195194		[Neuroanatomical basis of pervasive developmental disorders and its pathogenesis].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2008			"Since recent literature has argued to give up a single explanation covering diverse symptom defining autism-spectrum disorder (ASD), our study focuses on deficits in social cognition as the target of phenotype in searching cause for ASD. First study revealed that the gray matter volume reductions in several regions important for social cognition were common to monozygotic twins with Asperger's syndrome as compared with healthy matched controls. The findings suggest a contribution of shared genetic factors to underlying the structural abnormalities in ASD. Second study showed that the young healthy females showed greater cooperativeness as well as larger relative global and regional gray matter volumes than the matched males, particularly in the social-brain regions including posterior inferior frontal and anterior medial prefrontal cortices. Moreover, specifically in females, higher cooperativeness was tightly coupled with the larger relative total gray matter volume and more specifically with the regional gray matter volume in most of the regions revealing larger in female sex-dimorphism. These results suggest that sexually-dimorphic factors may affect the neurodevelopment of these ""social-brain"" regions, leading to higher cooperativeness in females. The findings may also have an implication for the pathophysiology of autism; characterized by severe dysfunction in social reciprocity, abnormalities in social-brain, and disproportionately low probability in females. Third study showed a gender specific relationship between a polymorphism of oxytocin-receptor gene and regional gray matter volume of inferior frontal gyrus in healthy young adults. Forth study demonstrates the correlation between smaller-than normal volume of posterior inferior frontal gyrus and worse function of social communication in the males with ASD compared with matched controls. Furthermore, we would like to discuss the possibility of future study examining the relationship between oxytocin-induced enhancement of social cognition and polymorphisms of genes encoding oxytocin-related molecules using neuroimaging as endophenotypes."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Stephen M Kanne, Anna M Abbacchi, John N Constantino		The present study examines co-occurring psychiatric syndromes in a well-characterized sample of youths with autism spectrum disorders (ASD; n = 177) and their siblings (n = 148), reported independently by parents and teachers. In ASD, parents reported substantial comorbidity with affective (26%), anxiety (25%), attentional (25%), conduct (16%), oppositional (15%), and somatic problems (6%). Teachers reported a much lower prevalence. Autistic severity scores for children with ASD exhibited moderate correlations with general psychopathology within- but not across-informants, whereas, sibling correlations were significant both within- and across-informants. Results support the role of environmental context in psychiatric symptom expression in children affected by autism and suggest that informant discrepancies may more provide critical cues for these children via specific environmental modifications.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2009	Gael I Orsmond, Hsin-Yu Kuo, Marsha Mailick Seltzer		We investigated sibling relationships and wellbeing in adolescents and adults with a sibling with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Adolescents engaged in more shared activities than did adults. Adolescents reported greater social support, greater use of emotion-focused coping strategies, and less use of problem-focused coping than adults. In adulthood, females with a sister with ASD reported the most positive affect in the sibling relationship and men with a sister with ASD the least. Adolescents engaged in more shared activities and reported more positive affect in their sibling relationship when their sibling with ASD had fewer behavior problems; greater use of problem-focused coping buffered the negative effects of behavior problems on sibling engagement. For adults, more shared activities were observed when the sibling with ASD was younger in age and had fewer behavior problems; greater positive affect in sibling relationships was predicted by greater parental support.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2009	Fiona Zandt, Margot Prior, Michael Kyrios		In order to examine hypothesized underlying neurocognitive processes in repetitive behaviour, children and adolescents (7-16 years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were compared on a range of executive function (EF) measures. Performance on neuropsychological tests assessing executive functioning showed a trend for children with ASD to perform poorly on tasks requiring generation of multiple responses, while children with OCD tended to demonstrate impairments on a task requiring inhibition. Parental ratings on a questionnaire measure of EF indicated impairments in both groups relative to controls. Relationships between questionnaire and performance measures of EF were generally weak. There was some limited support for a relationship between EF and repetitive behaviour, but effects tended to be small and variable across groups and measures.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2009	Rory Allen, Elizabeth Hill, Pam Heaton		Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 high-functioning adults on the autism spectrum, in order to examine the nature of their personal experiences of music. Consistent with the literature on typically developing people's engagement with music, the analysis showed that most participants exploit music for a wide range of purposes in the cognitive, emotional and social domains, including mood management, personal development and social inclusion. However, in contrast to typically developing people, the ASD group's descriptions of mood states reflected a greater reliance on internally focused (arousal) rather than externally focused (emotive) language.

Brain : a journal of neurology	2009	Sam J Gilbert, Julia D I Meuwese, Karren J Towgood, Christopher D Frith, Paul W Burgess		Multi-voxel pattern analyses have proved successful in 'decoding' mental states from fMRI data, but have not been used to examine brain differences associated with atypical populations. We investigated a group of 16 (14 males) high-functioning participants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and 16 non-autistic control participants (12 males) performing two tasks (spatial/verbal) previously shown to activate medial rostral prefrontal cortex (mrPFC). Each task manipulated: (i) attention towards perceptual versus self-generated information and (ii) reflection on another person's mental state ('mentalizing'versus 'non-mentalizing') in a 2 x 2 design. Behavioral performance and group-level fMRI results were similar between groups. However, multi-voxel similarity analyses revealed strong differences. In control participants, the spatial distribution of activity generalized significantly between task contexts (spatial/verbal) when examining the same function (attention/mentalizing) but not when comparing different functions. This pattern was disrupted in the ASD group, indicating abnormal functional specialization within mrPFC, and demonstrating the applicability of multi-voxel pattern analysis to investigations of atypical populations.

In addition, given that ASD now affects 1 in 150 children, it is probable that nurses in a variety of settings, at all practice levels, will encounter children with ASD. Nurses need to be able to support families, educate parents, manage basic issues relevant to ASD, and advocate for these children and their families.

Given the prevalence of this disorder, there is a high probability that pediatric nurses will care for a child with ASD, regardless of the setting in which they work. Children with ASD traverse the primary care outpatient setting, schools, subspecialty clinics, and inpatient units. A basic understanding of the current issues regarding prevalence and etiology, coupled with knowledge of the core features of ASD, will help pediatric nurses in all settings and at various practice levels better care for these children.

Child: care, health and development	2008	T Epstein, J Saltzman-Benaiah, A O'Hare, J C Goll, S Tuck		Studies have shown an increased level of stress in parents of autistic children relative to parents of non-autistic children. Few studies have examined parenting stress specifically within the Asperger Syndrome (AS) population. Children with AS often have associated difficulties such as sensory sensitivities and problems with executive functioning (i.e. planning, inhibiting, shifting set). This study was designed to study parenting stress as well as to consider the relationship between parenting stress and some of the associated difficulties of AS. More specifically, the aims of this study were to demonstrate the following: that, as a group, parents of children with AS would report elevated levels of parenting stress, a finding which may be more significant for mothers than fathers; that children with AS show impairment in executive functioning as well as heightened sensory sensitivity according to parent report; that parent report of their child's demanding characteristics would be positively associated with their self-reported levels of parenting stress.

International journal of prisoner health	2009	J Talbot	Prison Reform Trust, 15 Northburgh Street, London, UK.	No One Knows is concerned about people with learning disabilities and difficulties who get into trouble with the police and who enter the criminal justice system. The terms 'learning difficulties' and 'learning difficulties' are often used interchangeably to describe people with an intellectual disability, excluding those who, for example, have dyslexia or Asperger syndrome. No One Knows, however, has adopted a more inclusive approach and has included in its remit offenders with learning disabilities as defined by the World Health Organization as well as those with a broader range of learning difficulties. Although there is some discrepancy on prevalence, it is clear that high numbers of people with learning disabilities and difficulties are caught up in the criminal justice system. Once in the criminal justice system it is unlikely that an individual with learning disabilities or difficulties will be identified or that their support needs will be met. This causes difficulties for the individual concerned and for the staff who work with them, who receive little or no training for working with this group of people. The question of whether people with learning disabilities (meaning intellectual disabilities) should be diverted from the criminal justice system is considered.

Journal of family psychology : JFP : journal of the Division of Family Psychology of the American Psychological Association (Division 43)	2008	Colin G Pottie, Kathleen M Ingram		This study used a repeated daily measurement design to examine the direct and moderating effects of coping on daily psychological distress and well-being in parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Twice weekly over a 12-week period, 93 parents provided reports of their daily stress, coping responses, and end-of-day mood. Multilevel modeling analyses identified 5 coping responses (e.g., seeking support, positive reframing) that predicted increased daily positive mood and 4 (e.g., escape, withdrawal) that were associated with decreased positive mood. Similarly, 2 coping responses were associated with decreased daily negative mood and 5 predicted increased negative mood. The moderating effects of gender and the 11 coping responses were also examined. Gender did not moderate the daily coping?mood relationship, however 3 coping responses (emotional regulation, social support, and worrying) were found to moderate the daily stress?mood relationship. Additionally, ASD symptomatology, and time since an ASD diagnosis were not found to predict daily parental mood. This study is perhaps the first to identify coping responses that enhance daily well-being and mitigate daily distress in parents of children with ASD.

Journal of attention disorders	2009	Mandy Roy, Wolfgang Dillo, Svenja Bessling, Hinderk M Emrich, Martin D Ohlmeier		Aspergers Syndrome can present as comorbid with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Very few cases of the assessment and treatment of this comorbidity in adulthood are described in the research literature.
19084028	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.11.015	Verbal fluency in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome.	Neuropsychologia	2009	Annelies Spek, Tjeerd Schatorjé, Evert Scholte, Ina van Berckelaer-Onnes		The semantic and phonemic fluency performance of adults with high functioning autism (HFA), Asperger syndrome and a neurotypical control group were compared. All participants were matched for age and verbal ability. Results showed that the participants with HFA were significantly impaired in their performance of both semantic fluency tasks and the phonemic fluency task using the letter M. The Asperger group was only impaired in their performance of the semantic fluency task 'professions'. The social components of the 'professions' task may have influenced the performance of the two disorder groups for this subtest negatively. The fluency deficits could not be attributed to a lack of the use of strategies or to difficulties in switching between strategies. The impairment in two of the three verbal fluency subtests in the HFA group can be attributed to the relatively low processing speed found in this group.

19063905	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.11.011	Defeasible reasoning in high-functioning adults with autism: evidence for impaired exception-handling.	Neuropsychologia	2009	Judith Pijnacker, Bart Geurts, Michiel van Lambalgen, Cornelis C Kan, Jan K Buitelaar, Peter Hagoort		While autism is one of the most intensively researched psychiatric disorders, little is known about reasoning skills of people with autism. The focus of this study was on defeasible inferences, that is inferences that can be revised in the light of new information. We used a behavioral task to investigate (a) conditional reasoning and (b) the suppression of conditional inferences in high-functioning adults with autism. In the suppression task a possible exception was made salient which could prevent a conclusion from being drawn. We predicted that the autism group would have difficulties dealing with such exceptions because they require mental flexibility to adjust to the context, which is often impaired in autism. The findings confirm our hypothesis that high-functioning adults with autism have a specific difficulty with exception-handling during reasoning. It is suggested that defeasible reasoning is also involved in other cognitive domains. Implications for neural underpinnings of reasoning and autism are discussed.

Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	2009	A-A S Meilleur, E Fombonne		As part of the pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), there is a subgroup of individuals reported to have a different onset of symptom appearance consisting of an apparently normal early development, followed by a loss of verbal and/or non-verbal skills prior to 2 years of age. This study aims at comparing the symptomatology of children who displayed a regression and often an associated intellectual disability through investigation of two types of loss, namely language and other skill regression.
19052858	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0661-8	Pragmatic inferences in high-functioning adults with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Judith Pijnacker, Peter Hagoort, Jan Buitelaar, Jan-Pieter Teunisse, Bart Geurts		"Although people with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) often have severe problems with pragmatic aspects of language, little is known about their pragmatic reasoning. We carried out a behavioral study on high-functioning adults with autistic disorder (n = 11) and Asperger syndrome (n = 17) and matched controls (n = 28) to investigate whether they are capable of deriving scalar implicatures, which are generally considered to be pragmatic inferences. Participants were presented with underinformative sentences like ""Some sparrows are birds"". This sentence is logically true, but pragmatically inappropriate if the scalar implicature ""Not all sparrows are birds"" is derived. The present findings indicate that the combined ASD group was just as likely as controls to derive scalar implicatures, yet there was a difference between participants with autistic disorder and Asperger syndrome, suggesting a potential differentiation between these disorders in pragmatic reasoning. Moreover, our results suggest that verbal intelligence is a constraint for task performance in autistic disorder but not in Asperger syndrome."

Emotion, space and society	2008	Sara Ryan, Ulla Räisänen	DIPEx Health Experiences Research Unit, Department of Primary Health Care, University of Oxford, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford OX3 7RF, UK.	"This study explores the experiences of people with Asperger syndrome (AS) from a sociological perspective using the theoretical approaches of ethnomethodology and symbolic interactionism. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 people with AS and three key themes of feeling different, trying to fit in and safe spaces are considered here. We suggest that people with AS develop a different symbolic capacity to most people and have difficulties in making sense of social encounters. While these difficulties can be overcome, to some degree, by developing strategies to try to fit in, this learning remains at a superficial level and is not internalised through the process of socialisation. Without being able to derive a firm sense of reality from spontaneous involvement in social encounters, participants feel ""unruled, unreal and anomic"" (Goffman, 1967: 135) and experience intense autistic emotion (Davidson, 2007a,b)."
19029670		School-to-work transition and Asperger Syndrome.	Work (Reading, Mass.)	2008	Kristin K Higgins, Lynn C Koch, Erica M Boughfman, Courtney Vierstra		Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by underdeveloped social and communication skills. Despite the fact that most individuals with AS have average to above average cognitive abilities, characteristics of the disorder can cause extreme difficulties in these two domains. While increased attention has been given to the developmental characteristics and educational support needs of children with AS, few studies have focused on the psychosocial and vocational characteristics of emerging adults with AS and the supports they need to succeed in the workplace. This article examines the school-to-work transition of individuals with AS. Psychosocial and vocational characteristics of AS are identified and potential work challenges for these individuals are discussed. The article concludes with specific recommendations for facilitating successful school-to-work transitions for consumers with AS.

Journal of abnormal child psychology	2009	Koa Whittingham, Kate Sofronoff, Jeanie Sheffield, Matthew R Sanders		Whilst the Triple P Positive Parenting Program has a large evidence base (Sanders, Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review 2:71-90, 1999; Sanders, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology 68:624-640, 2000) and preliminary evidence indicates that Stepping Stones Triple P is also efficacious (Roberts, Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology, 35(2):180-193, 2006), to date Stepping Stones has not been evaluated with the ASD population. Fifty-nine families with a child with ASD aged between 2 and 9 participated in this randomized controlled trial. The results demonstrate significant improvements in parental reports of child behaviour and parenting styles with the treatment effects for child behaviour, parental over reactivity and parental verbosity being maintained at follow-up 6 months later. Further, the results suggest significant improvements in parental satisfaction and conflict about parenting as well as a sleeper effect for parental efficacy. The results indicate that Stepping Stones Triple P is a promising intervention for parents of children with ASD. Limitations and future research are also addressed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Dermot M Bowler, Sebastian B Gaigg, John M Gardiner		The Task Support Hypothesis (TSH, Bowler et al. Neuropsychologia 35:65-70 1997) states that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show better memory when test procedures provide support for retrieval. The present study aimed to see whether this principle also applied at encoding. Twenty participants with high-functioning ASD and 20 matched comparison participants studied arrays of 112 words over four trials. Words were arranged either under hierarchically embedded category headings (e.g. Instruments-String-Plucked-Violin) or randomly. Both groups showed similar overall recall and better recall for the hierarchically organised words. However, the ASD participants made less use of information about relations between words and more use of item-specific information in their recall, confirming earlier reports of relational difficulties in this population.
19018836	doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2008.03172.x	Prevalence of psychopathology in childhood epilepsy: categorical and dimensional measures.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2009	David W Dunn, Joan K Austin, Susan M Perkins		Few studies have utilized both categorical and dimensional measures of psychopathology in children with epilepsy. We evaluated 173 children (88 males, 85 females; mean age 11.7y [SD 1.8]; range 9-14y) who had epilepsy (generalized 36%, partial 61%) for at least 6 months. The primary caregiver completed a dimensional measure, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and a categorical measure, either the Child Symptom Inventory (CSI) or the Adolescent Symptom Inventory (ASI). Correlation coefficients were computed between the CBCL scores and CSI/ASI symptom scores. For all children, diagnostic risk was higher than norms on CSI/ASI for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) inattentive type, ADHD combined type, oppositional defiant disorder, and dysthymic disorder. For children between 9 and 12 years, elevated scores were found on CBCL, total, internalizing, and attention problems, and on CSI, diagnostic risk for conduct disorder and Asperger syndrome. For children of 13 and 14 years, ASI diagnostic risk was higher for specific phobia, obsessions, posttraumatic stress disorder, motor tics, antisocial personality, panic attack, somatization disorder, and enuresis. CBCL and symptom scores on the CSI/ASI were significantly correlated. The conclusion was that children with epilepsy have high rates of behavioral difficulties on both dimensional and categorical measures. Concurrent validity for the CSI/ASI was supported.

Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	2008	V Bitsika, C F Sharpley, S Orapeleng		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes symptoms that vary in severity and frequency between children. Consequently, multiple psychometric assessment procedures are recommended to detect an ASD, including scales which asses the presence and nature of ASD-related behaviour. However, to date, few studies have examined the relative and specific contribution which such behaviourally oriented scales can make to the diagnosis of individual children with ASD.
19015969	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0663-6	Restricted and repetitive behaviours, sensory processing and cognitive style in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Yu-Han Chen, Jacqui Rodgers, Helen McConachie		Many individuals with autism tend to focus on details. It has been suggested that this cognitive style may underlie the presence of stereotyped routines, repetitive interests and behaviours, and both relate in some way to sensory abnormalities. Twenty-nine children with diagnosis of high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome completed the Embedded Figures Test (EFT), and their parents the Short Sensory Profile and Childhood Routines Inventory. Significant correlations were found between degree of sensory abnormalities and amount of restricted and repetitive behaviours reported. Repetitive behaviours, age and IQ significantly predicted completion time on the EFT. The results suggest a cognitive link between an individual's detail-focused cognitive style and their repetitiveness. No such relationship was found with sensory processing abnormalities, which may arise at a more peripheral level of functioning.
19015104	doi: 10.1093/scan/nsn007	Abnormal cerebral effective connectivity during explicit emotional processing in adults with autism spectrum disorder.	Social cognitive and affective neuroscience	2008	Bruno Wicker, Pierre Fonlupt, Bénédicte Hubert, Carole Tardif, Bruno Gepner, Christine Deruelle		Several recent studies suggest that autism may result from abnormal communication between brain regions. We directly assessed this hypothesis by testing the presence of abnormalities in a model of the functional cerebral network engaged during explicit emotion processing in adults with high functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. Comparison of structural equation models revealed abnormal patterns of effective connectivity, with the prefrontal cortex as a key site of dysfunction. These findings provide evidence that abnormal long-range connectivity between structures of the 'social brain' could explain the socio-emotional troubles that characterize the autistic pathology.

Clinical practice and epidemiology in mental health : CP & EMH	2008	Michele Raja, Antonella Azzoni		Asperger's Syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder that is sometimes unrecognized, especially in the adult psychiatric setting. On the other hand, in patients with an AS diagnosis, comorbid psychiatric disorders may be unrecognized in the juvenile setting. The aim of the paper is to show and discuss some troublesome and complex problems of the management of patients with AS and comorbid Bipolar Disorder (BD).
19005031	doi: 10.1177/1362361308097118	Emotion recognition in faces and the use of visual context in young people with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Barry Wright, Natalie Clarke, Jo Jordan, Andrew W Young, Paula Clarke, Jeremy Miles, Kate Nation, Leesa Clarke, Christine Williams		We compared young people with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with age, sex and IQ matched controls on emotion recognition of faces and pictorial context. Each participant completed two tests of emotion recognition. The first used Ekman series faces. The second used facial expressions in visual context. A control task involved identifying occupations using visual context. The ability to recognize emotions in faces (with or without context) and the ability to identify occupations from context was positively correlated with both increasing age and IQ score. Neither a diagnosis of ASD nor a measure of severity (Autism Quotient score) affected these abilities, except that the participants with ASD were significantly worse at recognizing angry and happy facial expressions. Unlike the control group, most participants with ASD mirrored the facial expression before interpreting it. Test conditions may lead to results different from everyday life. Alternatively, deficits in emotion recognition in high-functioning ASD may be less marked than previously thought.

Talanta	2006	Sandra Babić, Danijela Asperger, Dragana Mutavdzić, Alka J M Horvat, Marija Kastelan-Macan		This work focuses on the application of SPE-HPLC analysis of important veterinary pharmaceuticals from different classes in highly complex wastewater matrix. The pharmaceutical investigated included three sulfonamides (sulfamethazine, sulfadiazine and sulfaguanidine), a sulfonamide synergist (trimethoprim), a tetracycline (oxytetracycline), a fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacine) and a beta-lactame (penicillin G/procaine). The method involves pre-concentration and clean-up by solid phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis HLB extraction catridges. Final analysis of the selected pharmaceutical compounds was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diode array detector (DAD). Recoveries were ranged from 68.3 to 97.9% with relative standard deviation below 8.4%. Only for sulfaguanidine low recovery was obtained. Limits of quantification were in the range 1.5-100mug/L depending on pharmaceutical. The described method was applied to the determination of pharmaceuticals in wastewater samples from pharmaceutical industry.

Biological psychiatry	2009	Ilaria Minio-Paluello, Simon Baron-Cohen, Alessio Avenanti, Vincent Walsh, Salvatore M Aglioti		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental condition within the autism spectrum conditions (ASC) characterized by specific difficulties in communication, social interaction, and empathy that is essential for sharing and understanding others' feelings and emotions. Although reduced empathy is considered a core feature of ASC, neurophysiological evidence of empathic deficits before and below mentalizing and perspective taking is lacking. We explored whether people with AS differ from neurotypical control participants in their empathic corticospinal response to the observation of others' pain and the modulatory role played by phenomenal experience of observed pain and personality traits.
18810310	doi: 10.1007/s00787-008-0711-y	Everyday social and conversation applications of theory-of-mind understanding by children with autism-spectrum disorders or typical development.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2009	Candida C Peterson, Michelle Garnett, Adrian Kelly, Tony Attwood		Children with autism-spectrum disorders (ASD) often fail laboratory false-belief tests of theory of mind (ToM). Yet how this impacts on their everyday social behavior is less clear, partly owing to uncertainty over which specific everyday conversational and social skills require ToM understanding. A new caregiver-report scale of these everyday applications of ToM was developed and validated in two studies. Study 1 obtained parent ratings of 339 children (85 with autism; 230 with Asperger's; 24 typically-developing) on the new scale and results revealed (a) that the scale had good psychometric properties and (b) that children with ASD had significantly more everyday mindreading difficulties than typical developers. In Study 2, we directly tested links between laboratory ToM and everyday mindreading using teacher ratings on the new scale. The sample of 25 children included 15 with autism and 10 typical developers aged 5-12 years. Children in both groups who passed laboratory ToM tests had fewer everyday mindreading difficulties than those of the same diagnosis who failed. Yet, intriguingly, autistic ToM-passers still had more problems with everyday mindreading than younger typically-developing ToM-failers. The possible roles of family conversation and peer interaction, along with ToM, in everyday social functioning were considered.

Pediatric neurology	2008	Deborah K Sokol, Lan S Chen, Dawn R Wagenknecht, John A McIntyre		A 12-year-old African American boy with mental retardation and Asperger's disorder presented with acute psychosis. Antiphospholipid antibody testing with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed increased levels of immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid, but not in the serum. Although antiphospholipid antibodies have been reported in the serum of patients with thrombotic and neurologic disorders, there are only a few reports of these antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid. This finding is consistent with a recent report of antiphospholipid antibodies found in the cerebrospinal fluid of adults with acute psychosis.
18801879	doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddn300	Mutations in the calcium-related gene IL1RAPL1 are associated with autism.	Human molecular genetics	2008			In a systematic sequencing screen of synaptic genes on the X chromosome, we have identified an autistic female without mental retardation (MR) who carries a de novo frameshift Ile367SerfsX6 mutation in Interleukin-1 Receptor Accessory Protein-Like 1 (IL1RAPL1), a gene implicated in calcium-regulated vesicle release and dendrite differentiation. We showed that the function of the resulting truncated IL1RAPL1 protein is severely altered in hippocampal neurons, by measuring its effect on neurite outgrowth activity. We also sequenced the coding region of the close related member IL1RAPL2 and of NCS-1/FREQ, which physically interacts with IL1RAPL1, in a cohort of subjects with autism. The screening failed to identify non-synonymous variant in IL1RAPL2, whereas a rare missense (R102Q) in NCS-1/FREQ was identified in one autistic patient. Furthermore, we identified by comparative genomic hybridization a large intragenic deletion of exons 3-7 of IL1RAPL1 in three brothers with autism and/or MR. This deletion causes a frameshift and the introduction of a premature stop codon, Ala28GlufsX15, at the very beginning of the protein. All together, our results indicate that mutations in IL1RAPL1 cause a spectrum of neurological impairments ranging from MR to high functioning autism.
18783362	doi: 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2008.00050.x	Genomic imprinting in the development and evolution of psychotic spectrum conditions.	Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society	2008	Bernard Crespi	Department of Biosciences, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby BCV5A1S6, Canada. crespi@sfu.ca	I review and evaluate genetic and genomic evidence salient to the hypothesis that the development and evolution of psychotic spectrum conditions have been mediated in part by alterations of imprinted genes expressed in the brain. Evidence from the genetics and genomics of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, Prader-Willi syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, and other neurogenetic conditions support the hypothesis that the etiologies of psychotic spectrum conditions commonly involve genetic and epigenetic imbalances in the effects of imprinted genes, with a bias towards increased relative effects from imprinted genes with maternal expression or other genes favouring maternal interests. By contrast, autistic spectrum conditions, including Kanner autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, Turner syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, commonly engender increased relative effects from paternally expressed imprinted genes, or reduced effects from genes favouring maternal interests. Imprinted-gene effects on the etiologies of autistic and psychotic spectrum conditions parallel the diametric effects of imprinted genes in placental and foetal development, in that psychotic spectrum conditions tend to be associated with undergrowth and relatively-slow brain development, whereas some autistic spectrum conditions involve brain and body overgrowth, especially in foetal development and early childhood. An important role for imprinted genes in the etiologies of psychotic and autistic spectrum conditions is consistent with neurodevelopmental models of these disorders, and with predictions from the conflict theory of genomic imprinting.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Efrosini Kalyva	Department of Psychology, City Liberal Studies, Affiliated Institution of the University of Sheffield, 24 Proxenou Koromila Street, 546 22, Thessaloniki, Greece. kalyva@city.academic.gr	Despite the evidence that individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) have a propensity for being underweight or having comorbid eating disorders, no previous research has compared the eating attitudes of adolescent girls with AS to typically developing peers. This study compared reports of eating problems provided by the adolescent girls themselves (56 with and 56 without AS) and their mothers on the EAT-26. Results indicated that adolescent girls with AS are at a higher risk for eating problems than their typically developing peers according to their reports and the reports of their mothers. Moreover, it was found that although the agreement between mothers' and daughter's reports is very satisfactory, mothers of girls with AS report statistically less eating-disordered behaviors than their daughters.

Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2008	Tomonori Koyama, Naoko Inada, Hiromi Tsujii, Hiroshi Kurita		An original combination score (i.e. the sum of Vocabulary and Comprehension subtracted from the sum of Block Design and Digit Span) was created from the four Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Third Edition (WISC-III) subtests identified by discriminant analysis on WISC-III data from 139/129 children with/without pervasive developmental disorders (PDD; mean, 8.3/8.1 years) and its utility examined for predicting PDD. Its best cut-off was 2/3, with sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 0.68, 0.61, 0.65 and 0.64, respectively. The score seems useful, so long as clinicians are aware of its limitations and use it only as a supplemental measure in PDD diagnosis.
18775366	doi: 10.1016/j.chc.2008.06.009	Treatment of inattention, overactivity, and impulsiveness in autism spectrum disorders.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2008	Michael G Aman, Cristan A Farmer, Jill Hollway, L Eugene Arnold		We reviewed the recent literature on medicines used to manage inattention, impulsiveness, and overactivity in children with pervasive developmental disorders (autistic disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, Asperger's disorder) using computer searches of pharmacologic studies. A substantial number of reports were identified and summarized. The literature tends to be dominated by uncontrolled studies, although the number of controlled trials is growing. Findings are described for psychostimulants, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, alpha adrenergic agonists, antidepressants, anxiolytics, cholinesterase inhibitors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockers, and antiepileptic mood stabilizers. Evidence for a positive effect is strongest for psychostimulants, noradrenergic reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, and alpha adrenergic agonists. Evidence for efficacy seems weakest for newer antidepressants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers.

Psychological medicine	2009	B Hallahan, E M Daly, G McAlonan, E Loth, F Toal, F O'Brien, D Robertson, S Hales, C Murphy, K C Murphy, D G M Murphy		Several prior reports have found that some young children with autism spectrum disorder [ASD; including autism and Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder - not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS)] have a significant increase in head size and brain weight. However, the findings from older children and adults with ASD are inconsistent. This may reflect the relatively small sample sizes that were studied, clinical heterogeneity, or age-related brain differences.

18774263	doi: 10.1016/j.schres.2008.07.021	Theory of mind and frontal lobe pathology in schizophrenia: a voxel-based morphometry study.	Schizophrenia research	2008	Kazuyuki Hirao, Jun Miyata, Hironobu Fujiwara, Makiko Yamada, Chihiro Namiki, Mitsuaki Shimizu, Nobukatsu Sawamoto, Hidenao Fukuyama, Takuji Hayashi, Toshiya Murai		"Impaired ability to infer the mental states of others (theory of mind; ToM) is considered to be a key contributor to the poor social functioning of patients with schizophrenia. Although neuroimaging and lesion studies have provided empirical evidence for the neural basis of ToM ability, including the involvement of several prefrontal and temporal structures, the association between pathology of these structures and ToM impairment in schizophrenia patients is less well understood. To address this issue, we investigated structural brain abnormalities and ToM impairment in patients with schizophrenia, and examined the relationship between them. Twenty schizophrenia patients and 20 age-, sex- and education-matched healthy participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and were examined for ToM ability based on the revised version of the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes"" (or Eyes) test [Baron-Cohen, S., Wheelwright, S., Hill, J., Raste, Y., Plumb, I., 2001. The 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' test revised version: A study with normal adults, and adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism. J. Child Psychol. Psychiatry 42, 241-251]. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to investigate regional brain alterations. Relative to normal controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited gray matter reductions in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right superior temporal gyrus (STG) and right insula. The patients performed poorly on the Eyes test. Importantly, poor performance on the Eyes test was found to be associated with gray matter reduction in the left VLPFC in the patient group. These results suggest that prefrontal cortical reduction, especially in the left VLPFC, is a key pathology underlying the difficulties faced by schizophrenia patients in inferring the mental states of others."
18773316	doi: 10.1080/14616730802113687	Attachment in adults with high-functioning autism.	Attachment & human development	2008	Emma L Taylor, Mary Target, Tony Charman		This study assessed attachment security in adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders, using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996). Of 20 participants, three were classified as securely attached, the same proportion as would be expected in a general clinical sample. Participants' AAIs were less coherent and lower in reflective function than those of controls, who were matched for attachment status and mood disorder. A parallel interview suggested that some aspects of participants' responses were influenced by their general discourse style, while other AAI scale scores appeared to reflect their state of mind with respect to attachment more specifically. There was little evidence that attachment security was related to IQ, autistic symptomatology or theory of mind. This study suggests that adults with autism can engage with the AAI and produce scoreable narratives of their attachment experiences, and a minority demonstrate secure attachment.
18766980	doi: 10.1080/13554790802368661	Effect of propranolol on verbal problem solving in autism spectrum disorder.	Neurocase	2008	David Q Beversdorf, Allen L Carpenter, Regan F Miller, Jacquelyne S Cios, Ashleigh Hillier		The noradrenergic system modulates performance on tasks dependent on semantic and associative network flexibility (NF) in individuals without neurodevelopmental diagnoses in experiments using a beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol. Some studies suggest drugs decreasing noradrenergic activity are beneficial in ASD. In individuals without neurodevelopmental diagnoses, propranolol is beneficial only for difficult NF-dependent problems. However, in populations with altered noradrenergic regulation, propranolol also benefits performance for simple problems. Due to decreased flexibility of access to networks in ASD, we wished to examine the effect of propranolol on NF in ASD. ASD subjects benefited from propranolol on simple anagrams, whereas control subjects were impaired by propranolol. Further study will be necessary to confirm this finding in a larger sample and to compare clinical response with cognitive response to propranolol.
18763876	doi: 10.1037/0894-4105.22.5.563	Intact implicit learning of spatial context and temporal sequences in childhood autism spectrum disorder.	Neuropsychology	2008	Kelly Anne Barnes, James H Howard, Darlene V Howard, Lisa Gilotty, Lauren Kenworthy, William D Gaillard, Chandan J Vaidya		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by atypicalities in domains that are posited to rely on implicit learning processes such as social communication, language, and motor behavior. The authors examined 2 forms of implicit learning in 14 children with high-functioning ASD (10 of whom were diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome) and 14 control children, learning of spatial context known to be mediated by the medial temporal lobes (using the contextual cueing task) and of sequences known to be mediated by frontal-striatal and frontal-cerebellar circuits (using the alternating serial reaction time task). Both forms of learning were unimpaired in ASD. Spatial contextual implicit learning was spared in ASD despite slower visual search of spatial displays. The present findings provide evidence for the integrity of learning processes dependent on integration of spatial and sequential contextual information in high-functioning children with ASD.
18754916	doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8749.2008.03042.x	Prevalence and characteristics of autistic spectrum disorders in the ALSPAC cohort.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2008	Emma Williams, Kate Thomas, Helen Sidebotham, Alan Emond		The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) within a large representative population sample: the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Cases of ASD were identified from the clinical notes of children in the ALSPAC with a suspected developmental disorder and from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC) for England in 2003. Seventy-one cases of ASD diagnosed after a multidisciplinary assessment were identified from health records. There were an additional 15 cases from PLASC data in which ASD was mentioned as a principal difficulty, thus giving a total of 86 children diagnosed by the age of 11 years. Prevalence of ASD per 10,000 population at 11 years was 51.1 for those with a multi-professional diagnosis, and 61.9 if cases from education were included, made up of 21.6 for childhood autism, 10.8 for atypical autism, 16.6 for Asperger syndrome, and 13.0 for unspecified ASD. The male:female ratio was 6.8:1. Median age at diagnosis ranged from 45 months in childhood autism to 116 months in Asperger syndrome. A comorbid developmental disorder was recorded in 33.8% of cases, including learning disability in 14.7%, epilepsy in 10.3%, and mixed developmental disorder in 4.4%. We conclude that the prevalence of ASD diagnosed at 11 years in a UK representative population-based sample is at least 51.1/10,000.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Laudan B Jahromi, Connie L Kasari, James T McCracken, Lisa S-Y Lee, Michael G Aman, Christopher J McDougle, Lawrence Scahill, Elaine Tierney, L Eugene Arnold, Benedetto Vitiello, Louise Ritz, Andrea Witwer, Erin Kustan, Jaswinder Ghuman, David J Posey		This report examined the effect of methylphenidate on social communication and self-regulation in children with pervasive developmental disorders and hyperactivity in a secondary analysis of RUPP Autism Network data. Participants were 33 children (29 boys) between the ages of 5 and 13 years who participated in a four-week crossover trial of placebo and increasing doses of methylphenidate given in random order each for one week. Observational measures of certain aspects of children's social communication, self-regulation, and affective behavior were obtained each week. A significant positive effect of methylphenidate was seen on children's use of joint attention initiations, response to bids for joint attention, self-regulation, and regulated affective state. The results go beyond the recent literature and suggest that methylphenidate may have positive effects on social behaviors in children with PDD and hyperactivity.
18726150	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0634-y	Faux pas detection and intentional action in Asperger Syndrome. A replication on a French sample.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Tiziana Zalla, Anca-Maria Sav, Astrid Stopin, Sabrina Ahade, Marion Leboyer		In the present study, we investigated mind reading abilities in a group of adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) by using the faux pas task, an advanced test of theory of mind (Baron-Cohen et al. (1999). Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 29, 407-418). The faux pas is a particular case of a non-intentional action reflecting an involuntary socially inappropriate behavior. Here, individuals with AS over-detected faux pas stories, failed to provide correct justifications of the speaker's behavior and were unaware of the mistaken belief and of the resulting emotional impact, whereas they appeared to be responsive to social rule violations. We hypothesized that because of an impaired theory-of-mind, individuals with AS may develop compensatory cognitive strategies based on overlearned abstract knowledge about normative rules.

18712466	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0559-5	Brief report: atypical social cognition and social behaviours in autism spectrum disorder: a different way of processing rather than an impairment.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Kate O'Connor, Ian Kirk		"A central question to autism research is whether autism is largely the result of an impairment in social cognition and/or motivation or the result of a more general processing difference. This review discusses problems with the ""social deficit"" model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is suggested that superior attention to low-level perceptual information potentially coupled with decreased attention to global information may provide a more comprehensive explanation for atypical social behaviours in ASD. This processing style may reflect increased activation of occipital-temporal regions and reduced functional (and possibly anatomical) connectivity. It is concluded that atypical social behaviours in ASD are more likely to be a consequence reflective of a general processing difference than impairment in social cognition and/or motivation."

18701743	doi: 10.1177/0886260508322195	Risk factors for violent offending in autism spectrum disorder: a national study of hospitalized individuals.	Journal of interpersonal violence	2009	Niklas Långström, Martin Grann, Vladislav Ruchkin, Gabrielle Sjöstedt, Seena Fazel		Little is known about risk factors for violence among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study uses data from Swedish longitudinal registers for all 422 individuals hospitalized with autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome during 1988-2000 and compares those committing violent or sexual offenses with those who did not. Thirty-one individuals with ASD (7%) were convicted of violent nonsexual crimes and two of sexual offenses. Violent individuals with ASD are more often male and diagnosed with Asperger syndrome rather than autistic disorder. Furthermore, comorbid psychotic and substance use disorders are associated with violent offending. We conclude that violent offending in ASD is related to similar co-occurring psychopathology as previously found among violent individuals without ASD. Although this study does not answer whether ASDs are associated with increased risk of violent offending compared with the general population, careful risk assessment and management may be indicated for some individuals with Asperger syndrome.
18692233	doi: 10.1016/j.adolescence.2008.03.004	Friendship, loneliness and depression in adolescents with Asperger's Syndrome.	Journal of adolescence	2009	Andrew J O Whitehouse, Kevin Durkin, Emma Jaquet, Kathryn Ziatas		This study investigated the relation between friendship, loneliness and depressive symptoms in adolescents with Asperger's Syndrome (AS). Thirty-five adolescents with AS and 35 controls matched on chronological age, school year and gender distribution, completed questionnaires designed to ascertain the quality of their best-friendship, motivation for developing friendships, feelings of loneliness and depressive symptomatology. Relative to the comparison group, the participants with AS reported poorer quality of best-friendship and less motivation to develop friendships. The individuals with AS displayed higher levels of loneliness and depressive symptoms, with loneliness being negatively correlated with the quality of their best-friendship. Increased levels of loneliness in the adolescents with AS was predicted by the extent to which their best-friendships were characterized by high levels of conflict/betrayal. Increased depressive symptoms in the adolescents with AS were also predicted by this factor. The findings indicate that increased levels of negative affect may be related to the poor quality of social relationships often reported in this population.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2008	Gráinne M McAlonan, John Suckling, Naikei Wong, Vinci Cheung, Nina Lienenkaemper, Charlton Cheung, Siew E Chua		Autism exists across a wide spectrum and there is considerable debate as to whether children with Asperger's syndrome, who have normal language milestones, should be considered to comprise a subgroup distinct other from high-functioning children with autism (HFA), who have a history of delayed language development. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of autism are in disagreement. One possible reason is that the diagnosis of autism takes precedence over Asperger's syndrome and a distinction in language acquisition is rarely made. We therefore planned to examine a whole brain hypothesis that the patterns of grey matter differences in Asperger's syndrome and HFA can be distinguished.
18664213		[Autism spectrum disorders in adults].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	2008	C C Kan, J K Buitelaar, R J van der Gaag		Early infantile autism' as defined by Kanner has grown into a spectrum of autistic disorders. The recognition of Asperger's disorder and of pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), has led to increased demand for appropriate diagnostic assessment of autism in adults. The expression ofimpairments in social interaction, communication, imagination and mental flexibility changes during development into adulthood. The diagnostic procedure in adult psychiatry should comprise a collateral developmental interview. Autism spectrum disorders in adults may mimic, or be overshadowed by, other psychiatric disorders. For effective diagnosis, the application of structured interviews, such as the 'Autism diagnostic observation schedule' (ADOS), 'Autism diagnostic interview-revised' (ADI-R) or 'Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders' (DISCO) is recommended.
18664210		[Recognition of autism spectrum disorders in adults].	Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	2008	M W Hengeveld, L van Londen, R J van der Gaag		Autism spectrum disorder was diagnosed in three adults. The first patient, a married man aged 41, was referred to a psychiatrist with 'impending burn-out'. The second was a 32-year-old male student with schizophrenia and a depressive disorder who was referred to a centre for autism because a friend of his mother's knew someone with Asperger's syndrome. The third patient was a 25-year-old woman with a 'fixation on food' who was referred by her general practitioner to a psychiatrist for evaluation of longstanding use of antidepressant medication. Autism used to be thought of as a condition of childhood. Only recently has the diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders become the focus of attention in adult psychiatry. It is made all the more difficult as during development into adulthood, the expression of disorders of reciprocal social interaction, communication, imagination and repetitive stereotypical thinking and actions, change.

Over time, empirical evidence has supported the notion that those with ASC have superior visual abilities compared with control subjects. However, it remains unclear whether these abilities are specifically the result of differences in sensory thresholds (low-level processing), rather than higher-level cognitive processes.

Postgraduate medical journal	2008	A Ashoori, J Jankovic		"In this review, we intend to explore the often asked question: ""Did Mozart have Tourette's syndrome?"" Although there are numerous reports attributing Mozart's peculiar personality and behaviour to a spectrum of neurobehavioural disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection, the evidence for any of these disorders is lacking. Whether Mozart's behaviour was nothing more than a reflection of his unique personality or a more complex neurological disorder, aggravated later in life by enormous demands by his father and society, his behaviour has been the subject of many biographies. It will also remain unknown to what extent his accomplishments and failures were shaped by his childhood experiences, pressured lifestyle, and his innate genius and extraordinary talent. Lessons from his life may have important implications for other gifted individuals and savants whose special attributes may lead them to succeed or, on the other hand, suppress their emotional growth and make them more vulnerable to stress and failure."
18633852	doi: 10.1080/17470910701577020	Levels of emotional awareness and autism: an fMRI study.	Social neuroscience	2008	Giorgia Silani, Geoffrey Bird, Rachel Brindley, Tania Singer, Chris Frith, Uta Frith		Autism is associated with an inability to identify and distinguish one's own feelings. We assessed this inability using alexithymia and empathy questionnaires, and used fMRI to investigate brain activity while introspecting on emotion. Individuals with high functioning autism/Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS) were compared with matched controls. Participants rated stimuli from the International Affective Picture System twice, once according to the degree of un/pleasantness that the pictures induced, and once according to their color balance. The groups differed significantly on both alexithymia and empathy questionnaires. Alexithymia and lack of empathy were correlated, indicating a link between understanding one's own and others' emotions. For both groups a strong relationship between questionnaire scores and brain activity was found in the anterior insula (AI), when participants were required to assess their feelings to unpleasant pictures. Regardless of self-reported degree of emotional awareness, individuals with HFA/AS differed from controls when required to introspect on their feelings by showing reduced activation in self-reflection/mentalizing regions. Thus, we conclude that difficulties in emotional awareness are related to hypoactivity in AI in both individuals with HFA/AS and controls, and that the particular difficulties in emotional awareness in individuals with HFA/AS are not related to their impairments in self-reflection/mentalizing.
18633802	doi: 10.1080/17470910601068088	Individual differences in theory of mind ability in middle childhood and links with verbal ability and autistic traits: a twin study.	Social neuroscience	2006	Angelica Ronald, Essi Viding, Francesca Happé, Robert Plomin		Identifying the causal processes involved in theory of mind (ToM) development during childhood is an important goal for social neuroscience. This study aimed to investigate, for the first time, the extent to which individual differences in ToM are influenced by genes and environment in middle childhood, and to assess how ToM is linked to autistic-like behaviors and verbal ability. Over 600 9-year-old twin pairs from a subsample of the Twins Early Development Study were assessed on an advanced test of ToM and on verbal ability. Parents, teachers, and the children themselves provided ratings of the twins' autistic traits (social impairments, communication impairments, and restricted repetitive behaviors and interests), using an abbreviated version of the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test. Autistic traits, particularly communication impairments, significantly predicted ToM performance. Verbal ability showed the strongest phenotypic association with ToM. Twin model-fitting was employed to investigate the causes of this association. Much of the variation in ToM ability and in verbal ability was explained by environmental influences, with modest heritabilities for each, but their association was almost fully explained by shared genetic effects. The possible neural basis underlying this association is discussed.
18633799	doi: 10.1080/17470910601040772	Impaired recognition of negative basic emotions in autism: a test of the amygdala theory.	Social neuroscience	2006	Chris Ashwin, Emma Chapman, Livia Colle, Simon Baron-Cohen		Autism and Asperger Syndrome are autism spectrum conditions (ASC) characterized by deficits in understanding others' minds, an aspect of which involves recognizing emotional expressions. This is thought to be related to atypical function and structure of the amygdala, and performance by people with ASC on emotion recognition tasks resembles that seen in people with acquired amygdala damage. In general, emotion recognition findings in ASC have been inconsistent, which may reflect low numbers of participants, low numbers of stimuli and trials, heterogeneity of symptom severity within ASC groups, and ceiling effects on some tasks. The present study tested 39 male adults with ASC and 39 typical male controls on a task of basic emotion recognition from photographs, in two separate experiments. On a control face discrimination task the group with ASC were not impaired. People with ASC were less accurate on the emotion recognition task compared to controls, but only for the negative basic emotions. This is discussed in the light of similar findings from people with damage to the amygdala.

Social neuroscience	2006	Ofer Golan, Simon Baron-Cohen, Jacqueline J Hill, Yael Golan		Individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties recognizing mental states in others. Most research has focused on recognition of basic emotions from faces and voices separately. This study reports the results of a new task, assessing recognition of complex emotions and mental states from social scenes taken from feature films. The film format arguably is more challenging and ecologically closer to real social situations.
18628683	doi: 10.1097/YPG.0b013e3282fb7fe6	Analysis of the neuroligin 4Y gene in patients with autism.	Psychiatric genetics	2008	Jin Yan, Jinong Feng, Richard Schroer, Wenyan Li, Cindy Skinner, Charles E Schwartz, Edwin H Cook, Steve S Sommer		Frameshift and missense mutations in the X-linked neuroligin 4 (NLGN4, MIM# 300427) and neuroligin 3 (NLGN3, MIM# 300336) genes have been identified in patients with autism, Asperger syndrome and mental retardation. We hypothesize that sequence variants in NLGN4Y are associated with autism or mental retardation. The coding sequences and splice junctions of the NLGN4Y gene were analyzed in 335 male samples (290 with autism and 45 with mental retardation). A total of 1.1 Mb of genomic DNA was sequenced. One missense variant, p.I679V, was identified in a patient with autism, as well as his father with learning disabilities. The I679 residue is highly conserved in three members of the neuroligin family. The absence of p.I679V in 2986 control Y chromosomes and the high similarity of NLGN4 and NLGN4Y are consistent with the hypothesis that p.I679V contributes to the etiology of autism. The presence of only one structural variant in our population of 335 males with autism/mental retardation, the unavailability of significant family cosegregation and an absence of functional assays are, however, important limitations of this study.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Rhea Paul, Stephanie Miles Orlovski, Hillary Chuba Marcinko, Fred Volkmar		Twenty-nine youth with autism spectrum disorders and 26 with typical development between 12 and 18 years of age were engaged in structured interviews (ADOS). The interviews were videotaped and rated for atypical conversational behaviors by trained raters, using the Pragmatic Rating Scale (Landa et al. Psychol Med 22:245-254, 1992). The ASD group was divided into AS and HFA/PDD-NOS subgroups. Significant differences were found among groups on approximately one-third of the PRS items. These items involved primarily the management of topics and information, reciprocity, intonation, and gaze management. The only differences to reach significance between the AS and HFA/PDD-NOS group were a greater tendency for overly formal speech on the part of the AS group, and more difficulty with gaze management on the part of the group with HFA/PDD-NOS. The implications of these findings for understanding and treating conversational deficits in ASD are discussed.

18595282		Assessing potency of high- and low-preference reinforcers with respect to response rate and response patterns.	Journal of applied behavior analysis	2008	Becky Penrod, Michele D Wallace, Edwin J Dyer		Previous research has suggested that the availability of high-preference stimuli may override the reinforcing efficacy of concurrently available low-preference stimuli under relatively low schedule requirements (e.g., fixed-ratio 1 schedule). It is unknown if similar effects would be obtained under higher schedule requirements. Thus, the current study compared high-preference and low-preference reinforcers under progressively increasing schedule requirements. Results for 3 of the 4 participants indicated that high-preference stimuli maintained responding under higher schedule requirements relative to low-preference stimuli. For 1 participant, high-preference and low-preference stimuli were demonstrated to be equally effective reinforcers under increasing schedule requirements. Implications with respect to rate of performance and response patterns are discussed.

18590948	doi: 10.1016/j.braindev.2008.04.011	Event-related potentials of self-face recognition in children with pervasive developmental disorders.	Brain & development	2009	Atsuko Gunji, Masumi Inagaki, Yuki Inoue, Yasuyuki Takeshima, Makiko Kaga		Patients with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) often have difficulty reading facial expressions and deciphering their implied meaning. We focused on semantic encoding related to face cognition to investigate event-related potentials (ERPs) to the subject's own face and familiar faces in children with and without PDD. Eight children with PDD (seven boys and one girl; aged 10.8+/-2.9 years; one left-handed) and nine age-matched typically developing children (four boys and five girls; aged 11.3+/-2.3 years; one left-handed) participated in this study. The stimuli consisted of three face images (self, familiar, and unfamiliar faces), one scrambled face image, and one object image (e.g., cup) with gray scale. We confirmed three major components: N170 and early posterior negativity (EPN) in the occipito-temporal regions (T5 and T6) and P300 in the parietal region (Pz). An enhanced N170 was observed as a face-specific response in all subjects. However, semantic encoding of each face might be unrelated to N170 because the amplitude and latency were not significantly different among the face conditions. On the other hand, an additional component after N170, EPN which was calculated in each subtracted waveform (self vs. familiar and familiar vs. unfamiliar), indicated self-awareness and familiarity with respect to face cognition in the control adults and children. Furthermore, the P300 amplitude in the control adults was significantly greater in the self-face condition than in the familiar-face condition. However, no significant differences in the EPN and P300 components were observed among the self-, familiar-, and unfamiliar-face conditions in the PDD children. The results suggest a deficit of semantic encoding of faces in children with PDD, which may be implicated in their delay in social communication.
18579646	doi: 10.1177/1362361308091652	Exploring the relationship between measures of self-esteem and psychological adjustment among adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Sara Williamson, Jaime Craig, Richard Slinger		This exploratory study examines the relationships between self-esteem and psychological adjustment among 19 adolescents with Asperger syndrome and 19 typically developing adolescents using a model developed by Harter. The groups were matched for age (mean 13 years), sex (M:F 16:3) and ethnicity (white British). Participants completed four quantitative measures examining self-competencies, social approval, anxiety, depression and self-worth. Findings revealed significant group differences: the adolescents with Asperger syndrome perceived themselves to be less competent in social and athletic domains, and to receive less peer approval. Logistic regression analyses indicated that the variables studied were particularly relevant in distinguishing group differences and worked together in predicting group membership. Indeed the variables in the final model accurately predicted group membership for all individuals in the sample. Exploratory hierarchical multiple regression analyses suggested that the two groups had different patterns of relationships between measures of self-competencies, social approval and psychological outcomes.
18579643	doi: 10.1177/1362361308091648	Referential communication in children with autism spectrum disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Svenolof Dahlgren, Annika Dahlgren Sandberg		Referential communication was studied in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) including children with autism and Asperger syndrome. The aim was to study alternative explanations for the children's communicative problems in such situations. Factors studied were theory of mind, IQ, verbal ability and memory. The main results demonstrated diminished performance in children with autism spectrum disorder, mirroring performance in everyday life, in comparison to verbal IQ and mental age matched typically developing children. Among children with autism spectrum disorders, there was a positive relationship between performance in referential communication and theory of mind. Memory capacity also proved to play a role in success in the task.
18577496	doi: 10.1016/j.optm.2007.10.015	Background and history of autism in relation to vision care.	Optometry (St. Louis, Mo.)	2008	Joseph N Trachtman	Elite Performance and Learning Center, PS, Seattle, WA 98104, USA. tracht@accommotrac.com	Although autism existed before 1943, it was Leo Kanner who is credited with the first detailed description of autistic behavior. Before Kanner's report, the behavior was generally known as childhood schizophrenia. He noted that the outstanding common feature of all the children was certain parental personalities, like obsessiveness and lack of warm-heartedness. Concurrent with Kanner's report and observations were those of Asperger in 1944. However, Asperger's report, in a German-language journal, was not brought to the forefront until the 1980s. The children described by Asperger had milder forms of behavior disorders than those described by Kanner, with the resulting diagnosis of autism broadened and blurred. The main features of the new autistic spectrum included a triad of developmental deficiencies: recognition, communication, and understanding. Regardless of whose research is read, autistic behavior is considered peculiar and difficult to treat. Early treatments included LSD, tranquilizers, and developmental remediation. A later treatment, which proved to be the most successful, is applied behavior analysis (ABA), an outgrowth of B.F. Skinner's conditioning research. The etiology of autism remains a puzzle to scientists, with the most likely hypothesis being a central nervous system dysfunction. With regard to vision, people with autism tend to have abnormal electroretinograms, deficient evoked visual potentials, and atypical opticokinetic nystagmus. Other than a higher than expected incidence of strabismus and oculomotor deficiencies, refractive and binocular vision status of people with autism have been reported to be within normal ranges. Accordingly, the most useful tests for a patient with the diagnosis of autism are those for oculomotor function, opticokinetic nystagmus, and strabismus. The optometrist, thereby, becomes a member of the team helping to diagnose and treat the visual sequelae of autism.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Gina Owens, Yael Granader, Ayla Humphrey, Simon Baron-Cohen		LEGO therapy and the Social Use of Language Programme (SULP) were evaluated as social skills interventions for 6-11 year olds with high functioning autism and Asperger Syndrome. Children were matched on CA, IQ, and autistic symptoms before being randomly assigned to LEGO or SULP. Therapy occurred for 1 h/week over 18 weeks. A no-intervention control group was also assessed. Results showed that the LEGO therapy group improved more than the other groups on autism-specific social interaction scores (Gilliam Autism Rating Scale). Maladaptive behaviour decreased significantly more in the LEGO and SULP groups compared to the control group. There was a non-significant trend for SULP and LEGO groups to improve more than the no-intervention group in communication and socialisation skills.

European child & adolescent psychiatry	2009	Marc R Woodbury-Smith, Fred R Volkmar		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder of social interaction, communication, and a restricted range of behaviors or interests. Although not generally associated with intellectual disability, the severe social disability and, in many cases, associated mental health and other medical problems, result in disability throughout life. The diagnosis is often delayed, sometimes into adulthood, which is unfortunate because there are now a range of interventions available, and the current evidence supports intervention starting as early in childhood as possible. The aim of this review is to present a description of AS, an up to date synopsis of the literature pertaining to its etiology, co-morbidity and intervention options, and a discussion of current nosological controversies.

Archives de pediatrie : organe officiel de la Societe francaise de pediatrie	2008	G Nadon, D Ehrmann Feldman, E Gisel		Current evaluations used by occupational therapists to assess and treat feeding problems derive mainly from the domain of dysphagia. The purpose of this article is to familiarize the reader with tools used, in research, for children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and to determine if any of these meet the needs of occupational therapists. The following data bases were searched: Medline, CINAHL, HAPI and PsyINFO, using the terms pervasive developmental disorder, autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, eating behavior, eating disorder, food preference, food selectivity, feeding disorders, picky eater and child. All articles published between 1980 and 2006 (n=27) were reviewed. A total of 20 studies met our selection criteria. Assessment methods are compared using the Disability Creation Model (DCP). The DCP is the Quebec alternative to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). None of the evaluation tools reviewed met all factors that may influence eating in children with PDD. Implications for research and practice in occupational therapy are discussed.

Journal of experimental child psychology	2008	Paula M Beall, Eric J Moody, Daniel N McIntosh, Susan L Hepburn, Catherine L Reed		Typical adults mimic facial expressions within 1000 ms, but adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not. These rapid facial reactions (RFRs) are associated with the development of social-emotional abilities. Such interpersonal matching may be caused by motor mirroring or emotional responses. Using facial electromyography (EMG), this study evaluated mechanisms underlying RFRs during childhood and examined possible impairment in children with ASD. Experiment 1 found RFRs to happy and angry faces (not fear faces) in 15 typically developing children from 7 to 12 years of age. RFRs of fear (not anger) in response to angry faces indicated an emotional mechanism. In 11 children (8-13 years of age) with ASD, Experiment 2 found undifferentiated RFRs to fear expressions and no consistent RFRs to happy or angry faces. However, as children with ASD aged, matching RFRs to happy faces increased significantly, suggesting the development of processes underlying matching RFRs during this period in ASD.

18555872	doi: 10.1016/j.neurol.2008.01.009	[Asperger syndrome: evolution of the concept and current clinical data].	Revue neurologique	2008	C Aussilloux, A Baghdadli		Although Asperger syndrome is described by international classifications as a category of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), its validity as a specific entity distinct from autistic disorders remains controversial. The syndrome, first described by Hans Asperger, could not be distinguished from high functioning autism (onset, symptoms, outcome...). However, international classifications propose a distinction between the two syndromes based on a delayed onset, the absence of speech delay, the presence of motor disorders and a better outcome in Asperger syndrome. This categorical differentiation is not confirmed by current studies and in the absence of biological markers, no clinical, neuropsychological or epidemiological criteria makes it possible to distinguish high functioning autism from Asperger syndrome. From a clinical perspective, it is nevertheless of interest to isolate Asperger syndrome from other autistic disorders to propose specific assessment and therapy.
18554872	doi: 10.1016/j.schres.2008.04.029	Childhood and current autistic features in adolescents with schizotypal personality disorder.	Schizophrenia research	2008	Michelle L Esterberg, Hanan D Trotman, Joy L Brasfield, Michael T Compton, Elaine F Walker		The diagnostic boundaries between autistic- and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders have varied over the years, and some overlap in diagnostic criteria persists. The present study examined childhood and current signs of autistic disorder (AD) in adolescents with schizotypal personality disorder (SPD) or other personality disorders, as well as healthy controls. A structured interview was administered to rate participants' current symptoms. Participants' guardians were interviewed with the Autism Diagnostic Inventory-Revised (ADI-R), a clinical assessment of childhood and current autistic signs. Compared to both the other personality-disordered and healthy groups, adolescents with SPD were rated as having significantly more impairment on childhood and current social functioning, and having more unusual interests and behaviors. For the entire sample, impaired childhood social functioning and unusual interests and behaviors were associated with higher negative symptom scores. Current impairments in social functioning, unusual interests and behaviors, and communication were also linked with greater negative symptoms. However, neither childhood nor current autistic features significantly predicted later conversion to an Axis I psychotic disorder over the course of three years of follow-up. The findings indicate that past and current autistic signs are more common in adolescents with SPD, but neither current nor childhood autistic features are linked with conversion to psychosis.
18551831	doi: 10.1300/J010v46n03_05	Asperger's syndrome: differences between parents' understanding and those diagnosed.	Social work in health care	2008	Juanne Clarke, Gudrun van Amerom		This paper reports on a content analysis of blogs written by people with Asperger's syndrome (AS), as well as people who are parents and caretakers of people with AS. The paper documents that the views of the two groups, based on 30 blogs from each perspective, are frequently oppositional to one another. Whereas the parents and caretakers usually accept the medical definition of the situation and seek assistance and a cure for their children, the Aspies argue against this pathologizing and medicalizing perspective. Those diagnosed with AS say they are happy with who they are and that any suffering they may have undergone has been the result of society and not inherent in their condition. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical, methodological, substantive, and practical implications of these findings.
18535894	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0596-0	Comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral interventions for young children with autism based on the UCLA young autism project model.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2009	Brian Reichow, Mark Wolery		A 3-part comprehensive synthesis of the early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for young children with autism based on the University of California at Los Angeles Young Autism Project method (Lovaas in Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 55, 3-9, 1987) is presented. The three components of the synthesis were: (a) descriptive analyses, (b) effect size analyses, and (c) a meta-analysis. The findings suggest EIBI is an effective treatment, on average, for children with autism. The conditions under which this finding applies and the limitations and cautions that must be taken when interpreting the results are discussed within the contextual findings of the moderator analyses conducted in the meta-analysis.

18516234		Do individuals with high functioning autism have the IQ profile associated with nonverbal learning disability?	Research in autism spectrum disorders	2008	Diane L Williams, Gerald Goldstein, Nicole Kojkowski, Nancy J Minshew		Previously researchers have noted a high level of occurrence of the IQ profile associated with nonverbal learning disability (NLD) in Asperger syndrome (ASP) but not in high functioning autism (HFA). We examined the IQ profile scores of a large sample of children (n = 69) and adults (n = 77) with HFA, stringently diagnosed according to ADOS, ADI-R, and DSM-IV criteria, and a corresponding sample of typical child (n = 72) and adult controls (n = 107). At least one of the three primary components of the Wechsler pattern seen in NLD were found in 17-26% of the children and 20-32% of the adults with HFA. All three components occurred in slightly more than 5% of the children and adults with autism. Overall, the VIQ > PIQ profile seen in NLD occurred in 18% of the sample of individuals stringently diagnosed with HFA. Therefore, obtaining this IQ profile is not a valid clinical discriminator between NLD and HFA.

18495494	doi: 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.03.041	Altered cerebellar feedback projections in Asperger syndrome.	NeuroImage	2008	Marco Catani, Derek K Jones, Eileen Daly, Nitzia Embiricos, Quinton Deeley, Luca Pugliese, Sarah Curran, Dene Robertson, Declan G M Murphy		It has been proposed that the biological basis of autism spectrum disorder includes cerebellar 'disconnection'. However, direct in vivo evidence in support of this is lacking. Here, the microstructural integrity of cerebellar white matter in adults with Asperger syndrome was studied using diffusion tensor magnetic resonance tractography. Fifteen adults with Asperger syndrome and 16 age-IQ-gender-matched healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging. For each subject, tract-specific measurements of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were made within the inferior, middle, superior cerebellar peduncles and short intracerebellar fibres. No group differences were observed in mean diffusivity. However, people with Asperger syndrome had significantly lower fractional anisotropy in the short intracerebellar fibres (p<0.001) and right superior cerebellar (output) peduncle (p<0.001) compared to controls; but no difference in the input tracts. Severity of social impairment, as measured by the Autistic Diagnostic Interview, was negatively correlated with diffusion anisotropy in the fibres of the left superior cerebellar peduncle. These findings suggest a vulnerability of specific cerebellar neural pathways in people with Asperger syndrome. The localised abnormalities in the main cerebellar outflow pathway may prevent the cerebral cortex from receiving those cerebellar feedback inputs necessary for a successful adaptive social behaviour.

Journal of child neurology	2008			This study assessed metabolic functioning of regional brain areas to address whether there is a neurometabolic profile reflecting the underlying neuropathology in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, and if varied profiles correlate with the clinical subtypes. Thirteen children (7-16 years) with autism spectrum disorders and 8 typically developing children were compared on (1)H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy data collected from hippocampus-amygdala and cerebellar regions. The autism spectrum disorder group had significantly lower N-acetyl-aspartate/creatine ratios bilaterally in the hippocampus-amygdala but not cerebellum, whereas myo-inositol/creatine was significantly increased in all measured regions. Choline/creatine was also significantly elevated in the left hippocampus-amygdala and cerebellar regions of children with autism spectrum disorder. Comparisons within the autism spectrum disorder group when clinically subdivided by history of speech delay revealed significant metabolic ratio differences. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can provide important information regarding abnormal brain metabolism and clinical classification in autism spectrum disorders.
18468284		A comparison of general and specific instructions to promote task engagement and completion by a young man with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of applied behavior analysis	2008	Kelly J Bouxsein, Jeffrey H Tiger, Wayne W Fisher		Previous research has suggested that the topography of instructions (general vs. specific) may influence the likelihood that young children comply with instructions. The purpose of the current study was to compare the rates of task completion of a young man diagnosed with Asperger syndrome when provided with general and specific instructions pertaining to the task. The results showed that specific instructions occasioned higher levels of task completion, even when no differential reinforcement contingencies were in place.
18454311	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0579-1	A case study of childhood disintegrative disorder using systematic analysis of family home movies.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Ruben Palomo, Meagan Thompson, Costanza Colombi, Ian Cook, Stacy Goldring, Gregory S Young, Sally Ozonoff		Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is a rare pervasive developmental disorder that involves regression after a period of at least 2 years of typical development. This case study presents data from family home movies, coded by reliable raters using an objective coding system, to examine the trajectory of development in one child with a reported regression at 48 months of age. Coding substantiated parent reports of mostly typical early development, followed by later catastrophic loss of skills across many developmental domains. Differential diagnosis of CDD and autism with regression is discussed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Gillian Baird, Tony Charman, Andrew Pickles, Susie Chandler, Tom Loucas, David Meldrum, Iris Carcani-Rathwell, Devanitha Serkana, Emily Simonoff		We report rates of regression and associated findings in a population derived group of 255 children aged 9-14 years, participating in a prevalence study of autism spectrum disorders (ASD); 53 with narrowly defined autism, 105 with broader ASD and 97 with non-ASD neurodevelopmental problems, drawn from those with special educational needs within a population of 56,946 children. Language regression was reported in 30% with narrowly defined autism, 8% with broader ASD and less than 3% with developmental problems without ASD. A smaller group of children were identified who underwent a less clear setback. Regression was associated with higher rates of autistic symptoms and a deviation in developmental trajectory. Regression was not associated with epilepsy or gastrointestinal problems.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Stewart S Newman, Mohammad Ghaziuddin		"Although several studies have suggested an association between violent crime and Asperger syndrome (AS), few have examined the underlying reasons. The aim of this review is to determine to what extent psychiatric factors contribute to offending behavior in this population. Online databases were used to identify relevant articles which were then cross-referenced with keyword searches for ""violence,"" ""crime,"" ""murder,"" ""assault,"" ""rape,"" and ""sex offenses."" Most of the 17 publications which met the inclusion criteria were single case reports. Of the 37 cases described in these publications, 11 cases (29.7%) cases had a definite psychiatric disorder and 20 cases (54%) had a probable psychiatric disorder at the time of committing the crime. These findings underscore the role of psychiatric disorders in the occurrence of violent crime in persons with Asperger syndrome and highlight the need for their early diagnosis and treatment."
18445734	doi: 10.1177/1362361307088754	Brief report: inhibition of return in young people with autism and Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Nicole J Rinehart, John L Bradshaw, Simon A Moss, Avril V Brereton, Bruce J Tonge		The aim of this study was to investigate whether the superior search abilities observed in autism/Asperger's disorder may in part be a consequence of a more pronounced inhibition of return (IOR). Contrary to our prediction, IOR in individuals with autism was comparable to the matched comparison group. However, the autism group committed more false alarm responses than the matched comparison group; this may reflect a possible inhibitory deficit, or suggest that individuals with autism rely more on probabilities to determine their behavioural responses. There was a borderline-significant trend (p=0.052) to indicate that IOR may be more pronounced in individuals with Asperger's disorder. In contrast to the autism group, the Asperger's disorder group had a pattern of false alarm responses similar to that of the comparison group. The findings further inform Minshew's complex information processing theory which seeks to establish which areas of neuropsychological functioning are preserved and deficit in autism.
18440037	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.03.008	Free recall and forgetting of emotionally arousing words in autism spectrum disorder.	Neuropsychologia	2008	Sebastian B Gaigg, Dermot M Bowler		Since the earliest descriptions of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) abnormalities in affective behaviours have been considered a prominent feature in their clinical manifestations. What remains unclear, however, is whether these altered emotional behaviours are a mere facet of abnormalities in socio-cognitive processes or whether they constitute a primary feature of the condition. A number of studies now indicate that emotional processing atypicalities in ASD extend to domains outside the broader context of social cognition leading us to suggest that the disorder may be characterised by basic abnormalities in how psychophysiological and cognitive emotional responses modulate one another [Gaigg, S. B. & Bowler, D. M. (2007). Differential fear conditioning in Asperger's syndrome: Implications for an amygdala theory of autism. Neuropsychologia, 45, 2125-2134]. In the current study, we show that although individuals with ASD, like typical individuals, exhibit a free recall advantage for emotionally arousing and semantically related neutral as compared to unrelated neutral words, they do not show reduced forgetting rates for arousing stimuli as do typical individuals. These observations provide further support for the view that psychophysiological emotional responses do not modulate cognitive processes normally in ASD and further implicate abnormalities of amygdala connectivity (in particular with the hippocampus) in the neuropathology underlying this disorder.
18437549	doi: 10.1007/s10802-008-9234-8	Autism spectrum symptomatology in children: the impact of family and peer relationships.	Journal of abnormal child psychology	2008	Adrian B Kelly, Michelle S Garnett, Tony Attwood, Candida Peterson		This study examines the potential impact of family conflict and cohesion, and peer support/bullying on children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While such impacts have been established for a range of non-ASD childhood disorders, these findings may not generalize to children with ASD because of unique problems in perspective-taking, understanding others' emotion, cognitive rigidity, and social reasoning. A structural model-building approach was used to test the extent to which family and peer variables directly or indirectly affected ASD via child anxiety/depression. The sample (N = 322) consisted of parents of children with ASD referred to two specialist clinics. The sample contained parents of children with Autistic Disorder (n = 76), Asperger Disorder (n = 188), Pervasive Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (n = 21), and children with a non-ASD or no diagnosis (n = 37). Parents completed questionnaires on-line via a secure website. The key findings were that anxiety/depression and ASD symptomatology were significantly related, and family conflict was more predictive of ASD symptomatology than positive family/peer influences. The results point to the utility of expanding interventions to include conflict management for couples, even when conflict and family distress is low. Further research is needed on the potentially different meanings of family cohesion and conflict for children with ASD relative to children without ASD.
18432510	doi: 10.1080/15368370701380843	Motor function in adults with Asperger's disorder: a comparative study.	Physiotherapy theory and practice	2008	Carina Sahlander, Monica Mattsson, Susanne Bejerot		In the original description of Asperger's disorder (AD), clumsiness was an associated feature. Several studies of children have shown deficits in motor control, whereas research regarding adults is scarce. The aim of the present study was to compare motor function in adults with AD, with a normal comparison group. Gross and fine motor skills were examined by a standardized, norm referenced test developed for children, but also used in young adults, the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOTMP). In addition, a questionnaire regarding the participants' physical activity during leisure time was administered. We found that adults (age 21-35) with AD (N = 15) performed significantly worse than the normal comparison group (N = 29) in six of eight subtests in the BOTMP. Males with AD were less physically active than males in the comparison group. Among females, physical activity did not differ between the groups. There was a positive association between physical activity and gross motor function in the AD group. Participants with AD were encouraged by the assessments. Physical coaching may be an important future field for improving quality of life in adults with AD.

European child & adolescent psychiatry	2008	Angelica Ronald, Francesca Happé, Robert Plomin		In the present study we investigated phenotypic agreement between informants (parent, teacher and child self-report) on ratings of autistic-like traits and compared the genetic and environmental aetiologies of the informants' ratings and of their covariance. Parents and teachers of >2,500 pairs from a community twin sample completed an abbreviated Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST). The twins also completed an adapted self-report version of the CAST. Structural equation model-fitting was carried out. Correlations between raters were significant but moderate (0.16-0.33). The magnitude of heritability estimates of autistic-like traits varied across raters, being highest for parent-rated autistic-like traits (82-87%) and more modest for child self-reported autistic-like traits (36-47%). Genetic overlap was significant but moderate across all raters. These findings are discussed in relation to population screening for autism and future genetic research.
18422085		[Syndrome of cerebral non-dominant hemisphere].	Medicina	2007	Newra Rotta, Josiane Ranzan, Lygia Ohlweiler, Natalia Soncini Kapzink, Sandra Steiner		In this review the meaning of cerebral hemispheric function is discussed with special emphasis in non-dominant cerebral hemisphere and particularly in the lesion of commissural, association, projection of white matter fibers. Clinical characteristics depend on etiology, localization, extension and particularly the period of brain development. The following are common findings in these patients: left hemiplegia, abnormal prosody and non verbal communication, anomalies visiospatial perception, organization, and social interaction. Similar symptoms are also present in some developmental disorders such as attention deficit hyperactive disorders and Asperger syndrome. We discuss seven cases of isquemic cerebrovascular accidents with the objective of demonstrating the more frequent and persistent findings in the acquired lesion. All patients had complete neurological and neuropsychological evaluation, and were followed up for more than two years. We conclude that motor sequel is less severe than cognitive and affective consequences.
18422083		[Pervasive developmental disorders. Clinical and genetics aspects].	Medicina	2007	Victor Ruggieri, Claudia Arberas		Pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) encompass a heterogeneous group of children with deficits of verbal and non-verbal language, social communication, and with a restricted repertoire of activities or repetitive behaviours. The frequency in general population is considered 27.5/10,000. In this study, we analyzed the clinical and genetic aspects of Autism, Asperger Syndrome, PDD Not Otherwise Specified, Rett Syndrome and Childhood Disintegrative Disorder. We analyzed clinical, behavioural and neuropsychological features. We revised different medical genetics associated conditions and divided the genetics aspects of pervasive developmental disorders into two groups: Syndromic forms (around 20%) and non syndromic forms (currently proposed to be 80%). The early recognition of pervasive developmental disorders and the diagnosis of specific associated syndromes allow early therapy, correct genetic counselling, and follow up anticipating possible complications related to the entity. Finally, although the genetic bases of autism have not yet been identified, the following candidate genes have been proposed: 15q, 2q, 17q, 7q, 12q, and X related genes, among others; which are analyzed in this study and will allow a better understanding of these disorders in the future.
18417316	doi: 10.1016/j.lpm.2008.01.020	[Schizophrenia or Asperger syndrome?].	Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)	2008	David Da Fonseca, Marine Viellard, Eric Fakra, Delphine Bastard-Rosset, Christine Deruelle, François Poinso		Patients with Asperger syndrome are often diagnosed late or are wrongly considered to have schizophrenia. Misdiagnosing Asperger syndrome creates serious problems by preventing effective therapy. Several clinical signs described in Asperger syndrome could also be considered as clinical signs of schizophrenia, including impaired social interactions, disabilities in communication, restricted interests, and delusions of persecution. A number of clinical features may facilitate the differential diagnosis: younger age at onset, family history of pervasive developmental disorder, recurring conversations on the same topic, pragmatic aspects of language use, oddities of intonation and pitch, lack of imagination, and incomprehension of social rules are more characteristic of Asperger syndrome. Accurate distinction between Asperger syndrome and schizophrenia would make it possible to offer more treatment appropriate to the patient's functioning.
18417223	doi: 10.1016/j.psychres.2005.08.028	Disturbed holistic processing in autism spectrum disorders verified by two cognitive tasks requiring perception of complex visual stimuli.	Psychiatry research	2008	Takayuki Nakahachi, Ko Yamashita, Masao Iwase, Wataru Ishigami, Chitaru Tanaka, Koji Toyonaga, Shizuyo Maeda, Hideto Hirotsune, Yosyo Tei, Koichi Yokoi, Shoji Okajima, Akira Shimizu, Masatoshi Takeda		Central coherence is a key concept in research on autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It refers to the process in which diverse information is integrated and higher meaning is constructed in context. A malfunction in this process could result in abnormal attention to partial information in preference to the whole. To verify this hypothesis, we studied the performance of two visual tasks by 10 patients with autistic disorder or Asperger's disorder and by 26 (experiment 1) or 25 (experiment 2) normal subjects. In experiment 1, the subjects memorized pictures, some pictures with a change related to the main theme (D1) and others with a change not related to the main theme (D2); then the same pictures were randomly presented to the subjects who were asked to find the change. In experiment 2, the subjects were presented pictures of a normal (N) or a Thatcherized (T) face arranged side by side inversely (I) or uprightly (U) and to judge them as the same or different. In experiment 1, ASD subjects exhibited significantly lower rates of correct responses in D1 but not in D2. In experiment 2, ASD subjects exhibited significantly longer response times in NT-U but not in TN-I. These results showed a deficit in holistic processing, which is consistent with weak central coherence in ASD.

Cognitive neuropsychology	2007	M D Rutherford, Eric D Richards, Vanessa Moldes, Allison B Sekuler		People with autism spectrum disorders appear to have some specific advantages in visual processing, including an advantage in visual search tasks. However, executive function theory predicts deficits in tasks that require divided attention, and there is evidence that people with autism have difficulty broadening their attention (Mann & Walker, 2003). We wanted to know how robust the known attentional advantage is. Would people with autism have difficulty dividing attention between central and peripheral tasks, as is required in the Useful Field of View task, or would they show an advantage due to strengths in visual search? Observers identified central letters and localized peripheral targets under both focused- and divided-attention conditions. Participants were 20 adults with high-functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome and 20 adults matched to the experimental group on education, age, and IQ. Contrary to some predictions, individuals with autism tended to show relatively smaller divided-attention costs than did matched adults. These results stand in stark contrast to the predictions of some prevalent theories of visual and cognitive processing in autism.

Harvard review of psychiatry	2008	Thomas J Leskovec, Brieana M Rowles, Robert L Findling		Autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are frequently associated with dysfunctional behaviors and are characterized by deficits in socialization, communication, and behavioral rigidity. Despite the absence of a pharmacological cure for PDDs, many of the dysfunctional, coinciding behaviors may be treated pharmacologically. This article reviews what is known about the efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological interventions for the treatment of children and adolescents suffering from autistic spectrum disorders.
18415010	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0572-8	Gender in voice perception in autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Wouter B Groen, Linda van Orsouw, Marcel Zwiers, Sophie Swinkels, Rutger Jan van der Gaag, Jan K Buitelaar		Deficits in the perception of social stimuli may contribute to the characteristic impairments in social interaction in high functioning autism (HFA). Although the cortical processing of voice is abnormal in HFA, it is unclear whether this gives rise to impairments in the perception of voice gender. About 20 children with HFA and 20 matched controls were presented with voice fragments that were parametrically morphed in gender. No differences were found in the perception of gender between the two groups of participants, but response times differed significantly. The results suggest that the perception of voice gender is not impaired in HFA, which is consistent with behavioral findings of an unimpaired voice-based identification of age and identity by individuals with autism. The differences in response times suggest that individuals with HFA use different perceptual approaches from those used by typically developing individuals.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Joanna G Williams, Carrie Allison, Fiona J Scott, Patrick F Bolton, Simon Baron-Cohen, Fiona E Matthews, Carol Brayne		The Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) (formally known as the Childhood Asperger Screening Test) identifies autism spectrum conditions by measuring social and communication skills. The present study explored the sex distribution of scores. The CAST was distributed to 11,635 children aged 4-9 years in Cambridgeshire primary schools (UK). 3,370 (29%) were returned. The median score was significantly higher in boys (median test, P < 0.001) (Boys, median = 5 (IQR: 3,8); girls, median = 4 (IQR: 2,6)). There was a predominance of boys (n = 81 (79.4%) over girls (n = 21 (20.6%)) amongst those scoring >or= 15. Exclusion of children with ASC did not significantly affect the results. We conclude that different profiles of social and communication skills in boys and girls must be taken into account when measuring these skills in the general population.

18401694	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0557-7	When prototypes are not best: judgments made by children with autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Catherine J Molesworth, Dermot M Bowler, James A Hampton		The current study used a factorial comparison experimental design to investigate conflicting findings on prototype effects shown by children with autism (Klinger and Dawson, Dev Psychopathol 13:111-124, 2001; Molesworth et al., J Child Psychol Psychiatry 46:661-672, 2005). The aim was to see whether children with high-functioning autism could demonstrate prototype effects via categorization responses and whether failure to do so was related to difficulty understanding ambiguous task demands. Two thirds of the autism group did show an effect. The remainder, a sub-group defined by performance on a control task, did not. The discussion focuses on the influence of heterogeneity within the autism group and the ability to resolve ambiguity on task performance. Finally, an alternative experimental design is recommended for further research into these issues.
18401691	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0570-x	Brief report: attention effect on a measure of social perception.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Jodene Goldenring Fine, Margaret Semrud-Clikeman, Brianne Butcher, Jennifer Walkowiak		A measure of social perception (CASP) was used to assess differences in social perception among typically developing children, children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD), and children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Significant between-group differences were found in recognition of emotions in video, with children diagnosed with ADHD or ASD performing more poorly than controls on measures of knowledge of nonverbal cues and emotional expression. The number of inattention symptoms was found to be a significant contributor to poorer video interpretation across diagnostic groups. An effect of attention on poor social perception was found that may be unique to the ASD group. Clinicians may overestimate the social deficits of children with ASD if they also have symptoms of inattention, while researchers may need to control for the effects of inattention in their studies.

Singapore medical journal	2008	Y P Ooi, C M Lam, M Sung, W T S Tan, T J Goh, D S S Fung, P Pathy, R P Ang, A Chua		Children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) often exhibit one or more comorbid disorders, including anxiety, disruptive behaviour, mental retardation, and depression. Various studies have documented the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) in treating children with anxiety. Although studies have indicated a high prevalence of anxiety in individuals with ASD, there is a lack of systematic studies substantiating the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural interventions among children with high-functioning autism.
18358502	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.02.006	Research note: exceptional absolute pitch perception for spoken words in an able adult with autism.	Neuropsychologia	2008	Pamela Heaton, Robert E Davis, Francesca G E Happé		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder, characterised by deficits in socialisation and communication, with repetitive and stereotyped behaviours [American Psychiatric Association (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual for mental disorders (4th ed.). Washington, DC: APA]. Whilst intellectual and language impairment is observed in a significant proportion of diagnosed individuals [Gillberg, C., & Coleman, M. (2000). The biology of the autistic syndromes (3rd ed.). London: Mac Keith Press; Klinger, L., Dawson, G., & Renner, P. (2002). Autistic disorder. In E. Masn, & R. Barkley (Eds.), Child pyschopathology (2nd ed., pp. 409-454). New York: Guildford Press], the disorder is also strongly associated with the presence of highly developed, idiosyncratic, or savant skills [Heaton, P., & Wallace, G. (2004) Annotation: The savant syndrome. Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 45 (5), 899-911]. We tested identification of fundamental pitch frequencies in complex tones, sine tones and words in AC, an intellectually able man with autism and absolute pitch (AP) and a group of healthy controls with self-reported AP. The analysis showed that AC's naming of speech pitch was highly superior in comparison to controls. The results suggest that explicit access to perceptual information in speech is retained to a significantly higher degree in autism.
18348375		Understanding the autistic dental patient.	General dentistry	2008	Danielle Green, Dennis Flanagan		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of many pervasive developmental disorders (PDD); others include Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder (also known as Heller's syndrome), pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and the higher functioning Asperger's syndrome. Because ASD is the most common of the developmental disabilities, it is not unusual for dentists to have ASD patients among their patient population. As the name indicates, ASD varies widely in its clinical manifestations; however, dentists are likely to encounter difficulties with communication and socialization. Although communication may be difficult, it is not impossible. A thorough understanding of this complex neurological disorder and displaying patience are vital for the dentist. This article seeks to familiarize readers with ASD characteristics and co-morbid conditions that may affect dental treatment and provide some management strategies for this unique population.
18327636	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0541-2	Examining the validity of autism spectrum disorder subtypes.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Andrea N Witwer, Luc Lecavalier		The classification of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is a topic of debate among clinicians and researchers with many questioning the validity of the distinction among subtypes. This manuscript examines the validity of three ASD subtypes (Autism, Asperger's, and PDDNOS) by reviewing 22 studies published between 1994 and 2006. We reviewed studies that examined differences between the subtypes in terms of clinical and demographic characteristics, neuropsychological profiles, comorbidity, and prognosis. Results largely did not support differences between autism and Asperger's disorder based on current diagnostic criteria. Overall, the most salient group differences were noted when samples were categorized on IQ. Drawing definitive conclusions is difficult due to the inconsistent application of diagnostic criteria and circularity in methods.
18324468	doi: 10.1007/s10803-007-0535-5	Brief report: pilot investigation of service receipt by young children with autistic spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	John D McLennan, Susan Huculak, Debbie Sheehan		Whether children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and their families are receiving recommended assessments and services is poorly known. This pilot study examined service receipt as reported by parents of young children with ASD (n = 64) from four specialty centers in Canada. While almost all children had a speech and language assessment (94%), less than half had psychological (42%), or genetic (31%) testing. Speech and language (88%) and occupational (78%) therapies were the most frequently received treatments. Overall, certain findings did not correspond to recent recommended practice guidelines. Future studies should obtain more detailed information on assessments and treatments received from larger and more representative samples to better determine the quality of care received by families with children with ASD.
18324466	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0537-y	Comparison of diagnostic methods for asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Kristiina Kopra, Lennart von Wendt, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, E Juulia Paavonen		Several different diagnostic sets of criteria exist for Asperger syndrome (AS), but there is no agreement on a gold standard. The aim of this study was to compare four diagnostic sets of criteria for AS: the ICD-10, the DSM-IV, the Gillberg & Gillberg, and the Szatmari criteria. The series consists of 36 children who had been referred to two centers with a tentative diagnosis of AS. The best agreement was between the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV criteria (Kappa coefficient 0.48), and the lowest between the Gillberg & Gillberg and Szatmari criteria (Kappa coefficient -0.21). The poor agreement between these sets of diagnostic criteria compromises the comparability of studies on AS.
18324465	doi: 10.1007/s10803-008-0539-9	Brief report: eye direction detection improves with development in autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Simon Webster, Douglas D Potter		Eye direction detection has been claimed to be intact in autism, but the development of this skill has not been investigated. Eleven children with autism and 11 typically developing children performed a demanding face-to-face eye direction detection task. Younger children with autism demonstrated a deficit in this skill, relative to younger control participants. Older children with autism were as accurate as older control participants on this task. In autism, eye direction detection is deficient in late childhood but is typically accurate by adolescence. The implications of this finding for models of social cognitive development in autism are considered.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Satu Saalasti, Tuulia Lepistö, Esko Toppila, Teija Kujala, Minna Laakso, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Eira Jansson-Verkasalo		Current diagnostic taxonomies (ICD-10, DSM-IV) emphasize normal acquisition of language in Asperger syndrome (AS). Although many linguistic sub-skills may be fairly normal in AS there are also contradictory findings. There are only few studies examining language skills of children with AS in detail. The aim of this study was to study language performance in children with AS and their age, sex and IQ matched controls. Children with AS had significantly lower scores in the subtest of Comprehension of Instructions. Results showed that although many linguistic skills may develop normally, comprehension of language may be affected in children with AS. The results suggest that receptive language processes should be studied in detail in children with AS.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Sanna Kuusikko, Rachel Pollock-Wurman, Katja Jussila, Alice S Carter, Marja-Leena Mattila, Hanna Ebeling, David L Pauls, Irma Moilanen		We examined social anxiety and internalizing symptoms using the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C), the Social Anxiety Scale for Children -Revised (SASC-R), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in a sample of fifty-four high-functioning subjects with autism or Asperger syndrome (HFA/AS) (M = 11.2 +/- 1.7 years) and 305 community subjects (M = 12.2 +/- 2.2 years). Children and adolescents completed the SPAI-C and SASC-R, and their parents completed the CBCL Internalizing scale. Adolescents with HFA/AS scored higher than the community sample on all measures. Behavioural avoidance and evaluative social anxiety increased by age within the HFA/AS group, whereas behavioural avoidance decreased by age in control participants. Data support that HFA/AS in adolescents may be associated with clinically relevant social anxiety symptoms.

Der Nervenarzt	2008	G Domes, E Kumbier, B Herpertz-Dahlmann, S C Herpertz		"Autism spectrum disorders (autism, Asperger's syndrome, high-functioning autism) are characterized by a common pattern of marked impairments in social interactions. Deficits have been described in face processing, facial emotion recognition, and social attribution (""theory of mind"") or generally speaking in social cognition. Some studies have shown that these impairments are already detectable in early childhood, leading to the assumption that the underlying cause is an early disruption of neuronal development. Accordingly, neuroimaging data have revealed alterations of structure and function in the brains of autistic children, adolescents, and adults. The present review gives a systematic overview of the existing literature on functional imaging studies using experimental paradigms of social cognition, i.e. face discrimination, facial emotion recognition, and theory of mind in autistic disorders."

Here we report a harmonized association study for DISC1 in European cohorts of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We identify regions of significant association, demonstrate allele frequency heterogeneity and provide preliminary evidence for modifying interplay between variants. Whereas no associations survived permutation analysis in the combined data set, significant corrected associations were observed for bipolar disorder at rs1538979 in the Finnish cohorts (uncorrected P=0.00020; corrected P=0.016; odds ratio=2.73+/-95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-5.27) and at rs821577 in the London cohort (uncorrected P=0.00070; corrected P=0.040; odds ratio=1.64+/-95% CI 1.23-2.19). The rs821577 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) showed evidence for increased risk within the combined European cohorts (odds ratio=1.27+/-95% CI 1.07-1.51), even though significant corrected association was not detected (uncorrected P=0.0058; corrected P=0.28). After conditioning the European data set on the two risk alleles, reanalysis revealed a third significant SNP association (uncorrected P=0.00050; corrected P=0.025). This SNP showed evidence for interplay, either increasing or decreasing risk, dependent upon the presence or absence of rs1538979 or rs821577. These findings provide further support for the role of DISC1 in psychiatric illness and demonstrate the presence of locus heterogeneity, with the effect that clinically relevant genetic variants may go undetected by standard analysis of combined cohorts.
18314147	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2008.01.005	Impaired recognition of facial emotions from low-spatial frequencies in Asperger syndrome.	Neuropsychologia	2008	Jari Kätsyri, Satu Saalasti, Kaisa Tiippana, Lennart von Wendt, Mikko Sams		The theory of 'weak central coherence' [Happe, F., & Frith, U. (2006). The weak coherence account: Detail-focused cognitive style in autism spectrum disorders. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 36(1), 5-25] implies that persons with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a perceptual bias for local but not for global stimulus features. The recognition of emotional facial expressions representing various different levels of detail has not been studied previously in ASDs. We analyzed the recognition of four basic emotional facial expressions (anger, disgust, fear and happiness) from low-spatial frequencies (overall global shapes without local features) in adults with an ASD. A group of 20 participants with Asperger syndrome (AS) was compared to a group of non-autistic age- and sex-matched controls. Emotion recognition was tested from static and dynamic facial expressions whose spatial frequency contents had been manipulated by low-pass filtering at two levels. The two groups recognized emotions similarly from non-filtered faces and from dynamic vs. static facial expressions. In contrast, the participants with AS were less accurate than controls in recognizing facial emotions from very low-spatial frequencies. The results suggest intact recognition of basic facial emotions and dynamic facial information, but impaired visual processing of global features in ASDs.
18311515	doi: 10.1007/s10803-007-0530-x	Brief report: do individuals with autism spectrum disorder think they know their own minds?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Peter Mitchell, Kelly O'Keefe		How much do individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) think they know about their inner states? To find out, we asked 24 participants with ASD and 24 non-clinical participants to rate how well they knew about six topics of self knowledge; they also rated how well a comparison individual knew these things about them. Participants with ASD differed from the non-clinical participants in assigning about the same amount of knowledge to the comparison individual as to themselves. Non-clinical participants, in contrast, assigned relatively more knowledge to themselves. The findings are consistent with the possibility that individuals with ASD do not appreciate the value of having first-person privileged access to their own inner states.
18311514	doi: 10.1007/s10803-007-0533-7	The 'Reading the Mind in Films' Task [child version]: complex emotion and mental state recognition in children with and without autism spectrum conditions.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Ofer Golan, Simon Baron-Cohen, Yael Golan		Children with autism spectrum conditions (ASC) have difficulties recognizing others' emotions. Research has mostly focused on basic emotion recognition, devoid of context. This study reports the results of a new task, assessing recognition of complex emotions and mental states in social contexts. An ASC group (n = 23) was compared to a general population control group (n = 24). Children with ASC performed lower than controls on the task. Using task scores, more than 87% of the participants were allocated to their group. This new test quantifies complex emotion and mental state recognition in life-like situations. Our findings reveal that children with ASC have residual difficulties in this aspect of empathy. The use of language-based compensatory strategies for emotion recognition is discussed.

18308767	doi: 10.1177/1362361307086663	Epidemiological findings of pervasive developmental disorders in a Venezuelan study.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Cecilia Montiel-Nava, Joaquín A Peña		The study aims to determine the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) for children receiving services in Maracaibo County, Venezuela. Children aged 3-9 with diagnosis of any ASD were recruited. We ascertained area, referral process, and definitions of ASD for each patient. A total of 430 children were identified, and 76.5 percent were boys. Prevalences were 1.7 per 1000 for all ASD, 1.1 per 1000 for autism, and 0.6 per 1000 for PDD-NOS and Asperger syndrome combined. These prevalences are lower than current reports in the literature. Differences in case-finding methods, diagnostic criteria, and lack of awareness in the general population may have influenced the number of cases identified. An ASD prevalence of 1.7 per 1000 should alert the health and education authorities to the need to reassess the services available for children with these disorders and their families.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Eve Müller, Adriana Schuler, Gregory B Yates		The study describes the perspectives of individuals with Asperger syndrome and other autism spectrum disabilities (ASDs) regarding social challenges and supports. Eighteen adults with ASDs were individually interviewed. They were asked to describe their experiences navigating their social worlds, and recommend effective social supports and strategies for improving social connectedness. Qualitative analyses of the interview transcripts revealed a number of common experiences including a profound sense of isolation, difficulty initiating social interactions, challenges relating to communication, longing for greater intimacy, desire to contribute to one's community, and effort to develop greater social/self-awareness. Commonly recommended social supports included external supports (e.g. activities based on shared interests, highly structured or scripted social activities, and small groups or dyads); communication supports (e.g. alternative modes of communication, explicit communication, and instruction in interpreting and using social cues); and self-initiated strategies for handling social anxiety (e.g. creative/improvisational outlets, physical activity, spiritual practice/organized religion, and time spent alone).
18304666	doi: 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2007.10.015	Auditory evoked fields predict language ability and impairment in children.	International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology	2008	Janis E Oram Cardy, Elissa J Flagg, Wendy Roberts, Timothy P L Roberts		Recent evidence suggests that a subgroup of children with autism show similarities to children with Specific Language Impairment (SLI) in the pattern of their linguistic impairments, but the source of this overlap is unclear. We examined the ability of auditory evoked magnetic fields to predict language and other developmental abilities in children and adolescents. Following standardized assessment of language ability, nonverbal IQ, and autism-associated behaviors, 110 trails of a tone were binaurally presented to 45 7-18 year olds who had typical development, autism (with LI), Asperger Syndrome (i.e., without LI), or SLI. Using a 151-channel MEG system, latency of left hemisphere (LH) and right hemisphere (RH) auditory M50 and M100 peaks was recorded. RH M50 latency (and to a lesser extent, RH M100 latency) predicted overall oral language ability, accounting for 36% of the variance. Nonverbal IQ and autism behavior ratings were not predicted by any of the evoked fields. Latency of the RH M50 was the best predictor of clinical LI (i.e., irrespective of autism diagnosis), and demonstrated 82% accuracy in predicting Receptive LI; a cutoff of 84.6 ms achieved 92% specificity and 70% sensitivity in classifying children with and without Receptive LI. Auditory evoked responses appear to reflect language functioning and impairment rather than non-specific brain (dys)function (e.g., IQ, behavior). RH M50 latency proved to be a relatively useful indicator of impaired language comprehension, suggesting that delayed auditory perceptual processing in the RH may be a key neural dysfunction underlying the overlap between subgroups of children with autism and SLI.

Journal of pediatric health care : official publication of National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners	2008	Sandra L Lobar, Mary Kay Fritts, Zulema Arbide, Dawn Russell		The purpose of this article is to describe the role nurse practitioners can play in the diagnosis, early intervention, and coordination of care for children with Asperger's Syndrome and their families. The article outlines strategies for how nurse practitioners in both school and primary care settings can use the Individualized Educational Plan as a mechanism where they may join an interdisciplinary team of professionals and parents. Nurse practitioners can assist parents, children, and school personnel in planning, intervening, and coordinating services for these families and their children, who are at risk for academic failure and social isolation.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Hiie Allik, Jan-Olov Larsson, Hans Smedje		The course of sleep patterns over 2-3 years was compared between 16 school-age children with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) and 16 age- and gender-matched typically developing children, using 1-week actigraphy at baseline and follow-up. At baseline (mean age 11.1 years), children with AS/HFA had longer sleep latency and lower sleep efficiency during school days, but earlier sleep start and sleep end during weekends. At follow-up (mean age 13.7 years), children with AS/HFA had longer night wakings and lower sleep efficiency during weekends than the controls. The overall change of sleep patterns, however, is similar in children with AS/HFA and typically developing controls over a 2 to 3-year period.

Journal of child and adolescent psychiatric nursing : official publication of the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nurses, Inc	2008	Andrew Cashin	The University of Technology Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. andrew.cashin@uts.edu.au	The conundrum of how to carry out psychotherapy with an adolescent whose primary currency of information exchange is visual as opposed to linguistic, and who is unable to develop a unified base of knowledge and hence generalize concepts, has confronted many mental health nurses in their encounters with individuals with Asperger's disorder. At the currently estimated escalating rate of occurrence of 1 to every 100 individuals having an autism spectrum disorder, and the estimate that 80% of these people have average or above intelligence, it makes sense that Asperger's disorder is frequently encountered by child and adolescent mental health nurses. Asperger's disorder represents a different way of being in the world that is associated with a higher frequency of anxiety disorders and depression than experienced by neurotypical counterparts. The inherent concretization in the externalization techniques in narrative therapy provide a novelly successful approach to psychotherapy with people with Asperger's disorder and in many cases resolution of the conundrum.
18262386	doi: 10.1016/j.bbi.2007.12.007	Stereotypies and hyperactivity in rhesus monkeys exposed to IgG from mothers of children with autism.	Brain, behavior, and immunity	2008	Loren A Martin, Paul Ashwood, Daniel Braunschweig, Maricel Cabanlit, Judy Van de Water, David G Amaral		Autism together with Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified form a spectrum of conditions (autism spectrum disorders or ASD) that is characterized by disturbances in social behavior, impaired communication and the presence of stereotyped behaviors or circumscribed interests. Recent estimates indicate a prevalence of ASD of 1 per 150 (Kuehn, 2007). The cause(s) of most cases of ASD are unknown but there is an emerging consensus that ASD have multiple etiologies. One proposed cause of ASD is exposure of the fetal brain to maternal autoantibodies during pregnancy [Dalton, P., Deacon, R., Blamire, A., Pike, M., McKinlay, I., Stein, J., Styles, P., Vincent, A., 2003. Maternal neuronal antibodies associated with autism and a language disorder. Ann. Neurol. 53, 533-537]. To provide evidence for this hypothesis, four rhesus monkeys were exposed prenatally to human IgG collected from mothers of multiple children diagnosed with ASD. Four control rhesus monkeys were exposed to human IgG collected from mothers of multiple typically developing children. Five additional monkeys were untreated controls. Monkeys were observed in a variety of behavioral paradigms involving unique social situations. Behaviors were scored by trained observers and overall activity was monitored with actimeters. Rhesus monkeys gestationally exposed to IgG class antibodies from mothers of children with ASD consistently demonstrated increased whole-body stereotypies across multiple testing paradigms. These monkeys were also hyperactive compared to controls. Treatment with IgG purified from mothers of typically developing children did not induce stereotypical or hyperactive behaviors. These findings support the potential for an autoimmune etiology in a subgroup of patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. This research raises the prospect of prenatal evaluation for neurodevelopmental risk factors and the potential for preventative therapeutics.
18253677		[Elements of a clinical differential diagnosis between Asperger syndrome and the schizoid/paranoid personality].	Sante mentale au Quebec	2007	Laurent Mottron, Isabelle Soulières, Edith Ménard		Individuals with Asperger syndrome may, when exposed to hostility (e.g. bullying at school or at work), develop hostile ideas against their social environment, sometimes leading to aggression. These ideas and acts may be confounded with those arising from a persecutory state in schizoid or schizotypal personality, or even schizophrenia. These entities can be confounded with Asperger syndrome due to their permanent nature, and the presence of atypical social and emotional behaviours. This paper proposes cognitive (Wechsler profile), developmental (course of hostile behaviours), discursive (qualitative features of discourse reporting hostile thoughts), which may contribute to differential diagnosis in the presence of hostile thoughts and behaviours. Consequences for case management are also reported.
18253102	doi: 10.1038/ncpneuro0731	Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders in the first 3 years of life.	Nature clinical practice. Neurology	2008	Rebecca J Landa	Kennedy Krieger Institute, 3901 Greenspring Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21211, USA. landa@kennedykrieger.org	Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a class of neurodevelopmental disorders defined by qualitative impairments in social functioning and communication, often accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior and interests. The term 'ASD' encompasses autism, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and Asperger's syndrome. ASDs show etiologic heterogeneity, and there is no definitive medical test or cure for these conditions. Around 1 in 150 children have an ASD, with males being affected three to four times more frequently than females. The age at diagnosis of ASD ranges from 3 to 6 years, but there is increasing evidence that diagnosis in the second year of life is possible in some children. Early diagnosis will lead to earlier behavior-based intervention, which is associated with improvements in core areas, such as social functioning and communication. Early detection of-and intervention to treat-ASD is crucial because it is likely to lead to an improved outcome.
18243253	doi: 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.12.004	Effects of related and unrelated context on recall and recognition by adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder.	Neuropsychologia	2008	Dermot M Bowler, Sebastian B Gaigg, John M Gardiner		Memory in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterised by greater difficulties with recall rather than recognition and with a diminished use of semantic or associative relatedness in the aid of recall. Two experiments are reported that test the effects of item-context relatedness on recall and recognition in adults with high-functioning ASD (HFA) and matched typical comparison participants. In both experiments, participants studied words presented inside a red rectangle and were told to ignore context words presented outside the rectangle. Context words were either related or unrelated to the study words. The results showed that relatedness of context enhanced recall for the typical group only. However, recognition was enhanced by relatedness in both groups of participants. On a behavioural level, these findings confirm the Task Support Hypothesis [Bowler, D. M., Gardiner, J. M., & Berthollier, N. (2004). Source memory in Asperger's syndrome. Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 34, 533-542], which states that individuals with ASD will show greater difficulty on memory tests that provide little support for retrieval. The findings extend this hypothesis by showing that it operates at the level of relatedness between studied items and incidentally encoded context. By showing difficulties in memory for associated items, the findings are also consistent with conjectures that implicate medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe dysfunction in the memory difficulties of individuals with ASD.

The goal of this study was to evaluate and compare executive functioning (EF) profiles in children with ADHD and in children with ASD with and without comorbid ADHD.

European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2008	Amy Lawson-Yuen, Juan-Sebastian Saldivar, Steve Sommer, Jonathan Picker		Neuroligin 4 (NLGN4) is a member of a cell adhesion protein family that appears to play a role in the maturation and function of neuronal synapses. Mutations in the X-linked NLGN4 gene are a potential cause of autistic spectrum disorders, and mutations have been reported in several patients with autism, Asperger syndrome, and mental retardation. We describe here a family with a wide variation in neuropsychiatric illness associated with a deletion of exons 4, 5, and 6 of NLGN4. The proband is an autistic boy with a motor tic. His brother has Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Their mother, a carrier, has a learning disorder, anxiety, and depression. This family demonstrates that NLGN4 mutations can be associated with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions and that carriers may be affected with milder symptoms.

HNO	2008	C Schwemmle, U Schwemmle, M Ptok		Autism is a behavioural syndrome, present from early life and defined by deficient social interaction, language and communication, and play. Variations in symptomatology and in prognosis among characteristic persons display a variety of other signs such as attention deficits, mental retardation and seizures that are not specific to autism and that denote dysfunction in other brain systems. Its aetiology is unknown in the vast majority of cases. There is a small minority of persons in whom autism has a known aetiology, such as fragile X chromosome abnormality, congenital rubella, tuberous sclerosis and a variety of structural abnormalities and metabolic diseases of the brain. A causal treatment is so far not possible, and there remains a regrettable lack of evaluated treatment standards. Prognosis depends on many factors, most notably the limiting factor provided by the severity of the underlying brain dysfunction and its consequences for communication, cognition and other behaviour. ENT specialists are confronted with children, adolescents and even adults in whom autistic disease has already been diagnosed in the course of investigations/treatment. If the suspicion of hearing impairment as the cause of problems in daily life is not confirmed in a patient not hitherto known to have autism ENT specialists should also consider autism in the differential diagnosis. In this report the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies currently applied for autism and its importance for ENT specialists are presented.

American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics	2008	Anne-Kathrin Wermter, Inge Kamp-Becker, Konstantin Strauch, Gerd Schulte-Körne, Helmut Remschmidt		Several lines of evidence indicate a role of mutations in the two X-linked genes neuroligin 3 (NLGN3) and neuroligin 4 (NLGN4X) in the etiology of autistic spectrum disorders. To analyze whether genetic variants in the NLGN3 and NLGN4X genes occurs in patients with autistic disorders on high functioning level, we performed a mutation screen of both genes using SSCP in 107 probands with Asperger syndrome, high-functioning autism and atypical autism. We identified four polymorphisms (rs2290488, rs7049300, rs3747333, rs3747334) and one novel synonymous variant (A558) in the NLGN4X. The polymorphisms rs7049300, rs3747333, and rs3747334 did not cause any amino acid substitutions in the total of the eight detected carriers. A family-based association study for rs2290488 in 101 trios did not reveal association of this polymorphism with autistic disorders on high functioning level. We conclude that there is no evidence for an involvement of NLGN3 and NLGN4X genetic variants with autism spectrum disorder on high functioning level in our study group.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Kenneth D Gadow, Carla J Devincent, Deborah A G Drabick		To examine the validity of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) as a clinical phenotype distinct from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), parents and teachers completed a DSM-IV-referenced rating scale and a background questionnaire for 608 children (ages 3-12 years) with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The ASD sample was separated into four groups: ODD, ADHD, ODD + ADHD, and neither (NONE). Comparison samples were non-ASD clinic (n = 326) and community (n > 800) controls. In the ASD sample, all three ODD/ADHD groups were clearly differentiated from the NONE group, and the ODD + ADHD group had the most severe co-occurring symptoms, medication use, and environmental disadvantage. There were few differences between ASD + ODD and ASD + ADHD groups. Findings for ASD and control samples were similar, supporting overlapping mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ODD.
18181794	doi: 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02048.x	Mr. Grimace or Ms. Smile: does categorization affect perceptual processing in autism?	Psychological science	2008	Andreia Santos, Cécilie Rondan, Delphine B Rosset, David Da Fonseca, Christine Deruelle		This study compared the influence of categorization on perceptual processing in adults with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and normal control participants. Participants were asked to categorize hybrid faces (composed of two overlapped faces of different spatial bandwidths) by gender and emotion. Control participants exhibited a bias for low-pass information during gender categorization and a bias for high-pass information during emotion categorization. By contrast, adults with ASD showed the same low-pass bias in both tasks. This absence of a shift in processing style in the ASD group is discussed in terms of diminished top-down modulation in autism.
18178599	doi: 10.1177/1362361307085268	Factor analysis of the Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Britt Posserud, Astri J Lundervold, Maaike C Steijnen, Sophie Verhoeven, Kjell Morten Stormark, Christopher Gillberg		The present study investigated the factor structure of parent and teacher Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) in a population of 7-9 years old children. For validation purposes, factors derived were correlated with results on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). A three-factor solution was identified on both parent and teacher ASSQ. Most of the variance was explained by one factor including measures of social function, validated by a high correlation with the SDQ peer problems scale. The second factor included measures of autism-associated problems. The items allocated to the third factor were more specific for a cognitive style typically found in high-functioning individuals with autism/Asperger syndrome. This factor did not correlate highly with any of the SDQ subscales. The results indicated that the screening efficiency of ASSQ could be increased by closer examination of the individual profile of factor scores.
18178597	doi: 10.1177/1362361307085214	Characteristics of children with autism spectrum disorders who received services through community mental health centers.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Stephanie A Bryson, Susan K Corrigan, Thomas P McDonald, Cheryl Holmes		Despite the presence of significant psychiatric comorbidity among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), little research exists on those who receive community-based mental health services. This project examined one year (2004) of data from the database maintained by 26 community mental health centers (CMHCs) in the Midwestern US state of Kansas. Children with autism were compared to children with other ASDs - Asperger's disorder, Rett's disorder, and PDD-NOS. Children with autism predictably received more special education services than children with other ASDs, while the latter were more likely to have experienced prior psychiatric hospitalization. Children with ASDs other than autism were also significantly more likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, depressive disorders, and bipolar disorder. In 2004, Kansas CMHCs served less than 15 percent of the children estimated to have an ASD. Implications of these findings are discussed.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2008	Neil Humphrey, Sarah Lewis		Facilitating the learning and participation of pupils with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism (herein referred to as AS) in mainstream schools is complex and poorly understood. We report on a small-scale qualitative study of the views and experiences of 20 such pupils drawn from four secondary schools in north-west England. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and pupil diaries. Interpretive phenomenological analysis was used to explore how pupils with AS make sense of their educational experiences. The central theme was how participants constructed their understanding of what their AS meant to them. This was often characterized by negative perceptions of their differences, such as being 'retarded' or having a 'bad brain'. The links between this understanding and reported difficulties with peers and teachers, the desire to 'fit in', and other themes are discussed. The implications of these findings for policy and practice in this area are also presented.
18172749	doi: 10.1007/s10803-007-0520-z	The relationship between form and function level receptive prosodic abilities in autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Anna Järvinen-Pasley, Susan Peppé, Gavin King-Smith, Pamela Heaton		Prosody can be conceived as having form (auditory-perceptual characteristics) and function (pragmatic/linguistic meaning). No known studies have examined the relationship between form- and function-level prosodic skills in relation to the effects of stimulus length and/or complexity upon such abilities in autism. Research in this area is both insubstantial and inconclusive. Children with autism and controls completed the receptive tasks of the Profiling Elements of Prosodic Systems in Children (PEPS-C) test, which examines both form- and function-level skills, and a sentence-level task assessing the understanding of intonation. While children with autism were unimpaired in both form and function tasks at the single-word level, they showed significantly poorer performance in the corresponding sentence-level tasks than controls. Implications for future research are discussed.
18172747	doi: 10.1007/s10803-007-0524-8	Supporting more able students on the autism spectrum: college and beyond.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Ernst Vanbergeijk, Ami Klin, Fred Volkmar		In the 1990's a surge of children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and are now approaching college age. Through early diagnosis and intervention many of these children are now able to consider post secondary education. However, these students will need specific interventions and supports in order to be successful. This article reviews the nosology of ASDs, the legal basis for providing accommodations to students on the autism spectrum, and the incidence and prevalence of ASDs. The authors provide specific recommendations regarding the academic, independent living, social, vocational and counseling needs of college students who are on the autism spectrum. With a carefully planned transition, appropriate accommodations, and support, ASD students can be successful academically and socially in college.

Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry	2008	Marinella Farré, Daniela Asperger, Lina Kantiani, Susana González, Mira Petrovic, Damià Barceló		In this work, the contributions of triclosan and its metabolite methyl triclosan to the overall acute toxicity of wastewater were studied using Vibrio fischeri. The protocol used in this paper involved various steps. First, the aquatic toxicities of triclosan and methyl triclosan were determined for standard substances, and the 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)) were determined for these compounds. Second, the toxic responses to different mixtures of triclosan, methyl triclosan, and surfactants were studied in different water matrices, i.e., Milli-Q water, groundwater and wastewater, in order to evaluate (i) the antagonistic or synergistic effects, and (ii) the influence of the water matrices. Finally, chemical analysis was used in conjunction with the toxicity results in order to assess the aquatic toxicities of triclosan and its derivative in wastewaters. In this study, the toxicities of 45 real samples corresponding to the influents and effluents from eight wastewater treatment works (WWTW) were analyzed. Thirty-one samples were from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) equipped with two pilot-scale membrane bioreactors (MBR), and the influent and the effluent samples after various treatments were characterized via different chromatographic approaches, including solid-phase extraction (SPE), liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and SPE coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The toxicity was determined by measuring the bioluminescence inhibition of Vibrio fischeri. In order to complete the study and to extrapolate the results to different WWTPs, the toxicity to V. fischeri of samples from seven more plants was analyzed, as were their triclosan and methyl triclosan concentrations. Good agreement was established between the overall toxicity values and concentrations of the biocides, indicating that triclosan is one of the major toxic organic pollutants currently found in domestic wastewaters.

19326737		Infantile autism: a chronic psychosis since infancy due to synaptic pruning of the supplementary motor area.	Nutrition and health	2008	Letten F Saugstad	Institute of Neuroscience, University of Oslo.	"The rise in Infantile Autism, learning problems, cognitive decline with age, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Diseases and the SIDS epidemic, has a common cause in the rising dietary deficit in Omega-3 brain-food. This paper suggests that aside from the wider concept of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), the rise in Infantile Autism (IA) in the last decade is the effect of deficient brain-food (Omega-3). The consequent delay of development prolongs the 2nd regressive event in infancy to pruning of the centre in the Medial Frontal Lobe System that connects Hippocampus and Cingulum. With a consequently defective Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), the Delayed Response Function is affected leading to persistent psychosis. Post-Pubertal Episodic Psychoses are associated with acute reduction of excitation, a risk of breakdown of circuitry, insufficient fill-in mechanisms, and silent spots. An acute psychosis occurs if the silent spots comprise of SMA. Only two brain areas have continuous neurogenesis, indicating their important functions: the Hippocampus and Olfactory Bulb that belongs to the Lateral Frontal Lobe System essential to survival. Concerned with necessity of action in response to the environment, it relies upon short-term memory and Acute Feedback Mechanisms influenced by emotion and motivation from the external world. In contrast, the Medial Frontal Lobe network is controlled by Feed-Forward Predictive Mechanisms related to storage of information. The Delayed Response Function is mastered at 7 months, when 2nd event occurs with pruning of axons and dendrites. An abolished or defective Delayed Response Function seriously incapacitates an individual: A defective ""Social Brain"" with an inability for conscious action and to communicate, predominates in IA. There is a near lack of speech, despite normal vision and hearing in the minority without marked adversity in pregnancy, at delivery or in infancy. I propose that the recent rise in IA despite no rise in adversity signifies a rising deficiency in brain-food. That this is so is suggested by a changing clinical picture: no Mental Retardation in an IA majority. Deficit in Olfaction is pathognomonic in schizophrenia since 30 yrs and distinguishes the Asperger Syndrome. If brain-food deficiency alone sufficiently prolongs pruning to cause absent activity in SMA in infancy, less mentally retarded IA from other causes might be observed. Deficit in brain-food was evident in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: birthweight averaged 200-300 g lower than sibs, Omega-3 levels in brainstem were lower than controls. Only 20 % SIDS died in first hypoxic episode, suggesting such episodes are more frequent than we imagined. Children with learning-behaviour problems have similarly depressed birthweight. A general deficiency in Omega-3 contributes to the lacking reduction in Schizophrenia, despite early puberty predominates. Olfactory Bulb is first affected in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Cognitive decline with age, Hippocampal dysfunctions rise markedly irrespective of disease, but the major mental illnesses and Infantile Autism in particular, benefit from ""brain-food"" that might also prevent a development of these disorders. To secure optimal brain function in the coming generations, there is a need to change the diet now from its emphasis on protein for body growth to food for the brain. This means there is a need to increase fish and sea food consumption."

18161015		Recognition of 'fortune of others' emotions in Asperger syndrome and high functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Simone G Shamay-Tsoory	Department of Psychology, University of Haifa, Haifa, 31905, Israel. sshamay@psy.haifa.ac.il	'Fortune of others' emotions, such as envy and gloating over the other's misfortune, are complex emotions experienced in situations where events are presumed to be desirable or undesirable for another person. The present paper explores the notion that individuals with AS and HFA are impaired in understanding of envy and gloating. We tested the ability of adults with AS/HFA to understand envy and gloating and compared their performance to that of age-matched healthy controls. The 'fortune of others' emotion task and an additional theory-of-mind (ToM) task were based on a task designed to assess ToM on the basis of eye gaze direction. Individuals with AS and HFA showed no difficulty on basic ToM conditions, but were impaired in their ability to identify envy and gloating. Furthermore, the ability to recognize these emotions was related to scores on a self-rating scale of perspective-taking ability and the ToM task.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Chien-Yu Pan	Department of Physical Education, National Kaohsiung Normal University, No. 116, He-Ping First Road, Kaohsiung 802, Taiwan. chpan@nknucc.nknu.edu.tw	The purpose of this study was to compare the percent time children with and without autism spectrum disorders (ASD) spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during inclusive recess settings. Forty-eight children (ASD, 23 boys and 1 girl; Non-ASD, 23 boys and 1 girl) aged 7-12 years from 14 schools had their physical activity during recess quantified using a uniaxial accelerometer over a 5-day in school period. Children with ASD were less active during overall recess, lunchtime, first and second morning recess compared to those without disabilities (p < .01). All children in this study did not achieve 40% of recess time in physical activity, suggesting that interventions for increasing physical activity of children during inclusive recess settings are warranted.
18095536		'All that glitters is not gold': misdiagnosis of psychosis in pervasive developmental disorders--a case series.	Clinical child psychology and psychiatry	2007	David R Dossetor	Department of Psychological Medicine, Children's Hospital at Westmead, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia. davidd@chw.edu.au	The early literature established the validity of the distinction between early onset schizophrenia and autism. In the modern context of increasing recognition of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and a growing interest in very early onset schizophrenia and other childhood onset psychoses, this clinical distinction is often difficult to make. This article looks at problems arising from overdiagnosing psychosis in those with PDD. Four case examples of misattributed diagnosis of psychosis are described. The features that were mistaken for psychotic phenomena are described and explained and successfully treated in the context of a diagnosis of PDD. The article describes problems of reliability of ascertaining subjective mental phenomena and the range of mental phenomena that need to be recognized in PDD. The overlap of abnormal perceptions and cognitions in both these conditions is described with reference to the literature. It is evident that more needs to be done to improve diagnostic reliability of psychosis in PDD, by improving clinical awareness and research tools.
18093031		Structural brain abnormalities in adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and patients with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2007	Sarah Brieber, Susanne Neufang, Nicole Bruning, Inge Kamp-Becker, Helmut Remschmidt, Beate Herpertz-Dahlmann, Gereon R Fink, Kerstin Konrad		Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are two distinct neurodevelopmental diseases, they share behavioural, neuropsychological and neurobiological characteristics. For the identification of endophenotypes across diagnostic categories, further investigations of phenotypic overlap between ADHD and autism at the behavioural, neurocognitive, and brain levels are needed.
18093030		Social maturity and theory of mind in typically developing children and those on the autism spectrum.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2007	Candida C Peterson, Virginia P Slaughter, Jessica Paynter		Results of several studies using the Vineland scale to explore links between social behavior and theory of mind (ToM) have produced mixed results, especially for children on the autism spectrum. The present pair of studies developed a psychometrically sound, age-referenced measure of social maturity to explore these issues further.
18081627		Emotional distress and its correlates among parents of children with pervasive developmental disorders.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2007	Atsurou Yamada, Miyoshi Suzuki, Misuzu Kato, Mie Suzuki, Sayumi Tanaka, Takuo Shindo, Kazuo Taketani, Tatsuo Akechi, Toshi A Furukawa		A number of studies have reported that parents of autistic children face higher levels of stress, but few studies examined the stress associated with the home care of children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) other than autistic disorder. The aims of the present study were therefore to (i) evaluate the emotional stress level of parents caring for their children with PDD; and (ii) explore the correlates of their emotional stress. Participants were 147 families (147 mothers and 122 fathers) of 158 children with PDD (42 with autistic disorder, 35 with Asperger's disorder and 81 with PDD not otherwise specified). K6 was used to measure the stress level of the parents. Marital relationships and personality were assessed with the Intimate Bond Measure and the NEO Five-Factor Inventory, respectively. The parents also rated the characteristics of their children with PDD through the Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS). The mean K6 score of the mothers was significantly higher than that of the women in the general population in Japan. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that the emotional stress of the mothers was correlated with the personality traits of Neuroticism and Agreeableness, perceived Control by the husband, and the children's PARS score. Clinicians can deliver better service by paying appropriate attention to the emotional distress of mothers of children with not only autistic disorder but also other PDD.
18075984		[Differences between the neuropsychological profiles of Asperger's syndrome and non-verbal learning disorder].	Revista de neurologia		B Gavilán, C Fournier-Del Castillo, J Bernabeu-Verdú		The validity of the Asperger syndrome (AS) diagnose continues to be debated due to the lack of consensus on its definition, specially regarding higher-functioning autism. Previous research has suggested that the neuropsychological profile of the non verbal learning syndrome (NVLS) might be utilized to sustain a differential diagnose of the AS with other diseases associated with development.
18064551		Autistic traits and cognitive performance in young people with mild intellectual impairment.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Jonathan M Harris, Catherine S Best, Vivien J Moffat, Michael D Spencer, Ruth C M Philip, Michael J Power, Eve C Johnstone		Cognitive performance and the relationship between theory of mind (TOM), weak central coherence and executive function were investigated in a cohort of young people with additional learning needs. Participants were categorized by social communication questionnaire score into groups of 10 individuals within the autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) range, 14 within the pervasive developmental disorder range and 18 with few autistic traits. The ASD group were significantly poorer than the other groups on a test of cognitive flexibility. In the ASD group only, there was a strong relationship between executive performance and TOM which remained after controlling for IQ. Our findings suggest that the relationship between cognitive traits may more reliably distinguish autism than the presence of individual deficits alone.
18063924		The course of diagnosis in autistic patients: the delay between recognition of the first symptoms by parents and correct diagnosis.	Neuro endocrinology letters	2007	Hana Oslejsková, Ivana Kontrová, Renata Foralová, Ladislav Dusek, Danka Némethová		The primary aim of the research was to find the delay between the first symptoms of an autistic disorder being recognized by parents and diagnosis in our centre. A secondary objective was to evaluate the number of contacts with professionals (physicians, teachers, and speech therapists) in which parents pointed out special manifestations seen in children and, in spite of that, the children were not referred to a specialist. A retrospective study assessed 204 children (59 girls, 145 boys) in total; 126 children (39 girls, 87 boys) with childhood autism (CHA), 57 (17 girls, 40 boys) with atypical autism (AA), and 21 (3 girls, 18 boys) with Asperger's syndrome (AS). The mean age at appearance of the first signs was 29.7 months (range 0-70, median 30+/-17.0) in N=201, and the average age at diagnosis was 81.5 months (range 13-276, median 69.5+/-45.2) in N=204. The mean delay in making a diagnosis was 51.3 months (range 0-246, median 39+/-40.9) in N=201. The delay in diagnosis is shortest in patients with AA (a mean period of 44.4 months = 3 years and 8 months), longer in CHA patients (49.5 months = 4 years and 2 months), and longest in patients with AS (80.8 months = 6 years and 9 months). A statistically significant difference in the period to diagnosis was found between CHA and AS patients (p=0.023) and between AA and AS patients (p=0.019). The mean number of visits to physicians and other specialists before referring to a specialized centre for diagnosis in N=133 was 2.4 (range 1-5, median 2+/-0.9). The diagnosis of autism is made late and early educational and behavioural interventions cannot be initiated.
18063034		Clinical evidence that Asperger's disorder is a mild form of autism.	Comprehensive psychiatry	2008	Riva Ariella Ritvo, Edward R Ritvo, Donald Guthrie, Max J Ritvo		The aim of this study is to obtain clinical evidence to test the hypothesis that Asperger's disorder (AD) is a mild form of autism (AU).
18058213		Performance of children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism on advanced theory of mind tasks.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Nils Kaland, Kirsten Callesen, Annette Møller-Nielsen, Erik Lykke Mortensen, Lars Smith		Although a number of advanced theory of mind tasks have been developed, there is a dearth of information on whether performances on different tasks are associated. The present study examined the performance of 21 children and adolescents with diagnoses of Asperger syndrome (AS) and 20 typically developing controls on three advanced theory of mind tasks: The Eyes Task, the Strange Stories, and the Stories from Everyday Life. The participants in the clinical group demonstrated lower performance than the controls on all the three tasks. The pattern of findings, however, indicates that these tasks may share different information-processing requirements in addition to tapping different mentalizing abilities.
18049972		Developing social interaction and understanding in individuals with autism spectrum disorder: a groupwork intervention.	Journal of intellectual & developmental disability	2007	Tommy Mackay, Fiona Knott, Aline-Wendy Dunlop		Difficulties with social interaction and understanding lie at the heart of the communication disorder that characterises the autism spectrum. This study sought to improve social communication for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by means of a groupwork intervention focusing on social and emotional perspective-taking, conversation skills, and friendship skills. It also aimed to address some of the limitations of previous interventions, including a lack of generalisation to other settings, so as to maximise inclusion in the community.
18045693		Automated video-based facial expression analysis of neuropsychiatric disorders.	Journal of neuroscience methods	2008	Peng Wang, Frederick Barrett, Elizabeth Martin, Marina Milonova, Raquel E Gur, Ruben C Gur, Christian Kohler, Ragini Verma		Deficits in emotional expression are prominent in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. Available clinical facial expression evaluations provide subjective and qualitative measurements, which are based on static 2D images that do not capture the temporal dynamics and subtleties of expression changes. Therefore, there is a need for automated, objective and quantitative measurements of facial expressions captured using videos. This paper presents a computational framework that creates probabilistic expression profiles for video data and can potentially help to automatically quantify emotional expression differences between patients with neuropsychiatric disorders and healthy controls. Our method automatically detects and tracks facial landmarks in videos, and then extracts geometric features to characterize facial expression changes. To analyze temporal facial expression changes, we employ probabilistic classifiers that analyze facial expressions in individual frames, and then propagate the probabilities throughout the video to capture the temporal characteristics of facial expressions. The applications of our method to healthy controls and case studies of patients with schizophrenia and Asperger's syndrome demonstrate the capability of the video-based expression analysis method in capturing subtleties of facial expression. Such results can pave the way for a video-based method for quantitative analysis of facial expressions in clinical research of disorders that cause affective deficits.

18038341		Frames of reference in social cognition.	Quarterly journal of experimental psychology (2006)	2008	Frédérique de Vignemont	Institut Jean-Nicod, CNRS-EHESS-ENS, Paris, France. fvignemont@isc.cnrs.fr	How is mindreading affected by social context? It is often implicitly assumed that there is one single way to understand others, whatever the situation or the identity of the person. In contrast, I emphasize the duality of functions of mindreading depending on the context (social interaction and social observation), as well as the duality of social frames of reference (egocentric and allocentric). I argue in favour of a functional distinction between knowledge-oriented mindreading and interaction-oriented mindreading. They both aim at understanding other people's behaviour. But they do so using different strategies. However, to say that mindreading has two functions does not suffice to show that there are two kinds of mindreading. One and the same ability could accomplish different functions. Unfortunately, there has been almost no experimental data on a possible dissociation between two kinds of mindreading abilities. Nonetheless, I discuss a few results that point towards a dual ability.
18034295		Brief report: an autistic spectrum subtype revealed through familial psychopathology coupled with cognition in ASD.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Renée Lajiness-O'Neill, Philip Menard		This study identified a possible autistic spectrum subtype expressed through family psychopathology coupled with autistic probands' cognitive functioning (i.e., an endophenotypic profile). Participants included 24 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 49 children with Learning Disorder (LD). There were significantly higher rates of Mood and Anxiety Disorder in first degree maternal relatives and of LD and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in first degree paternal relatives of ASD probands. Significantly higher visuospatial functioning was noted in all ASD probands for which there were higher rates of Mood Disorder on the maternal side suggesting a possible marker for an ASD subtype and indicating that maternal psychopathology may have a neuroprotective effect on visuospatial functioning.
18034294		Comparison of form and motion coherence processing in autistic spectrum disorders and dyslexia.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Stella Tsermentseli, Justin M O'Brien, Janine V Spencer		A large body of research has reported visual perception deficits in both people with dyslexia and autistic spectrum disorders. In this study, we compared form and motion coherence detection between a group of adults with high-functioning autism, a group with Asperger's disorder, a group with dyslexia, and a matched control group. It was found that motion detection was intact in dyslexia and Asperger. Individuals with high-functioning autism showed a general impaired ability to detect coherent form and motion. Participants with Asperger's syndrome showed lower form coherence thresholds than the dyslexic and normally developing adults. The results are discussed with respect to the involvement of the dorsal and ventral pathways in developmental disorders.
18033148		[Theory of mind in Asperger syndrome].	L'Encephale	2007	H Duverger, D Da Fonseca, D Bailly, C Deruelle		Theory of mind deficit can be used to explain social and communication impairments that define the autism spectrum disorder. Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states to self and others in order to understand and predict behavior. It involves the distinction between the real world and mental representations of the world. Several studies established that high functioning autistic individuals and individuals with Asperger syndrome (ASP) tend to be as proficient as controls in understanding first order false belief tasks. In contrast, they still lag behind their typical peers in understanding second order false belief tasks or more advanced tasks of theory of mind (e.g., Baron-Cohen, 1993). Most of these studies focus on the adult population and it seems particularly interesting to investigate whether children with ASP would present the same pattern of strengths and deficits as adults. In our research, children with ASP were tested in an advanced task of theory of mind based on a visual presentation of comic strips and in a more traditional assessment of false belief understanding: the Smarties test.
18032147		Cognitive Orientation for daily Occupational Performance approach for children with Asperger's Syndrome:a case report.	Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics	2007	Sylvia Rodger, Elizabeth Springfield, Helene J Polatajko		Cognitive Orientation for daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP) is a client-centred, cognitive approach to acquisition of occupational skills. Children are taught a global problem solving framework and are guided to discover Domain Specific Strategies to enable mastery of their child chosen skills. A major focus of CO-OP is on the generalization and transfer of learned strategies and skills to everyday life. Two case studies are reported that provide preliminary evidence of the effects of CO-OP on the everyday lives of two siblings (aged 9 years and 11 years) with Asperger's Syndrome. The data were drawn from the detailed diary kept by the children's mother from the start of intervention and for two months after intervention ceased. Thematic analysis of the diary entries revealed multiple detailed accounts of the children's spontaneous use of the global problem solving framework to assist with acquisition of new motor skills, to overcome organizational and social-emotional difficulties, as well as numerous examples of generalization and transfer of skills. This case report provides preliminary support for CO-OP as an intervention for children with Asperger's Syndrome that supports both skill acquisition and generalization and transfer of skills and strategies.
18026829		Brief Report: measuring the effectiveness of teaching social thinking to children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and High Functioning Autism (HFA).	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Pamela J Crooke, Ryan E Hendrix, Janine Y Rachman		"This is the first report from a large multiple baseline single-subject design study of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). This brief report examines effectiveness of teaching a social cognitive (Social Thinking) approach to six males with Asperger syndrome (AS) or High Functioning Autism (HFA). Data included are restricted to pre- post-treatment comparisons of verbal and non-verbal social behaviors. Structured treatment and semi-structured generalization sessions occurred over eight weeks. Results indicated significant changes from pre- to post- measures on both verbal/nonverbal ""expected"" and ""unexpected"" behaviors, significant increases in the subcategories of ""expected verbal"", ""listening/thinking with eyes"", and ""initiations"", and robust decreases in the subcategories of ""unexpected-verbal"" and ""unexpected-nonverbal"". Importance of social cognitive approaches for children AS and HFA is discussed."
18021459		The importance of physician knowledge of autism spectrum disorder: results of a parent survey.	BMC pediatrics	2007	Rachel A Rhoades, Angela Scarpa, Brenda Salley		Early diagnosis and referral to treatment prior to age 3-5 years improves the prognosis of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, ASD is often not diagnosed until age 3-4 years, and medical providers may lack training to offer caregivers evidence-based treatment recommendations. This study tested hypotheses that 1) children with ASD would be diagnosed between ages 3-4 years (replicating prior work), 2) caregivers would receive little information beyond the diagnosis from their medical providers, and 3) caregivers would turn to other sources, outside of their local health care professionals, to learn more about ASD.

17990090		Emotional modulation of perception in Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Ben Corden, Rebecca Chilvers, David Skuse		Using an attentional blink paradigm, we show that the typical enhancement of perception for emotionally arousing events is significantly reduced in Asperger's syndrome (AS) at short inter-target intervals. Control experiments demonstrate that this finding cannot be attributed to differences in the perceived arousal of the stimuli, or to a global impairment affecting any type of modulation of perceptual encoding. Because a functioning amygdala is critical for emotional modulation of the attentional blink, the findings support a role for the amygdala in the pathophysiology of AS. More specifically, they suggest there is a fundamental failure of the amygdala to modulate processing in cortex, a concept at the heart of some recent theories of amygdala involvement in the aetiology of autistic-spectrum disorders.
17990089		Dissociation of cognitive and emotional empathy in adults with Asperger syndrome using the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET).	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Isabel Dziobek, Kimberley Rogers, Stefan Fleck, Markus Bahnemann, Hauke R Heekeren, Oliver T Wolf, Antonio Convit		Empathy is a multidimensional construct consisting of cognitive (inferring mental states) and emotional (empathic concern) components. Despite a paucity of research, individuals on the autism spectrum are generally believed to lack empathy. In the current study we used a new, photo-based measure, the Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET), to assess empathy multidimensionally in a group of 17 individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 18 well-matched controls. Results suggested that while individuals with AS are impaired in cognitive empathy, they do not differ from controls in emotional empathy. Level of general emotional arousability and socially desirable answer tendencies did not differ between groups. Internal consistency of the MET's scales ranged from .71 to .92, and convergent and divergent validity were highly satisfactory.

17980944		Superior fluid intelligence in children with Asperger's disorder.	Brain and cognition	2008	Mika Hayashi, Motoichiro Kato, Kazue Igarashi, Haruo Kashima		Asperger's disorder is one of autistic spectrum disorders; sharing clinical features with autism, but without developmental delay in language acquisition. There have been some studies of intellectual functioning in autism so far, but very few in Asperger's disorder. In the present study, we investigated abstract reasoning ability, whose form of intelligence has been labeled fluid intelligence in the theory of Cattell [Cattell, R. B. (1963). Theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence: A critical experiment. Journal of Educational Psychology, 54, 1-22.], in children with Asperger's disorder. A test of fluid intelligence, the Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices Test, was administered to 17 children with Asperger's disorder and 17 age-, gender-, and FIQ-matched normal children. The results showed that children with Asperger's disorder outperformed on the test of fluid reasoning than typically developing children. We suggest that individuals with Asperger's disorder have higher fluid reasoning ability than normal individuals, highlighting superior fluid intelligence.
17979200		Siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorders across the life course.	Mental retardation and developmental disabilities research reviews	2007	Gael I Orsmond, Marsha Mailick Seltzer		In this article, we review the literature on siblings of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) from a lifespan developmental perspective, from infancy through adulthood, focusing on the sibling relationship and sibling well-being. We situate this review within the larger body of research on siblings of individuals with developmental disabilities (DD) across the lifespan. We then consider the genetic aspects of ASDs and their implications for siblings. We conclude that there is an evidence of atypical social and communication development in some siblings of children with an ASD during infancy. During childhood and adolescence, siblings describe both positive and negative aspects of their sibling relationship and there is some evidence that siblings of children with an ASD may be at heightened risk for social and behavioral adjustment problems. The limited research on adulthood suggests that lack of closeness in the sibling relationship and social and emotional difficulties may continue. We encourage more attention focused on developmental issues, specifically with respect to samples in narrower age groups and in longitudinal research. Finally, we note the variability in sibling outcomes, and suggest further examination of potential moderating and mediating factors, including genetic predispositions.
17975720		Psychiatric hospitalization among children with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	David S Mandell	Center for Mental Health Policy and Services Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, 3535 Market Street, 3rd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. mandelld@mail.med.upenn.edu	This study examined predictors of psychiatric hospitalization among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Data were collected from 760 caregivers of children with ASD. Cox regression was used to determine factors associated with hospitalization. Almost 11% were hospitalized. Youth in single parent homes were more likely to be hospitalized (OR = 2.54), as were youth diagnosed at a later age (OR = 1.10). Engaging in self-injurious behavior (OR = 2.14), aggressive behavior (OR = 4.83), and being diagnosed with depression (OR = 2.48) or obsessive compulsive disorder (OR = 2.35) increased the odds of hospitalization. Risk for hospitalization increased with age and over time. The results suggest early diagnosis and community-based interventions for aggressive and self-injurious behaviors may reduce hospitalizations.

Her formal psychiatric diagnosis, however, has not been clear. Some have suggested that she was simply ""different"". This paper proposes that there is a name for her difference: high-functioning autism. The features of this condition apparent on analysis of her autobiographies are examined. Janet Frame was an interesting example of what may be achieved by those with strong autistic features. It is to be hoped that current and future generations of New Zealanders with autism spectrum disorders are recognised early and given appropriate advice."

Journal of applied behavior analysis	2007	Jeffrey H Tiger, Kelly J Bouxsein, Wayne W Fisher		Fjellstedt and Sulzer-Azaroff (1973) used differential reinforcement of short latencies to decrease a child's latency to comply with instructions. We replicated this contingency with a young man diagnosed with Asperger syndrome across two tasks (question answering and math problem solving). We added a differential reinforcement contingency to teach the participant to discriminate between math problems that could be answered rapidly and those that required more time for accurate performance.
17969542		[Usefulness of the Child Behavior Checklist in the assessment of preschool children with developmental problems].	Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie	2007	Anna Hutzelmeyer-Nickels, Michele Noterdaeme		"The diagnostic evaluation of developmental problems and behavior problems in early childhood is difficult and time consuming. This study analyses the usefulness of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) as a screening instrument in a special clinic for children with pervasive and specific developmental disorders. 106 children under the age of 6 years were enrolled in the study. All children were individually assessed. Psychiatric diagnoses were based on parent interview, observation of the child, speech and language assessment as well as cognitive assessment and extensive neurological examination. In addition, behavior and emotional problems were recorded with the CBCL. The results show that less than half of the children with a psychiatric diagnosis had a total score (CBCL) above the cut-off value. However, all children with a total score in the clinical range had a psychiatric diagnosis. The syndrome scales and diagnostic scales are not sensitive. The diagnostic scale ""pervasive developmental disorder"" is not specific enough to be used as a reliable instrument. In order to improve the usefulness of the checklist, a adjustment of the cut-off values should be considered."

17965991		Thought disorder in Asperger syndrome and schizophrenia: issues in the differential diagnosis. A series of case reports.	The world journal of biological psychiatry : the official journal of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry	2009	Michele Raja, Antonella Azzoni		The relationship between Asperger syndrome (AS) and schizophrenia is still unclear. An unanswered question is, do hallucinations or delusions per se justify a diagnosis of schizophrenia when these symptoms appear in subjects with AS? The aims of the present study were: (1) to review the characteristics of thought disorder in AS and schizophrenia; (2) to describe the clinical features of six adult patients with AS who presented psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms; (3) to observe their clinical course and response to therapy in order to speculate possible relations between AS and schizophrenia. In the presence of its specific symptoms, it seems inappropriate to omit the diagnosis of AS because the DSM-IV-TR criteria for schizophrenia are also met, whether delusions and hallucinations appear early or late in the course of the disease. Recognizing and emphasizing the diagnosis of AS is not only important for clinicians to tailor the therapeutic strategy to the features of patients, but also for the patients and their relatives.
17965928		Brief report: cognitive flexibility and focused attention in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism as measured on the computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Nils Kaland, Lars Smith, Erik Lykke Mortensen		The aim of the present study was to assess mental flexibility and set maintenance of a group of individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) (N = 13; mean age 16,4), as compared with a matched group of typically developing children and adolescents (N = 13; mean age 15,6) on the computerized version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The participants in the AS/HFA group performed less well than the controls on all categories of the WCST, but the differences did not reach conventional statistical significance on most categories of the WCST. On the category failure to maintain set, however, the AS/HFA participants performed significantly less well than the controls, suggesting a deficit of focused attention.
17963433		Transition and change in adolescents and young adults with autism: longitudinal effects on maternal well-being.	American journal of mental retardation : AJMR	2007	Julie Lounds, Marsha Mailick Seltzer, Jan S Greenberg, Paul T Shattuck		We investigated how change in the characteristics of 140 adolescents and young adults with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) would predict subsequent change in maternal well-being and in the quality of the mother-child relationship. Overall patterns of improvement in maternal well-being and mother-child relationship quality were observed during the study. When the son or daughter had declining behavior problems, were prescribed more psychotropic medications, and exited from high school during the study period, mothers' well-being and perception of relationship quality improved to a greater extent. In addition, improvements in maternal well-being and relationship quality were observed in mothers of daughters, in mothers of individuals with mental retardation as well as ASD, and in mothers of those in better health.
17959814		Cortical folding abnormalities in autism revealed by surface-based morphometry.	The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience	2007	Christine Wu Nordahl, Donna Dierker, Iman Mostafavi, Cynthia M Schumann, Susan M Rivera, David G Amaral, David C Van Essen		We tested for cortical shape abnormalities using surface-based morphometry across a range of autism spectrum disorders (7.5-18 years of age). We generated sulcal depth maps from structural magnetic resonance imaging data and compared typically developing controls to three autism spectrum disorder subgroups: low-functioning autism, high-functioning autism, and Asperger's syndrome. The low-functioning autism group had a prominent shape abnormality centered on the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus that was associated with a sulcal depth difference in the anterior insula and frontal operculum. The high-functioning autism group had bilateral shape abnormalities similar to the low-functioning group, but smaller in size and centered more posteriorly, in and near the parietal operculum and ventral postcentral gyrus. Individuals with Asperger's syndrome had bilateral abnormalities in the intraparietal sulcus that correlated with age, intelligence quotient, and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised social and repetitive behavior scores. Because of evidence suggesting age-related differences in the developmental time course of neural alterations in autism, separate analyses on children (7.5-12.5 years of age) and adolescents (12.75-18 years of age) were also carried out. All of the cortical shape abnormalities identified across all ages were more pronounced in the children. These findings are consistent with evidence of an altered trajectory of early brain development in autism, and they identify several regions that may have abnormal patterns of connectivity in individuals with autism.
17952582		Coherent versus component motion perception in autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Myriam W G Vandenbroucke, H Steven Scholte, Herman van Engeland, Victor A F Lamme, Chantal Kemner		Research on visual perception in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tries to reveal the underlying mechanisms of aberrant local and global processing. Global motion perception is one way to study this aspect of ASD. We used plaid motion stimuli, which can be perceived as a coherently moving pattern, requiring feature integration, or as two transparent gratings sliding over each other. If global motion detection is impaired in ASD, this would lead to a decrease of the total time that a coherent pattern is perceived. However, in contrast to other studies in the literature, our results gave no evidence of impaired global motion perception in people with ASD. A reconciliation of the different outcomes is proposed based on spatial frequency processing in ASD.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Manuel F Casanova, Andrew E Switala, Juan Trippe, Michael Fitzgerald		It has been suggested that the cell minicolumn is the smallest module capable of information processing within the brain. In this case series, photomicrographs of six regions of interests (Brodmann areas 4, 9, 17, 21, 22, and 40) were analyzed by computerized image analysis for minicolumnar morphometry in the brains of three distinguished scientists and six normative controls. Overall, there were significant differences (p < 0.001) between the comparison groups in both minicolumnar width (CW) and mean cell spacing (MCS). Although our scientists did not exhibit deficits in communication or interpersonal skills, the resultant minicolumnar phenotype bears similarity to that described for both autism and Asperger's syndrome. Computer modeling has shown that smaller columns account for discrimination among signals during information processing. A minicolumnar phenotype that provides for discrimination and/or focused attention may help explain the savant abilities observed in some autistic people and the intellectually gifted.
17947290		Mathematical ability of students with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism: a review of literature.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Hsu-Min Chiang, Yueh-Hsien Lin		This article reviews studies investigating cognitive ability and academic achievement of students with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA). Particular emphasis is placed on the mathematical ability of people with AS/HFA. A preliminary analysis of empirical data is presented. Findings indicate that: (1) the majority of individuals with AS/HFA have average mathematical ability; (2) the majority of individuals with AS/HFA have a significant but clinically modest math weakness; (3) some individuals with AS/HFA have mathematical giftedness.
17947288		Temporal context memory in high-functioning autism.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Agnès Gras-Vincendon, Laurent Mottron, Pierre Salamé, Claude Bursztejn, Jean-Marie Danion		Episodic memory, i.e. memory for specific episodes situated in space and time, seems impaired in individuals with autism. According to weak central coherence theory, individuals with autism have general difficulty connecting contextual and item information which then impairs their capacity to memorize information in context. This study investigated temporal context memory for visual information in individuals with autism. Eighteen adolescents and adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger syndrome (AS) and age- and IQ-matched typically developing participants were tested using a recency judgement task. The performance of the autistic group did not differ from that of the control group, nor did the performance between the AS and HFA groups. We conclude that autism in high-functioning individuals does not impair temporal context memory as assessed on this task. We suggest that individuals with autism are as efficient on this task as typically developing subjects because contextual memory performance here involves more automatic than organizational processing.
17947285		Diagnostic trends in autistic spectrum disorders in the South Wales valleys.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	A H A Latif, W R Williams		This study provides an analysis of the diagnostic trends in autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) for children aged under 17 years in the Rhondda and Taff Ely districts of South Wales. In the period 1988-2004, 336 children received a diagnosis of ASD and represent the case registry data of one community paediatric team. For the period 1994-2003, the caseload of 267 comprised Asperger (58%), Kanner (20%) and ;other forms' of autism (22%). In comparison to the previous 5 year period, diagnosis of ASD in 1999-2003 increased for Asperger (2.9 fold) and ;other forms' (4.4) but decreased for Kanner autism (0.69). Male:female gender ratios and age at diagnosis fell for all subcategories of ASD. Prevalences per 10,000 children born in Rhondda Taff Ely are ASD 61.2, Asperger 35.4, Kanner autism 12.7, and 'other forms' 13.0. Detected prevalences and trends for ASD are in line with national standards and do not show an increase for Kanner autism.
17942458		The economic consequences of autistic spectrum disorder among children in a Swedish municipality.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Krister Järbrink	Centre for the Economics of Mental Health, CEMH, Health Service Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Denmark Hill, London, UK. k.jarbrink@iop.kcl.ac.uk	In this study, the societal economic consequences of autistic spectrum disorder were investigated using a sample of parents of children identified with the disorder and living in a Swedish municipality. Cost information was collected using a postal questionnaire that was developed through experiences gained from an earlier study. Using conservative assumptions, the additional societal cost due to the disorder was estimated to be approximately 50,000 annually per child. Parents of children with the disorder spent an average of about 1000 hours per year additionally caring for and supporting their child. The study indicates that the major cost drivers for autistic spectrum disorder among children can be found within the community for support and schooling, while the major impact on relatives is on time spent and thereby quality of life rather than a financial burden.
17942454		Evaluation of the relationship development intervention program.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Steven E Gutstein, Audrey F Burgess, Ken Montfort		This study is the second in a series evaluating the effectiveness of Relationship Development Intervention (RDI) to address unique deficits inherent in autism spectrum disorders. RDI is a parent-based, cognitive-developmental approach, in which primary caregivers are trained to provide daily opportunities for successful functioning in increasingly challenging dynamic systems. This study reviewed the progress of 16 children who participated in RDI between 2000 and 2005. Changes in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R), flexibility, and school placement were compared prior to treatment and at a minimum 30 month follow-up period. While all children met ADOS/ADI-R criteria for autism prior to treatment, no child met criteria at follow-up. Similar positive results were found in relation to flexibility and educational placement. Generalizability of current findings is limited by the lack of a control or comparison group, constraints on age and IQ of treated children, parent self-selection, and parent education conducted through a single clinic setting.
17940168		Mozart's movements and behaviour: a case of Tourette's syndrome?	Journal of neurology, neurosurgery, and psychiatry	2007	Aidin Ashoori, Joseph Jankovic		"In this review, we intend to explore the often asked question: ""Did Mozart have Tourette's syndrome?"" Although there are numerous reports attributing Mozart's peculiar personality and behaviour to a spectrum of neurobehavioural disorders such as Tourette's syndrome, autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection, the evidence for any of these disorders is lacking. Whether Mozart's behaviour was nothing more than a reflection of his unique personality or a more complex neurological disorder, aggravated later in life by enormous demands by his father and society, his behaviour has been the subject of many biographies. It will also remain unknown to what extent his accomplishments and failures were shaped by his childhood experiences, pressured lifestyle, and his innate genius and extraordinary talent. Lessons from his life may have important implications for other gifted individuals and savants whose special attributes may lead them to succeed or, on the other hand, suppress their emotional growth and make them more vulnerable to stress and failure."

Journal of paediatrics and child health	2008			To describe the use of diagnostic labels by clinicians for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and calculate the label-specific and overall agreement between diagnostic labels and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnoses provided by the same clinician.
17924180		Brief report: human figure drawings by children with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Hui Keow Lim, Virginia Slaughter		Twenty-nine children with Asperger's syndrome and 28 typically developing children, matched on gender, chronological age and nonverbal IQ, were asked to produce a free drawing, then requested to draw a person, a house and a tree. The drawings were scored using standardized procedures for assessing accuracy, detail and complexity. There were no differences between the diagnostic groups on the tree or house drawing scores. The human figure drawing scores of children with Asperger's syndrome were significantly lower than those of the typically developing children, and there was a positive correlation between human figure drawing scores and communication sub-scores on the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, for the Asperger's group. These results suggest that the selective deficit in generating human figure representations may derive from a relative lack of interest in the social world, and/or limited practice in drawing people.

17920642		Avoidance of emotionally arousing stimuli predicts social-perceptual impairment in Asperger's syndrome.	Neuropsychologia	2008	Ben Corden, Rebecca Chilvers, David Skuse		We combined eye-tracking technology with a test of facial affect recognition and a measure of self-reported social anxiety in order to explore the aetiology of social-perceptual deficits in Asperger's syndrome (AS). Compared to controls matched for age, IQ and visual-perceptual ability, we found a group of AS adults was impaired in their recognition of fearful and sad expressions and spent significantly less time fixating the eye region of all faces. For AS subjects, but not controls, the extent of the failure to fixate the eyes predicted the degree of impairment at recognising fearful expressions. In addition, poor fear recognition and reduced fixation of the eyes were independently associated with greater levels of social anxiety in AS individuals. These findings support the hypothesis that avoidance of emotionally arousing stimuli, such as eyes, contributes to social-perceptual impairment in AS. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with theories implicating amygdala-mediated over-arousal and anxiety in the development of these social-perceptual deficits.
17920641		Robotic movement elicits visuomotor priming in children with autism.	Neuropsychologia	2008	Andrea C Pierno, Morena Mari, Dean Lusher, Umberto Castiello		The ability to understand another person's action and, if needed, to imitate that action, is a core component of human social behaviour. Imitation skills have attracted particular attention in the search for the underlying causes of the social difficulties that characterize autism. In recent years, it has been reported that people with autism can bypass some of their social deficits by interacting with robots. However, the robot preference in terms of imitation has yet to be proved. Here we provide empirical evidence that interaction with robots can trigger imitative behaviour in children with autism. We compared a group of high functioning children with autism with a group of typically developing children in a visuomotor priming experiment. Participants were requested to observe either a human or a robotic arm model performing a reach-to-grasp action towards a spherical object. Subsequently, the observers were asked to perform the same action towards the same object. Two 'control' conditions in which participants performed the movement in the presence of either the static human or robot model were also included. Kinematic analysis was conducted on the reach-to-grasp action performed by the observer. Our results show that children with autism were facilitated - as revealed by a faster movement duration and an anticipated peak velocity - when primed by a robotic but not by a human arm movement. The opposite pattern was found for normal children. The present results show that interaction with robots has an effect on visuomotor priming processes. These findings suggest that in children with autism the neural mechanism underlying the coding of observed actions might be tailored to process socially simpler stimuli.

17917804		Diagnostic validity of sensory over-responsivity: a review of the literature and case reports.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Stacey Reynolds, Shelly J Lane		Atypical responses to sensory stimulation are frequently reported to co-occur with diagnoses such as autism, ADHD, and Fragile-X syndrome. It has also been suggested that children and adults may present with atypical sensory responses while failing to meet the criteria for other medical or psychological diagnoses. This may be particularly true for individuals with over-responsivity to sensation. This article reviews the literature related to sensory over-responsivity and presents three pediatric cases that present a profile of having sensory over-responsivity without a co-occurring diagnosis. Findings from these cases provide very preliminary evidence to support the suggestion that sensory over-responsivity can occur as a sole diagnosis. Within this small group, tactile over-responsivity was the most common and pervasive form of this condition.
17916798		Analysis of glycoproteins in human serum by means of glycospecific magnetic bead separation and LC-MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis with automated glycopeptide detection.	Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT	2007	Katrin Sparbier, Arndt Asperger, Anja Resemann, Irina Kessler, Sonja Koch, Thomas Wenzel, Günter Stein, Lars Vorwerg, Detlev Suckau, Markus Kostrzewa		Comprehensive proteomic analyses require efficient and selective pre-fractionation to facilitate analysis of post-translationally modified peptides and proteins, and automated analysis workflows enabling the detection, identification, and structural characterization of the corresponding peptide modifications. Human serum contains a high number of glycoproteins, comprising several orders of magnitude in concentration. Thereby, isolation and subsequent identification of low-abundant glycoproteins from serum is a challenging task. selective capturing of glycopeptides and -proteins was attained by means of magnetic particles specifically functionalized with lectins or boronic acids that bind to various structural motifs. Human serum was incubated with differentially functionalized magnetic micro-particles (lectins or boronic acids), and isolated proteins were digested with trypsin. Subsequently, the resulting complex mixture of peptides and glycopeptides was subjected to LC-MALDI analysis and database searching. In parallel, a second magnetic bead capturing was performed on the peptide level to separate and analyze by LC-MALDI intact glycopeptides, both peptide sequence and glycan structure. Detection of glycopeptides was achieved by means of a software algorithm that allows extraction and characterization of potential glycopeptide candidates from large LC-MALDI-MS/MS data sets, based on N-glycopeptide-specific fragmentation patterns and characteristic fragment mass peaks, respectively. By means of fast and simple glycospecific capturing applied in conjunction with extensive LC-MALDI-MS/MS analysis and novel data analysis tools, a high number of low-abundant proteins were identified, comprising known or predicted glycosylation sites. According to the specific binding preferences of the different types of beads, complementary results were obtained from the experiments using either magnetic ConA-, LCA-, WGA-, and boronic acid beads, respectively.
17896229		The use of genetic epidemiology to guide classification in child and adult psychopathology.	International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England)	2007	Peter Szatmari, Julie White, Kathleen R Merikangas		The goal of this paper is to illustrate the application of the tools of genetic epidemiology, particularly the family study method, to inform the classification of psychiatric disorders in adults and children. The first section describes family studies of adults designed to investigate the causes of comorbidity of anxiety and depression. The analysis of familial traits provides stronger evidence for the validity of certain sub-types of anxiety and mood disorders that co-occur within the same individual and within families. The second section presents an example of the use of the family study method to examine the validity of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). A review of these studies suggests that the most consistently familial traits in ASD are language and communication skills, insistence on sameness and non-verbal IQ. These are also the traits most commonly associated with the differentiation of autism from Asperger disorder and PDDNOS using both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. From these data, a new classification system of the ASDs is proposed based on these familial traits.
17885828		Peer victimization in adolescents and young adults diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome: a link to depressive symptomatology, anxiety symptomatology and suicidal ideation.	Issues in comprehensive pediatric nursing	2007	Oren Shtayermman	Rhode Island College, School of Social Work, Providence, Rhode Island 02908, USA. oshtayermman@ric.edu	The present exploratory study examined the level of peer victimization, depressive symptomatology, anxiety symptomatology, and level of suicidal ideation among adolescents and young adults diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (AS). This cross-sectional study used a self-administrated mail questionnaire and a Web-based questionnaire. The study included two samples. The first sample used snowball sampling, beginning with parents of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with AS who participated in a qualitative study conducted in 2002. The second sample consisted of a volunteer sample of parents who accessed Web sites for parents and individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. A total sample of 10 adolescents and young adults diagnosed with AS was obtained. The high proportion of respondents with scores above the cutoff point on the overt victimization and relational victimization scales suggests that these adolescents and young adults experienced high levels of victimization. Of the sample, 20 percent met criteria for a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, 30 percent met criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and 50 percent had clinically significant level of suicidal ideation.
17882540		Brief report: Emotional processing in high-functioning autism--physiological reactivity and affective report.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Sven Bölte, Sabine Feineis-Matthews, Fritz Poustka		This study examined physiological response and affective report in 10 adult individuals with autism and 10 typically developing controls. An emotion induction paradigm using stimuli from the International Affective Picture System was applied. Blood pressure, heart and self-ratings of experienced valence (pleasure), arousal and dominance (control) were assessed during the experiment. Physiological response profiles correlated low to significantly negative between groups. Individuals with autism experienced less arousal when viewing sad pictures but higher arousal while processing neutral stimuli. In addition, they reported more control than the normative group when viewing fearful and sad stimuli. Findings indicate altered physiological reactivity and affective report in autism, which may be related to more general impairments in socio-emotional functioning.
17880641		Dyspraxia in autism: association with motor, social, and communicative deficits.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2007	M A Dziuk, J C Gidley Larson, A Apostu, E M Mahone, M B Denckla, S H Mostofsky		Impaired performance of skilled gestures, referred to as dyspraxia, is consistently reported in children with autism; however, its neurological basis is not well understood. Basic motor skill deficits are also observed in children with autism and it is unclear whether dyspraxia observed in children with autism can be accounted for by problems with motor skills. Forty-seven high-functioning children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD), autism, or Asperger syndrome (43 males, four females; mean age 10y 7m [SD 1y 10m], mean Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) 99.4 [SD 15.9]), and 47 typically developing (TD) controls (41 males, six females; mean age 10y 6m [SD 1y 5m], mean FSIQ 113.8 [SD 12.3], age range 8-4y) completed: (1) the Physical and Neurological Assessment of Subtle Signs, an examination of basic motor skills standardized for children, and (2) a praxis examination that included gestures to command, to imitation, and with tool-use. Hierarchical regression was used to examine the association between basic motor skill performance (i.e. times to complete repetitive limb movements) and praxis performance (total praxis errors). After controlling for age and IQ, basic motor skill was a significant predictor of performance on praxis examination. Nevertheless, the ASD group continued to show significantly poorer praxis than controls after accounting for basic motor skill. Furthermore, praxis performance was a strong predictor of the defining features of autism, measured using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, and this correlation remained significant after accounting for basic motor skill. Results indicate that dyspraxia in autism cannot be entirely accounted for by impairments in basic motor skills, suggesting the presence of additional contributory factors. Furthermore, praxis in children with autism is strongly correlated with the social, communicative, and behavioral impairments that define the disorder, suggesting that dyspraxia may be a core feature of autism or a marker of the neurological abnormalities underlying the disorder.
17879650		Motor and visuomotor skills of children with Asperger's disorder: preliminary findings.	Perceptual and motor skills	2007	Christopher Lopata, Ellen M Hamm, Martin A Volker, Jill E Sowinski		While motor clumsiness is frequently described as an associated feature of Asperger's Disorder, little research has examined specific motor skills and the relation among aspects of motor performance in this population. The present purpose was to present preliminary findings for three aspects of Asperger's: the presence and magnitude of gross motor and fine motor deficits, the presence and magnitude of visuomotor deficits, and the relation between motor functioning and visuomotor skills. 17 boys, 6 to 13 years old, with Asperger's were tested using standardized measures of gross, fine, and visuomotor skills. Statistically significant deficits were found for the sample's scores compared with values for the general population (using one-sample t tests), but none for fine motor vs gross motor skills (using a dependent sample t test). Significant positive correlations were found for gross motor skills with visuomotor skills (.73) and for fine motor skills with visuomotor skills (.71). Tentative suggestions for clinical assessment were proposed.
17879610		[A preliminary fMRI study of moral judgment task in high functioning autistic children].	No to hattatsu = Brain and development	2007	Hirotoshi Hiraishi, Toshiaki Hashimoto, Kenji Mori, Hiromichi Ito, Masafumi Harada		"Autistic patients show social cognitive disorders and hardly recognize their situations. This means it is difficult for them to obey rules or conform to customs. Humans have social intelligence thought to be related to a network connected to amygdala, the orbito-frontal cortex, and the superior temporal gyrus. It has been reported that normal participants judged morality in dilemma sentences through which the medial orbito-frontal cortex and the right lateral prefrontal cortex were activated. However, where autism is concerned, there has been no fMRI study during the moral judgment task. The study herein showed changes of autistic brain areas related to moral judgment. This study included one high-functioning autistic child, one Asperger's syndrome child, and three normal children. Pictures of social situations were painted and the children present were asked to judge whether the contents were moral or immoral. The results of fMRI demonstrated the orbito-frontal cortex was active in normal children but not active in the autistic children with regard to moral judgment. This suggested autistic people have functional disorders in this area. BA11 and BA22 were activated in the control group and these areas are thought to be related to sociality and ""theory of mind"". Furthermore, BA38 was activated in one control and this area is also related to ""theory of mind"" and emotions. Moral judgments about personal affairs activate brain areas related to emotions (bilateral medial frontal gyri, bilateral cingulated gyri and bilateral angular gyri) and moral judgments about public affairs activate brain areas related to working memory (left medial frontal gyrus and bilateral temporal cortices). Based on the results above, we think moral judgment is related to ""theory of mind"" and social cognition, and shares a common sense processing mechanism. Recently Greene et al. reported that the prefrontal cortex was active during moral judgment in an fMRI study of normally developed people. Their result reinforces our results."
17879153		A preliminary study on screening prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder in schoolchildren in Iran.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Ahmad Ghanizadeh	Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Hafez Hospital, Shiraz, Iran. ghanizad@sina.tums.ac.ir	To study prevalence rates of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) symptoms and differences between subtypes in school age Iranian children. A random sample of 2,000 school age children from both genders was selected. A parent-completed, DSM-IV-referenced rating scale of PDD symptoms was used. About 1.9% of the sample obtained screening cutoff scores for probable autistic disorder and 0.5 for probable asperger's disorder. The rate of probable PDD was not more in girls than the boys. The rate of suspected cases of PDD in Iran is very high and probable autistic disorder is not gender related. It shows the need for more consideration of PDD in the mental health programs planning.
17879152		Brief report: The use of WAIS-III in adults with HFA and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Antoinette A Spek, Evert M Scholte, Ina A van Berckelaer-Onnes		The WAIS III was administered to 16 adults with high functioning autism (HFA) and 27 adults with Asperger syndrome. Differences between Verbal Intelligence (VIQ) and Performance Intelligence (PIQ) were not found. Processing Speed problems in people with HFA appeared. At the subtest level, the Asperger syndrome group performed weak on Digit Span. Comprehension and Block Design were relative strengths. In the HFA group, performance on Digit-Symbol Coding and Symbol Search was relatively poor. Strengths were found on Information and Matrix Reasoning. The results suggest that the VIQ-PIQ difference cannot distinguish between HFA and Asperger syndrome. WAIS III Factor Scale and Subtest patterning provides a more valid indicator.
17854448		Curing dyslexia and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder by training motor co-ordination: miracle or myth?	Journal of paediatrics and child health	2007	Dorothy V M Bishop	Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford, UK. dorothy.bishop@psy.ox.ac.uk	Dore Achievement Centres are springing up world-wide with a mission to cure cerebellar developmental delay, thought to be the cause of dyslexia, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, dyspraxia and Asperger's syndrome. Remarkable success is claimed for an exercise-based treatment that is designed to accelerate cerebellar development. Unfortunately, the published studies are seriously flawed. On measures where control data are available, there is no credible evidence of significant gains in literacy associated with this intervention. There are no published studies on efficacy with the clinical groups for whom the programme is advocated. It is important that family practitioners and paediatricians are aware that the claims made for this expensive treatment are misleading.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	David Allen, Carys Evans, Andrew Hider, Sarah Hawkins, Helen Peckett, Hugh Morgan		Considerable speculation is evident both within the scientific literature and popular media regarding possible links between Asperger syndrome and offending. A survey methodology that utilised quantitative data collection was employed to investigate the prevalence of offending behaviour amongst adults with Asperger Syndrome in a large geographical area of South Wales, UK; qualitative interviews were then conducted with a sub-sample of those identified. A small number of participants meeting the study criteria were identified. For those who had offended, their experience of the criminal justice system was essentially negative. Possible implications of the results were discussed.

By providing a coherent conceptual framework, affective neuroscience is increasingly able to provide a mechanistic explanatory understanding of current therapies and is driving the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
17764946		Abnormal adaptive face-coding mechanisms in children with autism spectrum disorder.	Current biology : CB	2007	Elizabeth Pellicano, Linda Jeffery, David Burr, Gillian Rhodes		In low-level vision, exquisite sensitivity to variation in luminance is achieved by adaptive mechanisms that adjust neural sensitivity to the prevailing luminance level. In high-level vision, adaptive mechanisms contribute to our remarkable ability to distinguish thousands of similar faces [1]. A clear example of this sort of adaptive coding is the face-identity aftereffect [2, 3, 4, 5], in which adaptation to a particular face biases perception toward the opposite identity. Here we investigated face adaptation in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by asking them to discriminate between two face identities, with and without prior adaptation to opposite-identity faces. The ASD group discriminated the identities with the same precision as did the age- and ability-matched control group, showing that face identification per se was unimpaired. However, children with ASD showed significantly less adaptation than did their typical peers, with the amount of adaptation correlating significantly with current symptomatology, and face aftereffects of children with elevated symptoms only one third those of controls. These results show that although children with ASD can learn a simple discrimination between two identities, adaptive face-coding mechanisms are severely compromised, offering a new explanation for previously reported face-perception difficulties [6, 7, 8] and possibly for some of the core social deficits in ASD [9, 10].

Language skills of 19 children with AS and 45 with HFA were assessed at 4-6 years of age (Time 1) and 2 years later (Time 2). Children's symptoms and functional outcome scores were assessed every 2 years (Times 3, 4, and 5) until ages 15-17 years old. Regression analysis revealed that specific language impairment at time 2 more often accounted for the greatest variation in outcome scores in adolescence than the standard diagnosis of AS versus HFA based on history of language delay. Diagnostic implications are discussed."
17715591		A neurobehavioral examination of individuals with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder using a fronto-striatal model of dysfunction.	Behavioral and cognitive neuroscience reviews	2002	Nicole J Rinehart, John L Bradshaw, Bruce J Tonge, Avril V Brereton, Mark A Bellgrove		The repetitive, stereotyped, and obsessive behaviors that characterize autism may in part be attributable to disruption of the region of the fronto-striatal system, which mediates executive abilities. Neuropsychological testing has shown that children with autism exhibit set-shifting deficiencies on tests such as the Wisconsin Card Sorting task but show normal inhibitory ability on variants of the Stroop color-word test. According to Minshew and Goldstein's multiple primary deficit theory, the complexity of the executive functioning task is important in determining the performance of individuals with autism. This study employed a visual-spatial task (with a Stroop-type component) to examine the integrity of executive functioning, in particular inhibition, in autism (n = 12) and Asperger's disorder (n = 12) under increasing levels of cognitive complexity. Whereas the Asperger's disorder group performed similarly to age- and IQ-matched control participants, even at the higher levels of cognitive complexity, the high-functioning autism group displayed inhibitory deficits specifically associated with increasing cognitive load.

Because his muscle biopsy showed a mosaic pattern of fibers staining intensely with the succinate dehydrogenase reaction but not at all with the cytochrome c oxidase reaction, we sequenced his mitochondrial DNA and found a novel mutation (C14680A) in the gene for tRNAGlu. The mutation was present in accessible tissues from the asymptomatic mother but not from a brother with Asperger syndrome. These data expand the clinical heterogeneity of mutations in this mitochondrial gene.

17710522		Dissociation between key processes of social cognition in autism: impaired mentalizing but intact sense of agency.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Nicole David, Astrid Gawronski, Natacha S Santos, Wolfgang Huff, Fritz-Georg Lehnhardt, Albert Newen, Kai Vogeley		Deficits in social cognition and interaction, such as in mentalizing and imitation behavior, are hallmark features of autism spectrum disorders. Both imitation and mentalizing are at the core of the sense of agency, the awareness that we are the initiators of our own behavior. Little evidence exists regarding the sense of agency in autism. Thus, we compared high-functioning adults with autism to healthy control subjects using an action monitoring and attribution task. Subjects with autism did not show deficits in this task, yet they showed significant mentalizing deficits. Our findings indicate a dissociation between the sense of agency and ascription of mental states in autism. We propose that social-cognitive deficits in autism may arise on a higher level than that of action monitoring and awareness.
17682931		Dream content analysis in persons with an autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Anne-Marie Daoust, Félix-Antoine Lusignan, Claude M J Braun, Laurent Mottron, Roger Godbout		Dream questionnaires were completed by 28 young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participants. Seventy-nine typically developed individual served as the control group. In a subset of 17 persons with ASD and 11 controls matched for verbal IQ, dream narratives were obtained following REM sleep awakenings in a sleep laboratory. Questionnaires revealed that participants with ASD, compared to controls, had fewer recollections of dreaming, fewer bad dreams and fewer emotions. In the sleep laboratory, dream content narratives following REM sleep awakenings were shorter in ASD participants than in controls. ASD participants also reported fewer settings, objects, characters, social interactions, activities, and emotions. It is concluded that these characteristics of dreaming in ASD may reflect neurocognitive dimensions specific to this condition.
17675925		[Investigation of the behavioural phenotype of parents of autistic children through the new FAQ self-report].	L'Encephale	2007	H Piana, C Fortin, M Noulhiane, B Golse, L Robel		Autism is characterized by impairments in communication and socialization and by the presence of circumscribed and stereotyped interest. Previous studies have shown that genetic mechanisms may enhance the vulnerability to autism. These mechanisms are complex and may involve the combination of several genes, in interaction with the environment. The genetic mechanism involved in the vulnerability to autism may also concern other disorders and some features, with enhanced prevalence in relatives of autistic patients. It has been shown, for example, that the frequency of language disorders or serial difficulties is increased in the siblings of autistic patients. Characterization and taking into account the presence of such phenotypic traits in the relations may help in understanding the results of genetic studies, in particular association studies in sibling pairs or trios.
17674186		Parent-rated anxiety symptoms in children with pervasive developmental disorders: frequency and association with core autism symptoms and cognitive functioning.	Journal of abnormal child psychology	2008	Denis G Sukhodolsky, Lawrence Scahill, Kenneth D Gadow, L Eugene Arnold, Michael G Aman, Christopher J McDougle, James T McCracken, Elaine Tierney, Susan Williams White, Luc Lecavalier, Benedetto Vitiello		In addition to the core symptoms, children with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) often exhibit other problem behaviors such as aggression, hyperactivity, and anxiety, which can contribute to overall impairment and, therefore, become the focus of clinical attention. Limited data are available on the prevalence of anxiety in these children. We examined frequency and correlates of parent-rated anxiety symptoms in a large sample of children with PDD.
17666231		Autism spectrum disorders in early childhood: an overview for practicing physicians.	Primary care	2007	James E Carr, Linda A LeBlanc		Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) affect approximately 1 in 166 children in the United States, making it likely for the average physician to encounter patients with ASDs in his or her practice. In particular, pediatricians and developmental neurologists play a critical role in early identification, resource referrals, and management of a variety of comorbid physical and medical concerns. This article reviews the current literature on ASDs and provides recommendations for practice in areas critical to the provision of medical services.
17665298		Communicative competence and metalinguistic ability: performance by children and adults with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Fiona M Lewis, Bruce E Murdoch, Gail C Woodyatt		The Test of Language Competence-Expanded Edition (TLC-E) was administered to children and adults with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Relative to controls, those with ASD were less competent on a range of TLC-E tasks. No differences were found for either child or adult ASD groups on any of the TLC-E measures when re-classified as Asperger syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA) using DSM-IV language criterion. Hierarchical cluster analyses of individuals with ASD identified subgroups within the spectrum. The use of developmental language history as an identifying marker in autism is questioned. The findings suggest that comprehensive language assessments on individuals with ASD can provide clinically relevant information regarding the heterogeneity of language skills within the autistic spectrum.
17665296		Brief report: imitation of meaningless gestures in individuals with Asperger syndrome and High-Functioning Autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Heidi Stieglitz Ham, Martin Corley, Gnanathusharan Rajendran, Jean Carletta, Sara Swanson		Nineteen people with Asperger syndrome (AS)/High-Functioning Autism (HFA) (ages 7-15) were tested on imitation of two types of meaningless gesture: hand postures and finger positions. The individuals with AS/HFA achieved lower scores in the imitation of both hand and finger positions relative to a matched neurotypical group. The between-group difference was primarily accounted for by performance on a test of visual motor integration, together with a hand imitation deficit which was specifically due to errors in body part orientation. Our findings implicate both visuomotor processes (Damasio and Maurer, 1978) and self-other mapping (Rogers and Pennington, 1991) in ASD imitation deficits. Following Goldenberg (1999), we propose that difficulties with body part orientation may underlie problems in meaningless gesture imitation.
17641963		Brief report: abnormal association between the thalamus and brain size in Asperger's disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Antonio Y Hardan, Ragy R Girgis, Jason Adams, Andrew R Gilbert, Nadine M Melhem, Matcheri S Keshavan, Nancy J Minshew		The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between thalamic volume and brain size in individuals with Asperger's disorder (ASP). Volumetric measurements of the thalamus were performed on MRI scans obtained from 12 individuals with ASP (age range: 10-35 years) and 12 healthy controls (age range: 9-33 years). A positive correlation was found between total brain volume and thalamic size in controls, but not in ASP subjects. This occurred in the absence of differences in mean thalamic volumes between the study groups. Findings from this investigation point to an abnormal relationship between the thalamus and its projection areas in ASP and are consistent with similar studies in autism, supporting that these disorders are qualitatively similar and possibly quantitatively different.
17641962		Social skills interventions for children with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism: a review and recommendations.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Patricia A Rao, Deborah C Beidel, Michael J Murray		"This paper reviews the literature examining social skills training (SST) programs for youth with AS/HFA, with an emphasis on critically evaluating efficacy and highlighting areas of future research. The review highlights the disparity between SST programs described in the extant literature, including lack of a universal definition of social skills, various levels of intensity and duration of treatment, divergent theoretical backgrounds, and variety in services provided in clinic or classroom settings. Overall, it is clear that, despite their widespread clinical use, empirical support for SST programs for children with AS/HFA is minimal at this time. Based on this critical review, a ""roadmap"" for future research, consistent with recommendations put forth by a leading group of autism researchers, is presented."

Biological psychiatry	2007	Taro Endo, Toshiki Shioiri, Hideaki Kitamura, Teruo Kimura, Sumio Endo, Naio Masuzawa, Toshiyuki Someya		Although several previous studies have been conducted, the neural basis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is poorly understood. The objective of the present study was to determine whether individuals with ASD have altered brain chemical metabolites and whether such alterations are related to their autistic symptoms.
17629782		A new computerised advanced theory of mind measure for children with Asperger syndrome: the ATOMIC.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Renae B Beaumont, Kate Sofronoff		This study examined the ability of children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) to attribute mental states to characters in a new computerised, advanced theory of mind measure: The Animated Theory of Mind Inventory for Children (ATOMIC). Results showed that children with AS matched on IQ, verbal comprehension, age and gender performed equivalently on central coherence questions, but more poorly on the theory of mind questions compared with controls. A significant relationship was found between performance on ATOMIC and accuracy of mental state explanations provided on (Happé's, Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 24, 129-154, 1994) Strange Stories Task, supporting the validity of the new measure. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.
17624076		Improving written language performance of adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of applied behavior analysis	2007	Monica E Delano	205 Stone Building, Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida 32306, USA. delano@coe.fsu.edu	The effects of a multicomponent intervention involving self-regulated strategy development delivered via video self-modeling on the written language performance of 3 students with Asperger syndrome were examined. During intervention sessions, each student watched a video of himself performing strategies for increasing the number of words written and the number of functional essay elements. He then wrote a persuasive essay. The number of words written and number of functional essay elements included in each essay were measured. Each student demonstrated gains in the number of words written and number of functional essay elements. Maintenance of treatment effects at follow-up varied across targets and participants. Implications for future research are suggested.
17619132		Is the linguistic content of speech less salient than its perceptual features in autism?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Anna Järvinen-Pasley, John Pasley, Pamela Heaton		Open-ended tasks are rarely used to investigate cognition in autism. No known studies have directly examined whether increased attention to the perceptual level of speech in autism might contribute to a reduced tendency to process language meaningfully. The present study investigated linguistic versus perceptual speech processing preferences. Children with autism and controls were tested on a quasi-open-format paradigm, in which speech stimuli contained competing linguistic and perceptual information, and could be processed at either level. Relative to controls, children with autism exhibited superior perceptual processing of speech. However, whilst their tendency to preferentially process linguistic rather than perceptual information was weaker than that of controls, it was nevertheless their primary processing mode. Implications for language acquisition in autism are discussed.
17616796		Clinical utility of autism spectrum disorder scoring algorithms for the child symptom inventory-4.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Kenneth D Gadow, Joseph Schwartz, Carla Devincent, Greg Strong, Simone Cuva		Few studies examine the clinical utility of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) rating scales for screening referrals to child psychiatry clinics. Parents/teachers from Long Island, NY, completed the Child Symptom Inventory-4, a DSM-IV-referenced rating scale for 6- to 12-year-old clinical referrals with an ASD (N = 317) or nonASD psychiatric (N = 191) diagnosis. Two separate groups of children attending public school, regular education classes in the same geographic area were also rated by their parents (N = 446) and teachers (N = 464). Stepwise forward regression generated a scoring algorithm based on a subset of all CSI-4 items that best differentiated ASD from nonASD children. ROC analyses indicated high levels of sensitivity/specificity for recommended ASD cutoff scores for parent and teacher ratings.
17615427		Pervasive developmental disorders and criminal behaviour: a case control study.	International journal of offender therapy and comparative criminology	2008	Svend Erik Mouridsen, Bente Rich, Torben Isager, Niels Jørgen Nedergaard		The prevalence and pattern of criminal behaviour in a population of 313 former child psychiatric in-patients with pervasive developmental disorders were studied. The patients were divided into three subgroups and compared with 933 matched controls from the general population. Age at follow-up was between 25 years and 59 years. An account of convictions in the nationwide Danish Register of Criminality was used as a measure of criminal behaviour. Among 113 cases with childhood autism, .9% had been convicted. In atypical autism (n=86) and Asperger's syndrome (n=114) the percentages were 8.1% and 18.4%, respectively. The corresponding rate of convictions in the comparison groups was 18.9%, 14.7%, and 19.6% respectively. Particular attention is given to arson in Asperger's syndrome (p= .0009).
17610152		A scale to assist the diagnosis of autism and Asperger's disorder in adults (RAADS): a pilot study.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Riva Ariella Ritvo, Edward R Ritvo, Donald Guthrie, Arthur Yuwiler, Max Joseph Ritvo, Leo Weisbender		An empirically based 78 question self-rating scale based on DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10 criteria was developed to assist clinicians' diagnosis of adults with autism and Asperger's Disorder-the Ritvo Autism and Asperger's Diagnostic Scale (RAADS). It was standardized on 17 autistic and 20 Asperger's Disorder and 57 comparison subjects. Both autistic and Asperger's groups scored significantly higher than comparison groups with no overlap; sensitivity, specificity, and content validity equaled one. Cronbach's alpha coefficients of internal consistency of three subscales were satisfactory. Gender, age, and diagnostic categories were not significantly associated factors. The RAADS can be administered and scored in less than an hour and may be useful as a clinical scale to assist identification of autism and Asperger's Disorder in adults. The RAADS does not distinguish between autism and Asperger's Disorder.

17605098		Brief report: emerging services for children with autism spectrum disorders in Hong Kong (1960-2004).	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Virginia C N Wong, Stella L H Hui		Early identification of autistic features in any child is important because there is potential for improvement by means of interventional, educational, or rehabilitative programs. Appropriate diagnosis of autism requires a dual-level approach--routine developmental surveillance and screening, and diagnosis and evaluation of autism. The historical emergence of a model of services for children with autism in Hong Kong arose because of increasing awareness, increasing prevalence, and pressure from parents and support groups. The university-based Autism Research Program at the University of Hong Kong serves as an example of an integrated center for research, teaching, and training in autism. The period from 1960 to 2004 is reviewed.
17604952		Parents of children with Asperger syndrome or with learning disabilities: family environment and social support.	Research in developmental disabilities	2008	Tali Heiman, Ornit Berger		The study examined the family environment and perceived social support of 33 parents with a child diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and 43 parents with a child with learning disability, which were compared to 45 parents of children without disabilities as a control group. Parents completed the Family Environment Scale and Social Support Scale questionnaires. The comparison revealed significant differences for expressiveness and family system organization and for social support. Parents with an Asperger child perceived their family's expressive feelings as lower and the family organization as higher, and perceived their friendships and other support as lower than the other groups of parent. Parents of the control group reported the highest family support. The study highlighted the need for additional social support for parents with a child with special needs, and accentuated the importance of developing awareness and intervention programs to facilitate parents' coping abilities and their family interactions.
17597426		Asperger's disorder in adulthood: a case report.	Actas espanolas de psiquiatria	2007	Y Alonso, M C Miralles, B Mulet, V Serret		Asperger's disorder is a pervasive development disorder. It involves qualitative disorders in social relationship and communication as well as restricted and repetitive interests and activities, with no delay in language acquisition. Although Asperger's disorder is an illness that begins in childhood, its diagnosis may frequently not be done until later stages. The case presented is about a 21 year old man with a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder who, after several admissions, was sent to the Rehabilitation Hospital Unit for stabilization and diagnostic study given the atypical features of his case. The psychopathological examination showed disorders in social relationships, psychomotricity and communications that had begun in his childhood. All these data, and the results of the biomedical and psychological diagnostic tests oriented us towards the presence of a dual diagnosis of Asperger's disorder and schizoaffective disorder. The presence of common symptoms between the AD and other psychiatric diseases as well as the possible existence of comorbidity may lead to an incorrect or late diagnosis.
17594137		Size sequencing as a window on executive control in children with autism and Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Margaret McGonigle-Chalmers, Kimberly Bodner, Alicia Fox-Pitt, Laura Nicholson		A study is reported in which size sequencing on a touch screen is used as a measure of executive control in 20 high-functioning children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD). The data show a significant and age-independent effect of the length of sequence that can be executed without errors by these children, in comparison with a chronologically age-matched group of children with normal development. Error data and reaction times are analysed and are interpreted as revealing a constraint on the prospective component of working memory in children on the autistic spectrum even when there is no change in goal or perceptual set. It is concluded that the size sequencing paradigm is an effective measure of executive difficulties associated with autism.
17588757		Mitochondrial myopathy associated with a novel mutation in mtDNA.	Neuromuscular disorders : NMD	2007	Jacklyn Pancrudo, Sara Shanske, Jorida Coku, J Lu, Rebecca Mardach, Orhan Akman, Sindu Krishna, Eduardo Bonilla, Salvatore DiMauro		A 6-year-old boy had progressive muscle weakness since age 4 and emotional problems diagnosed as Asperger syndrome. His mother and two older siblings are in good health and there is no family history of neuromuscular disorders. Muscle biopsy showed ragged-red and cytochrome coxidase (COX)-negative fibers. Respiratory chain activities were reduced for all enzymes containing mtDNA-encoded subunits, especially COX. Sequence analysis of the 22 tRNA genes revealed a novel G10406A base substitution, which was heteroplasmic in multiple tissues of the patient by RFLP analysis (muscle, 96%; urinary sediment, 94%; cheek mucosa, 36%; blood, 29%). The mutation was not detected in any accessible tissues from his mother or siblings. It appears that this mutation arose de novo in the proband, probably early in embryogenesis.
17588199		Broader autism phenotype in parents of autistic children: reality or myth?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Anke M Scheeren, Johannes E A Stauder		The finding that relatives of individuals with autism show mild autistic traits is referred to as the broader autism phenotype (BAP). In the current study, 25 parents with a child with high-functioning autism and 25 parents with typically developed children were compared on: (1) the Block Design Test, (2) the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), and (3) a reaction time task to examine reflexive covert visual orienting to social (eyes) and non-social (arrows) cues. The parent groups were scored similar on the Block Design Test and the AQ. However, fathers with an autistic child demonstrated a different reaction time pattern and responded slower on the social cues than control fathers. These results partly support and further elaborate on the BAP in parents with an autistic child.
17584979		Stress sensitization in schizophrenia.	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2007	Kunio Yuii, Michio Suzuki, Masayoshi Kurachi		It is well known that environmental factors, such as early life events, perinatal damage, and urbanicity, which interact with multiple genes, induces persistent sensitization to stress possibly through an imbalance in interactions between dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. This stress sensitization may be critical in the development or relapse of schizophrenia. The neural correlates of a negative mood might be impaired, resulting in stress sensitization and difficulties in social adjustment (Dr. Habel). Urbanicity is associated with later schizophrenia. Metabolic stress induces stress sensitization via dysregulation of dopaminergic and/or noradrenergic systems in activated HVA and cortical response (Dr. Marcelis). The glutamatergic regulation activates HPA axis in stress response (Dr. Zelena). Ameloblast activity in human molar's enamel slowed by exposure to stress, and the segment of enamel rods is smaller, making a particular dark line. Stress sensitization may be induced at the age of 10.5 to 11.5 years resulting from severe emotional stress at the age of 10.5 to 11.5 years (Dr. Yui). It has been reported that volume reductions in the amygdala, hippocampus, superior temporal gyrus, and anterior parietal cortex common to both patient groups may represent the vulnerability to schizophrenia, while volume loss of the prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, cingulate, insula, and fusiform cortex preferentially observed in schizophrenia may be critical for overt manifestation of psychosis (Dr. Suzuki).

17579608		Association of DISC1 with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Molecular psychiatry	2008	H Kilpinen, T Ylisaukko-Oja, W Hennah, O M Palo, T Varilo, R Vanhala, T Nieminen-von Wendt, L von Wendt, T Paunio, L Peltonen		The DISC1 gene at 1q42 has generated considerable interest in various psychiatric diseases, since a balanced translocation interrupting the gene was found to cosegregate with schizophrenia and related mental illnesses in a large Scottish pedigree. To date, linkage and association findings to this locus have been replicated in several study samples ascertained for psychotic disorders. However, the biological function of DISC1 in neuronal development would suggest a potential role for this gene also in other, early onset neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we have addressed the allelic diversity of the DISC1, DISC2 and TRAX genes, clustered in 1q42, in Finnish families ascertained for infantile autism (97 families, n(affected)=138) and Asperger syndrome (29 families, n(affected)=143). We established association between autism and a DISC1 intragenic microsatellite (D1S2709; P=0.004). In addition, evidence for association to Asperger syndrome was observed with an intragenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of DISC1 (rs1322784; P=0.0058), as well as with a three-SNP haplotype (P=0.0013) overlapping the HEP3 haplotype, that was previously observed to associate with schizophrenia in Finnish families. The strongest associations were obtained with broad diagnostic categories for both disorders and with affected males only, in agreement with the previous sex-dependent effects reported for DISC1. These results would further support the involvement of DISC1 gene also in the etiopathogenesis of early onset neuropsychiatric disorders.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Gabriela Walker	Department of Communication Sciences and Special Education, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA. gab_rielaa@yahoo.com	A review of 22 empirical studies examining the use of constant (CTD) and progressive (PTD) time delay procedures employed with children with autism frames an indirect analysis of the demographic, procedural, methodological, and outcome parameters of existing research. None of the previous manuscripts compared the two response prompting procedures. This review suggests that the effectiveness of the two procedures is similar on some variables. However, the CTD procedure resulted in more errors to criterion, a greater magnitude of procedural modifications, and in a delayed moment of transfer of stimulus control than in the PTD studies. Conclusions may influence clinical and educational practices and indicate a need for research.
17546490		Enhancing the conversation skills of a boy with Asperger's Disorder through Social Stories and video modeling.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Dorothy Scattone	Department of Pediatrics, Division of Child Development and Behavioral Medicine, The University of Mississippi Medical Center, 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216-4505, USA. dscattone@ped.umsmed.edu	This study combined Social Stories with video modeling in an effort to enhance the conversation skills of a boy with Asperger's Disorder. Treatment consisted of two components: (a) observation of video taped Social Stories that included two adults modeling targeted conversational skills and (b) 5-min social interactions. A multiple baseline design across behaviors was used to evaluate the intervention and an increase in 2 out of 3 targeted conversation skills occurred. In addition, generalized behavior changes were observed. These findings provide support for including Social Stories as part of a video treatment package in teaching complex social interaction behaviors to young children with Asperger's Disorder.
17546489		Estimating the burden of disease for autism spectrum disorders in Spain in 2003.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Elena Sánchez-Valle, Manuel Posada, Ana Villaverde-Hueso, Eva Touriño, María José Ferrari-Arroyo, Leticia Boada, María Concepción Martín-Arribas, Ricardo Canal, Joaquín Fuentes-Biggi		Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are lifelong neurodevelopmental disabilities. Burden of Disease is an indicator that provides important information on health status and outcomes such as premature mortality and disability. In order to estimate the burden of disease of ASD in the Spanish population during 2003, we followed the procedures used in the WHO Global Burden of Disease Study. ASD generated 43,928 Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) in Spain in 2003, from which 33,797 were attributable to Autistic Disorder and 10,131 were caused by Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified. DALY could be a useful tool for health policy makers for setting health service priorities, allocating available resources effectively and providing a comparable measure of output for early intervention.
17543905		Language disorders: autism and other pervasive developmental disorders.	Pediatric clinics of North America	2007	Helen Tager-Flusberg, Elizabeth Caronna		This article summarizes current knowledge about language and communication impairments in children who have autism spectrum disorders. It reviews the language profiles that may be observed during the toddler and preschool years and in school-aged children and discusses receptive and expressive language skills that may be quite variable across the spectrum and the universal impairments in pragmatic aspects of language that are among the defining characteristics of the disorder. It concludes with clinical recommendations for pediatric screening of autism spectrum disorders and for continued monitoring of language difficulties in older children for whom interventions may be critical for enhancing effective communication in everyday life.
17520691		Decomposing the autism phenotype into familial dimensions.	American journal of medical genetics. Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics	2008	Peter Szatmari, Chantal Mérette, Claudia Emond, Lonnie Zwaigenbaum, Marshall B Jones, Michel Maziade, Marc-Andre Roy, Roberta Palmour		The objective of this article is to decompose the level of functioning phenotype in autism to see if it can be conceptualized as two simpler, but still familial, dimensional phenotypes of language and non-verbal IQ. We assembled 80 sibpairs with either autism, Asperger syndrome or atypical autism. To see whether the familial correlation on language scores was accounted for by the familial correlation on non-verbal IQ, residual language scores were calculated for each member of the sibpair based on a multiple regression equation using their IQ score as an explanatory or independent variable and controlling for the age and gender of the affected individual. These residual scores were then used to calculate intraclass correlations between affected sibs. This process was repeated using IQ as the dependent variable and language as a covariate. Within affected individuals there was a strong relation between non-verbal IQ (as measured by the Leiter performance scale) and language (as measured by the Vineland Communication Scale). In addition, there was familial correlation between sibs on both measures. Evidence of familial aggregation on both non-verbal IQ and language remained even after partialling out the effect of the covariates by regression analysis and by generalized estimating equation. These findings suggest that non-verbal IQ and language in PDD may arise from independent genetic mechanisms. The implications of this finding for linkage analysis and for identifying genetically informative phenotypes are discussed.

The basis for this association is poorly understood. How early language is related to each of the triad of impairments characteristic of ASDs is also in need of clarification.
17507202		Patients with a sodium channel alpha 1 gene mutation show wide phenotypic variation.	Epilepsy research	2007	Hitoshi Osaka, Ikuo Ogiwara, Emi Mazaki, Nami Okamura, Sumimasa Yamashita, Mizue Iai, Michiko Yamada, Kenji Kurosawa, Hiroko Iwamoto, Norio Yasui-Furukori, Sunao Kaneko, Tateki Fujiwara, Yushi Inoue, Kazuhiro Yamakawa		We investigated the roles of mutations in voltage-gated sodium channel alpha 1 subunit gene (SCN1A) in epilepsies and psychiatric disorders. The SCN1A gene was screened for mutations in three unrelated Japanese families with generalized epilepsy with febrile seizure plus (GEFS+), febrile seizure with myoclonic seizures, or intractable childhood epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (ICEGTC). In the family with GEFS+, one individual was affected with panic disorder and seizures, and another individual was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and seizures. The novel mutation V1366I was found in all probands and patients with psychiatric disorders of the three families. These results suggest that SCN1A mutations may confer susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in addition to variable epileptic seizures. Unidentified modifiers may play critical roles in determining the ultimate phenotype of patients with sodium channel mutations.

17478580		Lack of evidence for increased genetic loading for autism among families of affected females: a replication from family history data in two large samples.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007			Both the broad and narrow phenotypes of autism have been consistently observed in family members of affected individuals. Additionally, autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) present four times more often in males than in females, for reasons that are currently unknown. In this study, we examined whether there were differences in familial loading of ASD among families of male versus female probands. Analyses were conducted with existing data from two distinct samples. The first sample contained 417 individuals with autism and Asperger's disorder and included information on the ASD diagnoses of their first- and second-degree relatives. The second sample consisted of 405 sibships participating in the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange, of which one or more siblings had an ASD diagnosis. Results from both samples did not suggest significant differences in the prevalence of ASD among relatives of affected males versus females.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Jill Boucher	Department of Psychology, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK. j.boucher@warwick.ac.uk	JS is a highly able person with Asperger syndrome whose language and intellectual abilities are, and always have been, superior. The first part of this short article consists of JS's analytical account of his atypical memory abilities, and the strategies he uses for memorizing and learning. JS has also described specific difficulties with creative writing, which are outlined here. The second part of the article consists of an interpretation of the problems JS describes in terms of their implications for understanding the problems of generativity that contribute to the diagnostic impairments of imagination and creativity in autism.

17466072		Impairment of quality of life in parents of children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorder.	Health and quality of life outcomes	2007	Diego Mugno, Liliana Ruta, Valentina Genitori D'Arrigo, Luigi Mazzone		Little is known about the Quality of Life (QOL) in parents of children with developmental diseases as compared to other severe neurological or psychiatric disorders. Aims of the present study were: to evaluate QOL in parents of children affected by Pervasive Development Disorder (PDDs), Cerebral Palsy (CP) or Mental Retardation (MR) as compared to a control group (CG); to evaluate QOL of parents of patients with different types of PDDs, namely Autistic Disorder (AD), High Function Autism/Asperger Syndromes (HFA/AS) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PPD-NOS); and to compare the level of impairment in QOL of mothers and fathers within PDDs, CP, MR groups and between AD, HFA/AS, PDD-NOS sub-groups.
17453867		Linguistic characteristics of individuals with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome.	Clinical linguistics & phonetics	2007	Hye Kyeung Seung	Department of Human Communication Studies, California State University-Fullerton, CA 92834, USA. hseung@exchange.fullerton.edu	This study examined the linguistic characteristics of high functioning individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome. Each group consisted of 10 participants who were matched on sex, chronological age, and intelligence scores. Participants generated a narrative after watching a brief video segment of the Social Attribution Task video. Each participant was then asked 10 questions related to the stimulus video. The narrative samples and responses to the questions were analysed linguistically. Individuals with high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome performed similarly on most measures of language function; however, results suggest there may be pragmatically-based differences between the groups in the use of verb tense markers.

17447462		"[Autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) Japanese children's version "" comparison between high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders and normal controls]."	Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology	2007	Akio Wakabayashi, Tokio Uchiyama, Yoshikuni Tojo, Yuko Yoshida, Miho Kuroda, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright		The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) children's version has confirmed reliability and validity in the UK. In the current study, the children's AQ was administered in Japan to investigate whether the UK results are found in a very different culture. Two groups of children from primary and secondary schools were assessed: Group 1 (n = 81) children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD, including Asperger Syndrome and high-functioning autism); Group 2 (n = 372) randomly selected controls, age-matched with Group 1. The children with ASD had a mean AQ score of 31.9 (SD = 6.69), which was significantly higher than controls (mean AQ = 11.7, SD = 5.94). Males scored significantly higher than females in the control group, but not in the ASD group. The pattern of difference between the Japanese clinical group and the control group was remarkably similar to the findings in the UK.
17440803		Subjective organisation in the free recall learning of adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Dermot M Bowler, Sebastian B Gaigg, John M Gardiner		Single trial methods reveal unimpaired free recall of unrelated words in Asperger's syndrome (AS). When repeated trials are used (free recall learning), typical individuals show improved recall over trials, subjective organisation of material (SO) and a correlation between free recall and SO. We tested oral (Experiment 1) and written (Experiment 2) free recall over 16 trials in adults with AS and typical individuals. Across both experiments AS participants showed marginally diminished recall. Poorer SO was seen in the Asperger group only in Experiment 2, but in both experiments, individual differences in SO in the Asperger group were less likely to converge over trials. This lack of convergence suggests that the AS group organise material in idiosyncratic ways.
17440802		Defining the behavioral phenotype of Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Mohammad Ghaziuddin	Division of Child Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0277, USA. mghaziud@umich.edu	Asperger syndrome (AS) is characterized by social deficits and restricted interests in the absence of mental retardation and language delay. However, it is unclear to what extent the social deficits of AS differ from those of traditional autism. To address this issue, 58 subjects with AS were compared with 39 subjects with autism. Social deficits were classified according to Wing and Gould's method. Forty-six (79%) subjects with AS were rated as active but odd, while 32 (82%) with autism were described as aloof and passive, while a few subjects showed mixed features. Thus, despite the overlap between AS and autism, subjects with AS showed a distinct pattern of social impairment. Implications of these findings are discussed.
17438346		Errorless compliance training: success-focused behavioral treatment of children with Asperger syndrome.	Behavior modification	2007	Joseph M Ducharme, Elena Sanjuan, Tammy Drain		Errorless compliance training is a noncoercive, success-focused approach to treatment of problem behavior in children. The intervention involves graduated exposure of a child to increasingly more challenging requests at a slow enough rate to ensure that noncompliance rarely occurs, providing parents with many opportunities to reinforce cooperative responses and rendering punishment unnecessary. The authors evaluated this approach with three boys with characteristics of Asperger syndrome. Mothers first delivered a range of requests to their children and recorded child responses. For each child, the authors calculated compliance probability for all requests and categorized them into four probability levels, from those yielding high compliance (Level 1) to those that commonly led to opposition (Level 4). Treatment began with delivery of Level 1 requests. Requests from Levels 2 through 4 were faded in sequentially over several weeks. All three children demonstrated substantial generalized improvement in compliance.
17435568		Catatonia in autistic twins: role of electroconvulsive therapy.	The journal of ECT	2007	Samuel H Bailine, Sonata Petraviciute		Autism and Asperger disorder are pervasive developmental disorders that impair social interactions and communications. They are characterized by repetitive and stereotyped behaviors. Catatonia, a syndrome which is most often associated with schizophrenia and affective disorders, is seen in up to 6% of patients with autistic spectrum disorders and in 12% to 17% of adolescents with these disorders. Catatonic symptoms in these cases have been responsive to treatment with electroconvulsive therapy. We report a case of adolescent identical twins with PDD/Asperger disorder who exhibited catatonia and were successfully treated with electroconvulsive therapy.
17432198		[Biological significance of Broca's region].	Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology	2006	Nobuyuki Nishitani	Fujita Neurolagical Clinic	Since P. Broca (France) reported in 1960's the case with disturbance of speech caused by the left infero-posterior frontal lesion, this region was considered to be a kineticism speech center (Broca's area: BA). Linguistic functions have been clarified afterwards by many studies and case reports. Doubt whether the former BA where Homo Sapiens got a linguistic functions would take any kind of function is left as expected. We have faced an original function of BA based on results provided accidentally in our studies related to sensori-motor linkage mechanisms. Then, we have clarified brain function about non-linguistic processing. BA and the primary motor area (M1) were activated approximately at the same level, when a subject observed and performed the same actions by herself as ones of another person. In case that she imitated actions of another person, activities of BA and M1 increased significantly (Human Mirror Neuron System: HMNS). Subjects with Asperger's syndrome are impaired in social interaction and imitation of action showed abnormal processing of HMNS in BA and M1 which could account for a part of imitation and social impairments. These results converge on a central role of Broca's area as an orchestrator of time sensitive perceptual and motor functions underlying and non-verbally social communication.
17410426		A comparison of repetitive behaviors in Aspergers Disorder and high functioning autism.	Child psychiatry and human development	2007	Michael L Cuccaro, Laura Nations, Jason Brinkley, Ruth K Abramson, Harry H Wright, Alicia Hall, John Gilbert, Margaret A Pericak-Vance		In this study we compared 33 IQ and age matched pairs of individuals with Aspergers Disorder (ASP) and high functioning autism (HFA) on measures of repetitive behavior. On the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), the ASP and HFA groups showed no differences in RBS-R Intensity score (severity) score or Frequency score (number of problems present). This suggests that the two groups are similar with respect to the intensity or severity of repetitive behaviors and the presence of repetitive behaviors. At the item level there were no differences on scales typically associated with autism (Stereotyped Behavior) and ASP (Restricted Interests). Similarly, there were no differences between the groups on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Stereotypy scale. These findings add to the body of literature showing that HFA and ASP fail to differ with respect to repetitive behaviors. The implications of the findings for neurobiologic and genetic studies are discussed.
17406973		Parent-assisted friendship training for children with autism spectrum disorders: effects of psychotropic medication.	Child psychiatry and human development	2007	Fred Frankel, Robert Myatt, David Feinberg		Twenty-five 6 to 13-year-old children with autism spectrum disorders, who were high functioning, were given 12 weeks of parent-assisted children's friendship training. Thirteen were prescribed various psychotropic medications by physicians in the community prior to treatment (medicated) while 12 were not (unmedicated). Two parent-rated and three teacher-rated social measures served as outcome variables. Results revealed that unmedicated subjects had greater positive change on three of these five measures when compared to children in the medicated group. It was hypothesized that being prescribed psychotropic medication was a marker for refractory psychosocial treatment response by children with autism spectrum disorders.
17405073		[Asperger syndrome - a too late diagnosed disorder?].	Klinische Padiatrie	2007	C Schiffer, G Ristow, K Becker, M H Schmidt		Asperger syndrome is a disorder within the autistic spectrum, which was first described by Hans Asperger in 1944. It belongs to the group of pervasive developmental disorders and is particularly characterized by qualitative impairments of social interaction and communication as well as distinct special interests and stereotyped patterns of behaviour. We present a patient, showing the typical behavioural symptoms of the Asperger syndrome, which were first diagnosed at the age of sixteen.

The biological basis of this is unknown, but most likely includes impaired processing of facial emotion. Human social communication involves processing different facial emotions, and at different intensities. However nobody has examined brain function in people with AS when implicitly (unconsciously) processing four primary emotions at varying emotional intensities.
17390711		[Regional cerebral blood flow changes of right parietal lobe and superior temporal gyrus in Asperger's disorder in comparison with the patients with schizophrenia].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2007			Single-photon emission computed tomography (SEPCT) and neuropsychological tests were performed in subjects with Asperger's disorder and schizophrenia with a statistical parametric mapping analysis of 99mECD-SPECT images. The SPM analysis of SPECT images demonstrated reduced regional cerebral blood flows in right parietal lobe and right superior temporal gyrus in Asperger's disorder. On the other hand, schizophrenic individuals showed mild hypoperfusions in bilateral frontal lobes. These abnormalities on SEPCT images in Asperser's disorder could be related to the cognitive dysfunction observed in the spatial working memory task and the impairment of gaze processing. The SEPCT study could be helpful to discriminate Asperser's disorder from schizophrenia.
17389126		Autism and cytogenetic abnormalities: solving autism one chromosome at a time.	Current psychiatry reports	2007	Christa Lese Martin, David H Ledbetter		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interactions, communication, and behavior. Multiple lines of evidence support the notion that most cases of autism likely have an underlying genetic cause or predisposition. Like mental retardation, autism is likely to be caused by many different genetic mechanisms and genes rather than a single, or few, major genes or environmental effects. In this review, we will focus on the cytogenetic contribution to uncovering regions of the genome involved in autism. Some common cytogenetic imbalances already known to cause autism will be highlighted. Routine genetic testing in clinical (CLIA-certified) diagnostic laboratories can identify the specific etiology and recurrence risk in 10% to 15% of autism cases and is clinically indicated for any child with autism. Powerful new methods for identifying novel regions of the genome causing or contributing to autism also will be discussed and will start to explain the etiology for some percentage of the remaining 85% to 90% of autism cases.

17372817		Access to care for autism-related services.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Kathleen C Thomas, Alan R Ellis, Carolyn McLaurin, Julie Daniels, Joseph P Morrissey		This paper identifies family characteristics associated with use of autism-related services. A telephone or in-person survey was completed during 2003-2005 by 383 North Carolina families with a child 11 years old or younger with ASD. Access to care is limited for racial and ethnic minority families, with low parental education, living in nonmetropolitan areas, and not following a major treatment approach. Service use is more likely when parents have higher stress. Families use a broad array of services; the mix varies with child ASD diagnosis and age group. Disparities in service use associated with race, residence and education point to the need to develop policy, practice and family-level interventions that can address barriers to services for children with ASD.

17365252		Cognitive and executive functions in anorexia nervosa ten years after onset of eating disorder.	Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology	2007	I Carina Gillberg, Maria Råstam, Elisabet Wentz, Christopher Gillberg		In a longitudinal study, the authors explore the course of general cognition in anorexia nervosa (AN) over time and compare general cognitive problems, executive function deficits, attentional problems and visuomotor dysfunctions across AN individuals and healthy controls. A community-based sample of adolescent onset AN cases (n=40-47) was contrasted with an age-, sex- and school matched comparison group (n=47-51) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and Luria word recall test at a mean age of 24 years. Only two of the cases tested were underweight at the time of the study. The Wechsler scale had also been administered when the groups had a mean age of 21 years. There were few differences across the two groups even though the comparison group performed significantly better on the Object Assembly subtest of the WAIS-R. IQ increased slightly but significantly over time in both groups. There was no relationship between level of starvation and poor results on tests in the AN group. A subgroup of the subjects had autism spectrum disorders. In this subgroup there were cases with test profiles similar to those observed in autism and Asperger syndrome, just as there had been on testing three years previously. Ten years after AN onset, the former AN cases showed no major neuropsychological deficits. A subgroup with autistic features had test profiles similar to those observed in autism spectrum disorders. The AN group as a whole showed poor results on the object assembly subtest indicating weak central coherence with a tendency to focus on details at the expense of configural information. This cognitive style may account for their obsession with details, with implications for psychoeducational approaches in treatment programmes/interventions.

We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on the genomic DNA of patients and unaffected subjects to detect copy number variants not present in their respective parents. Candidate genomic regions were validated by higher-resolution CGH, paternity testing, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and microsatellite genotyping. Confirmed de novo CNVs were significantly associated with autism (P = 0.0005). Such CNVs were identified in 12 out of 118 (10%) of patients with sporadic autism, in 2 out of 77 (3%) of patients with an affected first-degree relative, and in 2 out of 196 (1%) of controls. Most de novo CNVs were smaller than microscopic resolution. Affected genomic regions were highly heterogeneous and included mutations of single genes. These findings establish de novo germline mutation as a more significant risk factor for ASD than previously recognized.

17354573		[Asperger syndrome in adolescence: The problem and appropriate treatment].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Keizo Nagao	National Hospital Organization Sakakibara Hospital	I have described the corresponding method for bullying, independence and interpersonal relationships of company/opposite sex, thinking disorders caused by suffering damage or victimization and withdrawal and violence in the family among the problems in and in response to Asperger syndrome in adolescent cases. Psychotherapy is used for bullying and interpersonal relationship problems. Cognitive therapy and protective correspondence are more effective in bullying than the exposure method. It seems to be more effective to teach and instruct the corresponding principle as well as supportive response because interpersonal relationships are likely to involve failures. Pharmacological therapy was valid in feelings of paranoia and violence. Since the disorder has been recently conceptualized in pervasive developmental disorder, the scope of the subject has increased whereas Asperger syndrome used to be diagnosed in compliance with its classic examples. Therefore, it needs to clarify diagnostic examples based on new concepts, accumulate subject examples and verify the corresponding method with evidence.
17354572		[Care and social treatment for parent(s) and children with Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Yasuo Tanaka	Graduate School of Education, Hokkaido University.	This paper describes the care and social treatment for parent(s) and child with Asperger syndrome. The children with Asperger syndrome are not easily distinguished from children without Asperger syndrome. The diagnosis can be varied depending on perspectives. They are more likely to receive inappropriate intervention due to lack of understanding. They are more likely to develop emotional and conduct problems secondarily. Because their disorders cannot be seen clearly, their difficulties are not identified. It seems that parent(s) and child with Asperger syndrome are hurt by this problem. It is difficult to operate parents' association and self-help group. They should learn it about one's diagnosis. While having a difference, an effort to live together is demanded.

From the viewpoint of individualized support and class-wide management, means of some effective educational support in regular education classroom was introduced. In the practice of individualized support, importance of the case meeting where teachers and parents participated in was pointed out. In addition, it was necessary to make support tools to realize effective support. On the other hand, in the practice of class-wide management, guidance of making human relations between children was one of the top priority problems.
17354570		[Pharmacologic treatment of Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Satoru Yamada	Tokyo Metropolitan Umegaoka Hospital.	Asperger syndrome is associated with various dysfunctional and problematic behaviors, in addition to the core features of communication and social skills dysfunction that define these conditions. Although there is currently no pharmacologic cure for the core features of Asperger syndrome. This article discusses the various medications for the behavioral symptoms of Asperger syndrome, which include hyperactivity, aggression, tantrums, self-injury, depression, obsession and so on. Methylphenidate, SSRIs, atypical antipsychotics and mood stabilizer were introduced.
17354569		[Behavior analytic approach to Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Shigeru Haramaki, Andy Bondy		We describe the behavior analytic approach to helping people with Asperger syndrome regarding social interaction and communication issues. In the behavior analytic approach, the cause of maladaptive behavior is not attributed to the disability itself. Maladaptive behaviors are viewed as a function of the interaction between an individual and the environment. Therefore, we assess these functional relationships and intervene by modifying aspects of the environment. Functional assessment is one of the most effective methods to evaluate the cause of problem behaviors and helps in the selection of an intervention strategy. We teach students functionally equivalent alternative behaviors that are socially appropriate and yet met the needs of the individual. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of teaching individuals with Asperger syndrome critical skills, including communication skills, self-management skills, and how to deal with anxiety.
17354567		[Similarities and differences between the behavior of Asperger's syndrome and obsessive-compulsive disorder].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Ohiko Hashimoto	Department of Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Nursing and Rehabilitation, Aino University.	Asperger's syndrome (AS) is one of subcategories of pervasive developmental disorder defined by behavioral symptoms. These symptoms include repetitive and stereotyped patterns similar to the behavior of obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD). These are included by a broader concept newly named as obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. While there may be biological bases common to the repetitive behaviors of PDD and OCD, differential diagnosis is important from the clinical point of view. Most of the obsession-like and compulsion-like behaviors of the former lack ego-dystonic features. Moreover, AS has no clinically significant delay in language in definition, but has pragmatic disorder, which should not be seen in OCD.
17354566		[Personality disorder].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Yoshiro Okajima	Department of Psychiatry, Jichi Medical School.	Differentiating between diagnoses of Asperger's syndrome and personality disorders is difficult because of the symptomatology of these disorders and due to the following methodological problems: 1) Developmental disorders, including Asperger's syndrome, are diagnosed in consideration of the time course, while personality disorders are cross sectional entities: 2) The distinction between both becomes more difficult according to the specific operational diagnosis system used. 3) Differentiating between these diagnoses is difficult because data regarding the developmental problems of adult patients with Asperger's syndrome are rare. In consideration of such problems, differential diagnoses between Asperger's syndrome and some types of personality disorder, namely schizoid, schizotypal, borderline, anankastic and avoidant types are discussed. Furthermore, the antisocial tendencies of Asperger's syndrome are also discussed.
17354565		[Differential diagnosis between pervasive developmental disorder and schizophrenia].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Takashi Ishii	Department of Psychiatry for Parents and Children, Nagoya University Hospital.	Differential diagnosis between schizophrenia and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) including Asperger's syndrome, needs evaluation of apparently similar symptoms among the two disorders and careful collection of information about developmental history of each patient. Some conditions that have been traditionally regarded as schizophrenia, seem to have overlapping parts with those of PDD. An example of them is schizophrenia--like symptoms observed occasionally in individuals with PDD. The relationship of the two disorders remains to be investigated. I present a case of an adolescent with early symptoms of schizophrenia, in whom there seems to have been PDD symptoms in his early childhood. The issue of the differential diagnosis of the two disorders is discussed on the basis of the case. It is sometimes difficult to diagnose PDD in mildest cases in adolescence or adulthood, presumably because they show subtle symptoms in their early childhood in terms of interpersonal relationships and caretakers of them are likely to fail to recognize their problems, which may cause difficulty in sufficient collection of information about their early childhood.
17354564		[Non-verbal learning disabilities].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Yoichi Sakakihara	Research Center for Child and Adolescent Development and Education, Ochanomizu University.	In 1975, Myklebust proposed a special form of learning disabilities characterizes by impairment of spatial cognition, social interaction and conceptualization, and named it as non-verbal learning disabilities (NLD). Since the brain locus for spatial cognition was thought to be localized in the right hemisphere, NLD was regarded as a disorder of the right hemispheric function. The clinical characteristics of NLD are almost identical to those of Asperger syndrome (AS), which was introduced in English literature in 1981. Since Asperger syndrome is regarded as one of the autistic spectrum disorders, and autism was once regarded as the left hemispheric dysfunction, it has long been believed that NLD and AS are clinically different entities. However, their clinical similarities have raised a growing opinion that these two disorders are probably identical or at least closely related.
17354563		[Differentiation between childhood autism and Asperger's syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Katsunaka Mikami, Hideo Matsumoto		According to the DSM-IV, the autism diagnosis always has priority over the Asperger syndrome (AS). If a patient meets the criteria for autism, the diagnosis of AS is ruled out. However, since Lona Wing reexamined Asperger's original description and noted the similarities between autism and AS, whether autism, especially high-functioning autism (HFA), and AS were the same disorder or not has been controversial. There is no reason why we distinguish HFA from AS with regard to general intervention and social and communication skill training. From a view point of clinical features, cognitive neurophychology and neurobiology, the differentiation between HFA and AS is not clear. There are few reports on outcome in HFA and AS. Whereas, it is suggested that HFA and AS may be different in social problems such as suicide attempt. Researches on the differentiation between HFA and AS are to be needed in future.

Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Shuhei Suzuki	Department of Developmental Brain Science, Osaka Medical College.	I discussed, in this chapter, the possibilities and limitations of clinical diagnosis for Asperger syndrome (AS) in infancy and early childhood. For early diagnosis or simply noticing the possibility of AS, clinicians should be sensitive to the auxiliary conditions of AS such as motor dysfunction and sensory/sleep disturbances during the early stage of life, as well as the incipient representations of the main AS symptoms in the diagnostic criteria, such as lack of reciprocal social interaction or joint attention. Future prospective study with large cohort, or creation of the new methods for cognitive evaluation which is applicable to infants and toddlers, would be profitable in order to establish the sensitive tool for AS diagnosis in early infancy, while the idea would be expected undoubtedly elusive.
17354561		[Early detection of and diagnostic tools for Asperger's disorder].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Yoko Kamio	National Institute of Mental Health, National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry.	Case identification of children with high-functioning pervasive developmental disorders (HFPDD) including Asperger's disorder tends to be delayed. A delay of case identification prevent from access to early intervention for children and parents. Although early diagnosis of HFPDD is difficult and less sensitive at present, several objective evaluation scales, such as CARS, ADOS-G and ADI-R, can be applied to very young children and are found to be relatively sensitive and stable. Recently autism-specific screening tools, such as the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT), the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), have been developed. The current research using the Japanese version of the M-CHAT and its clinical use combined with the infant health check-up system are described.
17354560		[Diagnostic criteria for Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Kyoko Tanaka, Tokio Uchiyama		The diagnostic criteria for Asperger syndrome (AS) are still controversial. ICD-10 and DSM-IV are usually used as a formal diagnostic criteria for AS. However, many papers point out there are many problems in ICD-10/DSM-IV. It is indicated that the diagnosis of AS using ICD-10/DSM-IV criteria is virtually impossible due to the rule of onset and precedence. ICD-10/DSM-IV criteria don't include core symptoms of AS, such as odd speech and limited intelligent interests reported by Hans Asperger. Most of the cases which are diagnosed as AS clinically meet the diagnostic criteria for autism or atypical autism(PDD-NOS) in ICD-10/DSM-IV. ICD-10/DSM-IV criteria is too narrow to diagnose AS. This causes much confusion and disadvantage for families, clinicians and researchers. We need to establish the clinically useful and reliable diagnostic criteria for AS.
17354559		[Psychiatric comorbidities and secondary emotional difficulties in Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Toru Yoshikawa	Aichi Prefectural Colony Central Hospital.	"People with developmental disorders frequently have psychiatric comorbidities and problematic emotional reactions and behaviors. We commonly calls these conditions ""nizi-shougai (secondary difficulties)"" in Japan. But there is no clear definition of ""nizi-shougai"", and it is impossible to distinguish ""secondary difficulties"" from the problems derived from Asperger syndrome itself. In this paper, I focus on psychiatric comorbidities and emotional difficulties of Asperger syndrome. Early detection and intervention for children with developmental disorders can prevent some kind of ""secondary difficulties"". Treatment for Asperger syndrome should be tailored to meet individual characteristics and needs."
17354558		[Pragmatic impairments in individuals with Asperger syndrome: characteristics and interventions].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Manabu Oi	Faculty of Education, Kanazawa University.	Researches on pragmatic impairments in individuals with Asperger syndrome were reviewed in regard to its characteristics and interventions. The very wide diversity of their pragmatic impairments was studied in terms of speech acts, expressing mental states, comprehension of indirect speech, question and answer, conversational turn-taking, narratives, pronouns and addressing forms, inferential language, reference and cohesion, and humor and joke. As for theories on background of the impairments, theory of mind and relevance, central coherence, executive function, general semiotic deficit, and others were discussed. Then, intervention techniques were outlined. Those were social stories, social skills training, teaching theory of mind, individual and group interventions from socio-pragmatic viewpoint.
17354557		[Impairment of social interaction, coordination disorder, and hypersensitivity in Asperger's syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Tomoko Asai, Toshiro Sugiyam		Asperger's syndrome is not accompanied with intellectual disability, however it has social impairments as well as autism and demonstrates failure to develop peer relationships according to each life stage. Social reciprocal behavior deficits are revealed typically during childhood. On the other hand, after school age these deficits are modified by environmental factors that may induce secondary disorders consequently. Hypersensitivity and coordination disorder, which are not included in diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome, are often in presence. These symptoms are diminished and rarely interfere daily living as growth. However they may keep Asperger's syndrome individuals from adapting to others, so we need to take it into consideration.
17354556		[Advances in neuroimaging research on Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Genichi Sugihara, Yasuomi Ouchi, Kazuhiko Nakamura, Yoshimoto Sekine, Norio Mori		Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (i.e., autism and Asperger syndrome) is a neurodevelopmental disorder, although its etiology is still unclear. Neuroimaging studies have attempted to identify the neurobiological basis of ASD. This article reviews recent progress in ASD research using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET). MRI studies documented structural and functional abnormalities in cerebella, the frontal lobes, the temporal lobes, and limbic systems of individuals with ASD. SPECT and PET studies suggested that abnormalities of the serotonergic system, in addition to decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the frontal and temporal lobes, are implicated in the pathophysiology of ASD.
17354555		[Genetic factors in Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Tsukasa Sasaki	Health Service Center, University of Tokyo.	"Asperger syndrome (or Aperger's disorder) is one of the syndromes of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (or pervasive developmental disorder). Twin and family studies have indicated that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of ASD, including ""classical"" autism, in a complicated fashion of inheritance. The role may be more significant than in other major psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide linkage studies and cytogenetic studies suggest several chromosomal regions, including 2q, 7q and 15q, for linkage with autism and ASD. While the 7q region is considered the most promising in autism, linkage studies in Asperger syndrome have failed to observe its linkage to this region. Whether the genetic studies should be conducted separately in Asperger syndrome or in the entire ASD might be an issue of discussion for future studies."
17354554		[Environmental factors in Asperger syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Takaaki Abe, Satoshi Kato		This paper reviews what is currently known about the environmental factors in Asperger syndrome that is a neurodevelopmental disorder of genetic origins. Its characteristics tend to occur in families of those with the syndrome. The rate of complications during pregnancy or the neonatal period in the patients with Asperger syndrome was about the same as that in the control group. It is true that their involvement in their outer world could not influence the core social deficits very much. But it might facilitate the appearance of the second symptoms such as dissociation, anxiety, depression, persecutory delusion as well as antisocial behavior including serious criminal acts.
17354553		[Neurological background of Asperger's disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Motomi Toichi	Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences.	The core features of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) are impairment in social interaction and restricted ranges of interest and activities with obsessive/compulsive traits. Clinical characteristics of PDD range across a variety of psychophysiological areas, from vigilance and autonomic arousal through attention to higher cognitive functions such as memory and language. The author reviewed hypotheses on the neurological background of PDD, which includes brainstem, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, mirror neuron system, and amygdala and related circuit. Among them, the amygdala hypothesis appears to be most successful in explaining the core feature of PDD, i.e. social impairment. It is expected that advance in cognitive neuroscience on social behavior will clarify the link between neurological and clinical findings of Asperger's disorder.
17354552		[Asperger's syndrome and medical care].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Hironobu Ichikawa	Tokyo Metropolitan Umegaoka Hospital.	"Asperger's syndrome has been recognized recently. Diagnosis is done by DSM-IV-TR, ICD-10 or Autistic Spectrum Diagnosis. Medical care is performed by adjustment of environmental atmosphere, educational treatment and/or medication. Patients are cured by parents or teachers who can understand their thinking or behavior pattern. Educational treatment is important to compensate the lack of ""mind of theory"", of integration of central nervous system and of executive functioning. Medication is applied only secondary symptoms, such as hallucinated or delusional complaints or change of mood or compulsive behavior. Some of this syndrome's patients have excellent abilities and will accomplish great achievement in adult. We need protect them from bullying or secondary social withdrawal in adolescent age."
17354551		[Epidemiology of Asperger's syndrome].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Yukiko Suzuki, Kazuhiko Saito		Only a little data is available so far on the prevalence of Asperger's syndrome. The prevalence that Fombonne (2003) estimated after considering six European research was 2/10,000. In Ishikawa's study (2006) conducted in Nagoya city, Japan, the prevalence of Asperger's syndrome was 56/10,000. Currently there are not strict diagnostic criteria of Asperger's syndrome and methods of investigation are not consistent in each study. Therefore the prevalence rate for Asperger's syndrome covered very wide range. Although we still don't have a precise prevalence data on Asperger's syndrome, the awareness of this syndrome emerged in these several decades tells us that further research and support for the children of Asperger's syndrome and their family are necessary.

Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Gen Ishikawa, Kayo Ichihashi		"Bosch (1970) was the first author who used ""Asperger's syndrome"" in English literature. In those days, ""Kanner's syndrome"" i.e. autism, which had been under schizophrenic-versus-undeveloped arguments from the 1960's, was always contrasted with Asperger's ""autistic psychopathy in children"". From then on there have been vicissitudes over the notion of ""Asperger's syndrome"" and its clinical presentation. Nowadays, the restricted notion of ""Asperger's syndrome"" is dominant and used in both DSM-IV-TR and ICD-10. However, debates concerning the aspect of Asperger s ""psychopathy"" in clinical study and practice have long disappeared. In daily life, when we describe someone as ""like Asperger's"", it means a personality deviation that is to the degree of Asperger's ""psychopathy"". The history of Asperger's ""psychopathy"" is still developing in our culture."
17354549		[Asperger syndrome; the issue and the truth].	Nihon rinsho. Japanese journal of clinical medicine	2007	Toshiro Sugiyama	Aichi Children's Health and Medical Center.	In recent years, Asperger disorder became a key issue in Japan. Serious crimes which have been caused by high-functioning PDD adolescents have become a social problem. Total population study of PDD showed the increase of these children, and the most recent study reported the prevalence to be 2%, in Nagoya City. Now, we have at least one PDD in every school class. It poses a serious problem for Japanese school education. On the other hand, it had gradually become apparent that there are many PDD adult who had been misdiagnosed with other psychiatric disorders; schizophrenia, BPD and so on. The author discusses the relevant issue of Asperger disorder and high-functioning PDD from a clinical perspective.

17353217		The Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST): test-retest reliability in a high scoring sample.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Carrie Allison, Jo Williams, Fiona Scott, Carol Stott, Patrick Bolton, Simon Baron-Cohen, Carol Brayne		The Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST) is a 37-item parental self-completion questionnaire designed to screen for high-functioning autism spectrum conditions in epidemiological research. The CAST has previously demonstrated good accuracy for use as a screening test, with high sensitivity in studies with primary school aged children in mainstream schools. This study aimed to investigate test-retest reliability of the CAST in a high scoring sample. To this end, 73 parents filled in the second CAST (CAST-2) within approximately 2 months of the first administration of the CAST (CAST-1). Agreement above and below the cut-point of 15 was investigated. The kappa statistic for agreement (<15 versus > or =15) was 0.41. It was found that 70 percent (95% CI: 58, 80) of children did not move across the cut-point of 15. The correlation between the two test scores was 0.67 (Spearman's rho). The CAST shows moderate test-retest reliability in a high scoring sample, further evidence that it is a relatively robust screening tool for epidemiological research.
17353211		An autistic dimension: a proposed subtype of obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Susanne Bejerot	Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. Susanne.Bejerot@sll.se	This article focuses on the possibility that autism spectrum disorder (ASD: Asperger syndrome, autism and atypical autism) in its milder forms may be clinically important among a substantial proportion of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and discusses OCD subtypes based on this proposition. The hypothesis derives from extensive clinical experience of OCD and ASD, and literature searches on MEDLINE. Neuropsychological deficits are more common in OCD than in panic disorder and depression. Moreover, obsessive-compulsive and schizotypal personality disorders are over-represented in OCD. These may constitute mis-perceived clinical manifestations of ASD. Furthermore, repetitive behaviours and hoarding are common in Asperger syndrome. It is suggested that the comorbidity results in a more severe and treatment resistant form of OCD. OCD with comorbid ASD should be recognized as a valid OCD subtype, analogous to OCD with comorbid tics. An odd personality, with paranoid, schizotypal, avoidant or obsessive-compulsive traits, may indicate these autistic dimensions in OCD patients.

Revista de neurologia	2007	R Ayuda-Pascual, J Martos-Pérez		People with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism both have difficulties in the social area that become manifest in alterations affecting the development of mental skills, difficulties in self-perception and control over the emotions, and scant success when it comes to developing social interactions that last for any length of time.
17347946		[Asperger syndrome: diagnosis and treatment].	Revista de neurologia	2007	A Fernández-Jaén, D Martin Fernández-Mayoralas, B Calleja-Pérez, N Muñoz-Jareno		Asperger syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by social impairments, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviours. It is not associated with delay in language development as others pervasive developmental disorders. Diagnosis should be made based on a complete clinical history and psychological assessment; specific diagnostic instruments are useful.

Revista de neurologia	2007	M C Etchepareborda, A Díaz-Lucero, M J Pascuale, L Abad-Mas, R Ruiz-Andrés		Asperger's syndrome (AS) is characterised by its effects on reciprocal social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, difficulty in accepting changes, inflexible thinking and reduced fields of interest, but also by the presentation of special skills.
17345168		Narrative discourse in adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Livia Colle, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright, Heather K J van der Lely		We report a study comparing the narrative abilities of 12 adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger Syndrome (AS) versus 12 matched controls. The study focuses on the use of referential expressions (temporal expressions and anaphoric pronouns) during a story-telling task. The aim was to assess pragmatics skills in people with HFA/AS in whom linguistic impairments are more subtle than in classic autism. We predicted no significant differences in general narrative abilities between the two groups, but specific pragmatic deficits in people with AS. We predicted they use fewer personal pronouns, temporal expressions and referential expressions, which require theory of mind abilities. Results confirmed both predictions. These findings provide initial evidence of how social impairments can produce mild linguistic impairments.
17340201		Sleep in children with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	E Juulia Paavonen, Kimmo Vehkalahti, Raija Vanhala, Lennart von Wendt, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Eeva T Aronen		The prevalence of sleep disturbances in 52 children with Asperger syndrome (AS) as compared with 61 healthy controls (all subjects aged 5-17 years) was investigated. Problems with sleep onset and maintenance, sleep-related fears, negative attitudes toward sleeping, and daytime somnolence were more frequent among children with AS than among controls. Short sleep duration (<9 h) was almost twofold (59% vs. 32%), and the risk for sleep onset problems more than fivefold (53% vs. 10%) more common in the AS group than in the control group. Child-reported sleeping problems were also more prevalent in the AS group than in controls (58% vs. 7%). The results suggest that sleep disturbances should be routinely evaluated in children with AS.
17340200		Asperger syndrome and autism: a comparative longitudinal follow-up study more than 5 years after original diagnosis.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2008	Mats Cederlund, Bibbi Hagberg, Eva Billstedt, I Carina Gillberg, Christopher Gillberg		Prospective follow-up study of 70 males with Asperger syndrome (AS), and 70 males with autism more than 5 years after original diagnosis. Instruments used at follow-up included overall clinical assessment, the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders, Wechsler Intelligence Scales, Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, and Global Assessment of Functioning Scale. Specific outcome criteria were used. Outcome in AS was good in 27% of cases. However, 26% had a very restricted life, with no occupation/activity and no friends. Outcome in the autism group was significantly worse. Males with AS had worse outcomes than expected given normal to high IQ. However, outcome was considerably better than for the comparison group of individuals with autism.
17340170		Reaction time of facial affect recognition in Asperger's disorder for cartoon and real, static and moving faces.	Child psychiatry and human development	2007	Motohide Miyahara, Anne Bray, Masatsugu Tsujii, Chikako Fujita, Toshiro Sugiyama		This study used a choice reaction-time paradigm to test the perceived impairment of facial affect recognition in Asperger's disorder. Twenty teenagers with Asperger's disorder and 20 controls were compared with respect to the latency and accuracy of response to happy or disgusted facial expressions, presented in cartoon or real images and in static or moving conditions. Group analysis revealed that the Asperger group did not differ significantly from the control group in speed and accuracy for both affects and in all presentation modalities. Individual analysis, however, revealed that the proportion of participants exhibiting a happy face advantage was smaller in the Asperger group than in the control group. The results did not support the notion of impairment in facial affect recognition in terms of speed and accuracy in Asperger's disorder. Findings also revealed that the absence of happy face advantage was more prevalent in individuals with Asperger's disorder.
17321555		Differential fear conditioning in Asperger's syndrome: implications for an amygdala theory of autism.	Neuropsychologia	2007	Sebastian B Gaigg, Dermot M Bowler		Since the first descriptions of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), abnormalities in socio-emotional behaviours have been described as amongst the most characteristic clinical features of this condition. Current evidence in this area suggests that individuals with ASD experience difficulties in the perception and expression of emotions within the social domain. The causes for these emotional difficulties are, however, still poorly understood. At the developmental level, it is unclear whether emotional disturbances constitute a primary feature of the clinical presentation of ASD or whether they are secondary to abnormalities in other areas of cognition. At the neurobiological level, it is still debated to what extent abnormalities of the limbic system, in particular the amygdala, may be responsible for the emotional disturbances characterising ASD. Here we show that a group of individuals with Asperger's syndrome exhibit a pattern of abnormality in differentially acquiring fear, which suggests that their fear responses are atypically modulated by conditioned and non-conditioned stimuli. On the basis of these results and the existing literature we suggest that ASD may be characterised by atypicalities in the integration of physiological and cognitive aspects of emotional experiences which we argue arise because of poor connectivity between the amygdala and functionally associated cortical areas.

Electronic address: tcarlson@mednet.ucla.edu.	This case report describes two children who developed hyperammonemia together with frank manic behavior during treatment with a combination of valproic acid and risperidone. One child had been maintained on valproic acid for years and risperidone was added. In the second case, valproic acid was introduced to a child who had been treated with risperidone for years. In both cases, discontinuing the valproic acid resulted in normalization of ammonia levels and cessation of the manic behavior. This case report alerts physicians to the importance of obtaining serum ammonia levels in children treated with valproic acid and risperidone who present with manic behavior.
17312261		Affective computing and autism.	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2006	Rana el Kaliouby, Rosalind Picard, Simon Baron-Cohen		This article highlights the overlapping and converging goals and challenges of autism research and affective computing. We propose that a collaboration between autism research and affective computing could lead to several mutually beneficial outcomes--from developing new tools to assist people with autism in understanding and operating in the socioemotional world around them, to developing new computational models and theories that will enable technology to be modified to provide an overall better socioemotional experience to all people who use it. This article describes work toward this convergence at the MIT Media Lab, and anticipates new research that might arise from the interaction between research into autism, technology, and human socioemotional intelligence.
17300990		Effects of vagus nerve stimulation in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy and Asperger syndrome: case report and review of the literature.	Epilepsy & behavior : E&B	2007	Tanya C Warwick, James Griffith, Bernardo Reyes, Benalfew Legesse, Melanie Evans		Seizures are a common comorbidity of autism and occur in as many as 30% of patients. This case report describes a 23-year-old man diagnosed with both Asperger syndrome and bitemporal epilepsy. The patient had behavioral regression that correlated with worsening of his intractable seizures. He subsequently underwent implantation of a vagus nerve stimulation therapy device for his refractory epilepsy. Both his seizures and his behavior were monitored for 6 months. We describe the efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation therapy in reducing seizure severity as well as improving the behavioral components of his Asperger syndrome. We also review the current literature regarding epilepsy in autistic spectrum disorders.
17294982		Criminal responsibility in Asperger's syndrome.	The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences	2006	Nachum Katz, Zvi Zemishlany		Asperger's syndrome (AS) has been of much interest in the last two decades. Most people with AS are law abiding and are not involved in any violence. Over the years, however, there is increasing evidence of violent behavior and criminal acts committed by some people with AS. The characteristics of the link between AS and violation of the law requires identification and definition and the question regarding the criminal responsibility to be attributed to these offenders needs to be clarified.
17287716		Evaluation of a methodology for a collaborative multiple source surveillance network for autism spectrum disorders--Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 sites, United States, 2002.	Morbidity and mortality weekly report. Surveillance summaries (Washington, D.C. : 2002)	2007			Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) encompass a spectrum of conditions, including autistic disorder; pervasive developmental disorders, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS); and Asperger disorder. Impairments associated with ASDs can range from mild to severe. In 2000, in response to increasing public heath concern regarding ASDs, CDC established the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network. The primary objective of this ongoing surveillance system is to track the prevalence and characteristics of ASDs in the United States. ADDM data are useful to understand the prevalence of ASDs and have implications for improved identification, health and education service planning, and intervention for children with ASDs. Because complete, valid, timely, and representative prevalence estimates are essential to inform public health responses to ASDs, evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the ADDM methodology is needed to determine how well these methods meet the network's objective.

We present secondary analyses to better define the scope of effects of methylphenidate on symptoms that define attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), as well as the core autistic symptom domain of repetitive behavior.
17273936		Stalking, and social and romantic functioning among adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Mark Stokes, Naomi Newton, Archana Kaur		We examine the nature and predictors of social and romantic functioning in adolescents and adults with ASD. Parental reports were obtained for 25 ASD adolescents and adults (13-36 years), and 38 typical adolescents and adults (13-30 years). The ASD group relied less upon peers and friends for social (OR = 52.16, p < .01) and romantic learning (OR = 38.25, p < .01). Individuals with ASD were more likely to engage in inappropriate courting behaviours (chi2 df = 19 = 3168.74, p < .001) and were more likely to focus their attention upon celebrities, strangers, colleagues, and ex-partners (chi2 df = 5 =2335.40, p < .001), and to pursue their target longer than controls (t = -2.23, df = 18.79, p < .05). These results show that the diagnosis of ASD is pertinent when individuals are prosecuted under stalking legislation in various jurisdictions.
17273935		Brief report: impaired identification of discrepancies between expressive faces and voices in adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Kate O'Connor	Psychology Department, University of Auckland, Private Bag, 92109 Auckland, New Zealand. gamokatio@yahoo.co.nz	The aim of the present experiment was to examine the ability of adults with Asperger's syndrome and age-matched typically-developing controls to identify incongruent and congruent emotional information from the face and voice. In the first part of the experiment, participants determined whether simultaneously presented expressive faces and voices were the same or different. In the second part, participants identified expressive faces and voices in isolation. Results showed that relative to controls, adults with AS were less accurate at distinguishing between congruent and incongruent expressive faces and voices. Both groups obtained similar accuracy to expressive faces and voices presented in isolation. These findings may partially explain some of the difficulties individuals on the autistic spectrum have with social interaction.
17267061		Neurophysiological responses to face, facial regions and objects in adults with Asperger's syndrome: an ERP investigation.	International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology	2007	Kate O'Connor, Jeff P Hamm, Ian J Kirk		Face processing differences have been observed between AS and control subjects at the behavioural and neurological levels. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the neurophysiological basis of processing faces and facial features (eyes and mouths) in adults with AS relative to age- and gender-matched typically-developing controls. These results were compared with ERPs generated to objects in both groups to determine if any differences were specific to facial stimuli. Although both groups elicited earlier N170 latencies to faces than to face parts and to eyes relative to mouths, adults with AS exhibited delayed N170 latencies to faces and face parts relative to controls. This difference was not observed to objects. Together these findings suggest that adults with AS may be slower to process facial information.
19300548		Aripiprazole treatment of Asperger's syndrome in the acute psychiatric setting: case report.	Neuropsychiatric disease and treatment	2007	Luiz Dratcu, Gavin McKay, Vinod Singaravelu, Venkat Krishnamurthy		Asperger's syndrome (AS) is under-recognized and may be misdiagnosed as schizophrenia in adults because of symptom overlap. Pharmacological treatment usually targets associated behavioral and mental symptoms rather than the actual core features of AS. We report a middle-aged male patient who, after many years of previous contact with mental health services, and on account of his psychotic symptoms and diagnosis of schizophrenia, was admitted to an inner-city acute psychiatric unit, where a primary diagnosis of AS was established for the first time in his life. His impairing clinical features of AS improved markedly following treatment using aripiprazole, a novel atypical antipsychotic that acts as a partial agonist at dopamine D(2) receptors. As well as sharing clinical features, there is an overlap in underlying neurobiology of AS and schizophrenia, including dopamine dysfunction, that provides a rationale for using antipsychotics of this class in the clinical management not only of associated psychotic symptoms but also of the core features of AS itself.

Biological psychology	2007	T Kujala, E Aho, T Lepistö, E Jansson-Verkasalo, T Nieminen-von Wendt, L von Wendt, R Näätänen		Asperger syndrome, which belongs to the autistic spectrum of disorders, is characterized by deficits of social interaction and abnormal perception, like hypo- or hypersensitivity in reacting to sounds and discriminating certain sound features. We determined auditory feature discrimination in adults with Asperger syndrome with the mismatch negativity (MMN), a neural response which is an index of cortical change detection. We recorded MMN for five different sound features (duration, frequency, intensity, location, and gap). Our results suggest hypersensitive auditory change detection in Asperger syndrome, as reflected in the enhanced MMN for deviant sounds with a gap or shorter duration, and speeded MMN elicitation for frequency changes.
17242622		Structure of the autism symptom phenotype: A proposed multidimensional model.	Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry	2007	Stelios Georgiades, Peter Szatmari, Lonnie Zwaigenbaum, Eric Duku, Susan Bryson, Wendy Roberts, Jeremy Goldberg, William Mahoney		The main objective of this study was to develop a comprehensive, empirical model that will allow the reorganization of the structure of the pervasive developmental disorder symptom phenotype through factor analysis into more homogeneous dimensions.
17240169		Neurophysiological correlates of relatively enhanced local visual search in autistic adolescents.	NeuroImage	2007	Zina M Manjaly, Nicole Bruning, Susanne Neufang, Klaas E Stephan, Sarah Brieber, John C Marshall, Inge Kamp-Becker, Helmut Remschmidt, Beate Herpertz-Dahlmann, Kerstin Konrad, Gereon R Fink		"Previous studies found normal or even superior performance of autistic patients on visuospatial tasks requiring local search, like the Embedded Figures Task (EFT). A well-known interpretation of this is ""weak central coherence"", i.e. autistic patients may show a reduced general ability to process information in its context and may therefore have a tendency to favour local over global aspects of information processing. An alternative view is that the local processing advantage in the EFT may result from a relative amplification of early perceptual processes which boosts processing of local stimulus properties but does not affect processing of global context. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 12 autistic adolescents (9 Asperger and 3 high-functioning autistic patients) and 12 matched controls to help distinguish, on neurophysiological grounds, between these two accounts of EFT performance in autistic patients. Behaviourally, we found autistic individuals to be unimpaired during the EFT while they were significantly worse at performing a closely matched control task with minimal local search requirements. The fMRI results showed that activations specific for the local search aspects of the EFT were left-lateralised in parietal and premotor areas for the control group (as previously demonstrated for adults), whereas for the patients these activations were found in right primary visual cortex and bilateral extrastriate areas. These results suggest that enhanced local processing in early visual areas, as opposed to impaired processing of global context, is characteristic for performance of the EFT by autistic patients."
17239046		Cognitive and symptom profiles in Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2007	Tomonori Koyama, Hisateru Tachimori, Hirokazu Osada, Toshinobu Takeda, Hiroshi Kurita		Asperger syndrome (AS) and autistic disorder are two subtypes of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), but there has been considerable debate over whether AS and autistic disorder without mental retardation (IQ > or = 70), called high-functioning autism (HFA), are distinct conditions or not. The aim of the present paper was to clarify this issue through a comparison of cognitive function and autistic symptom profiles. Based on the DSM-IV and ICD-10 definitions of language acquisition, 36 age- and IQ-balanced subjects with AS (mean age, 12.8 years; mean full-scale IQ, 98.3) were compared with 37 subjects with HFA (mean age, 12.6 years; mean full-scale IQ, 94.6) on the Japanese version of the Wechsler Intelligence Scales and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale-Tokyo Version (CARS-TV). Compared with the HFA subjects, the AS subjects scored significantly higher on Verbal IQ, Vocabulary, and Comprehension, but scored significantly lower on Coding. Although the total CARS-TV score did not differ significantly between the two groups, AS subjects scored significantly lower (i.e. less abnormal) on Verbal communication and Non-verbal communication than did the HFA subjects. A history of normal language acquisition in early childhood could predict his/her better verbal ability in mid-childhood or later. Autistic cognitive characteristics shared by both AS and HFA subjects appear to support the validity of the current diagnostic classification of PDD.
17236348		The effectiveness of and preschoolers' preferences for variations of multiple-schedule arrangements.	Journal of applied behavior analysis	2006	Jeffrey H Tiger, Gregory P Hanley, Nicole A Heal		Multiple schedules of reinforcement have been used to teach children to recruit attention only when it is available, thereby minimizing disruptive requesting during instructional activities. This procedure involves alternating periods of continuous reinforcement (CRF) with periods of extinction and correlating each period with a distinct and continuous discriminative stimulus. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of and children's preferences for multiple schedules in which (a) two different stimuli, one correlated with reinforcement (S+) and another correlated with extinction (S-), were presented; (b) only an S+ was presented (i.e., no stimulus was correlated with extinction), and (c) neither an S+ nor an S- was presented (i.e., a mixed schedule). S+/S- and S+ arrangements were similarly effective for 7 children, but 3 preferred the S+/S- condition and 4 preferred the S+ condition. Correlational analyses suggested that children who responded more effectively given the S- (discrimination indexes were relatively high) preferred the S+/S- condition, whereas children who responded less effectively given the S- preferred the S+ condition. The implications of these findings for arranging multiple schedules for social responses are discussed.
17235583		A giant pancreatic serous microcystic adenoma with 20 years follow-up.	Langenbeck's archives of surgery	2007	Hans-Ulrich Schulz, Udo Kellner, Stefan Kahl, Olaf Effenberger, Walter Asperger, Hans Lippert, Christoph Röcken		There is only little information about the spontaneous course of large pancreatic serous tumours. We followed up a white woman with a giant serous microcystic adenoma over more than 20 years.
17230427		[Frankfurt group social communication and interaction skills training for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders].	Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie	2007	Evelyn Herbrecht, Fritz Poustka		Despite the recognition of the need for group-based training programmes for children and adolescents with autistic disorders, there are only very few specific German-speaking training programmes available. Since 2003, a structured group training programme on social skills for children and adolescents with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome has been developed and conducted at our department. The training programme focuses on the main deficits of those disorders. Thus, the primary goal is to improve communication and interaction skills.
17224135		Caudate nucleus is enlarged in high-functioning medication-naive subjects with autism.	Biological psychiatry	2007	Marieke Langen, Sarah Durston, Wouter G Staal, Saskia J M C Palmen, Herman van Engeland		Autism is defined by three symptom clusters, including repetitive and stereotyped behavior. Previous studies have implicated basal ganglia in these behaviors. Earlier studies investigating basal ganglia in autism have included subjects on neuroleptics known to affect basal ganglia volumes. Therefore, we investigated these structures in medication-naive subjects with autism.
17216559		Social skills training for adolescents with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Jeanie Tse, Jack Strulovitch, Vicki Tagalakis, Linyan Meng, Eric Fombonne		The effectiveness of a social skills training group for adolescents with Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism (AS/HFA) was evaluated. Parents of six groups of adolescents (n = 46, 61% male, mean age 14.6) completed questionnaires immediately before and after the 12-week group. Parents and adolescents were surveyed regarding their experience with the group. Significant pre- to post-treatment gains were found on measures of both social competence and problem behaviors associated with AS/HFA. Effect sizes ranged from .34 to .72. Adolescents reported more perceived skill improvements than did parents. Parent-reported improvement suggests that social skills learned in group sessions generalize to settings outside the treatment group. Larger, controlled studies of social skills training groups would be valuable.
17201617		Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms in a clinic sample of children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2006	Douglas O Lee, Opal Y Ousley		The aims of this systematic chart review were to determine the frequency of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in a clinic sample of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), to compare ADHD symptoms in children with Autistic Disorder, Asperger's Disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), to compare ADHD symptoms in individuals with and without ADHD-related chief complaints, and to determine the correlation between ADHD Rating Scale (ADHD RS) scores and age.
17197079		Auditory cortical change detection in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Neuroscience letters	2007	Tuulia Lepistö, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Risto Näätänen, Teija Kujala		The present study investigated whether auditory deficits reported in children with Asperger syndrome (AS) are also present in adulthood. To this end, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from adults with AS for duration, pitch, and phonetic changes in vowels, and for acoustically matched non-speech stimuli. These subjects had enhanced mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitudes particularly for pitch and duration deviants, indicating enhanced sound-discrimination abilities. Furthermore, as reflected by the P3a, their involuntary orienting was enhanced for changes in non-speech sounds, but tended to be deficient for changes in speech sounds. The results are consistent with those reported earlier in children with AS, except for the duration-MMN, which was diminished in children and enhanced in adults.
17195104		Social skills development in children with autism spectrum disorders: a review of the intervention research.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Susan Williams White, Kathleen Keonig, Lawrence Scahill		Social reciprocity deficits are a core feature of the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This review summarizes the state of research in group-based social skills training programs for school-age children and adolescents with ASD. All published studies of group social skills interventions between 1985 and 2006 were reviewed, as well as dissertations examining group-based social skills intervention programs. To assess the state of the science, a template developed by an NIMH work group was applied to 14 identified studies. Based on this review, the empirical support for this approach is incomplete, but promising intervention strategies were identified. Recommendations for the design of future treatment trials to guide clinical practice are offered.
17180461		Emotion perception in Asperger's syndrome and high-functioning autism: the importance of diagnostic criteria and cue intensity.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Carla A Mazefsky, Donald P Oswald		This study compared emotion perception accuracy between children with Asperger's syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA). Thirty children were diagnosed with AS or HFA based on empirically supported diagnostic criteria and administered an emotion perception test consisting of facial expressions and tone of voice cues that varied in intensity. Participants with AS and the typically developing standardization sample of the emotion perception instrument had the same mean emotion perception accuracy, whereas participants with HFA performed significantly worse. Results also provided preliminary evidence for a difference in accuracy perceiving low-intensity tone of voice cues between participants with HFA and AS. Future research to build on these initial findings should include attention to tone of voice, underlying processing, and cue intensity.
17180459		The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule: revised algorithms for improved diagnostic validity.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Katherine Gotham, Susan Risi, Andrew Pickles, Catherine Lord		Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) Modules 1-3 item and domain total distributions were reviewed for 1,630 assessments of children aged 14 months to 16 years with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or with heterogeneous non-spectrum disorders. Children were divided by language level and age to yield more homogeneous cells. Items were chosen that best differentiated between diagnoses and were arranged into domains on the basis of multi-factor item-response analysis. Reflecting recent research, the revised algorithm now consists of two new domains, Social Affect and Restricted, Repetitive Behaviors (RRB), combined to one score to which thresholds are applied, resulting in generally improved predictive value.
17175576		Disembedding performance in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2007	Nils Kaland, Erik Lykke Mortensen, Lars Smith		The aim of the present study was to assess the findings, reported in earlier studies, that individuals with autism spectrum disorders process visuo-spatial tasks faster than typically developing control persons. The participants in the present study were children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) (N = 13), and a matched group of typically developing children and adolescents (N = 13). The results showed that the participants in the clinical group performed marginally less well than those in the control group on both the Block Design Test and the Embedded Figures Test, but the differences were not statistically significant. Thus, earlier findings suggesting that individuals with autism spectrum disorders solve non-social cognitive tasks faster than typically developing control persons were not replicated. The results are discussed with special reference to the hypothesis of weak central coherence.
17173049		Mutations in the gene encoding the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are associated with autism spectrum disorders.	Nature genetics	2007	Christelle M Durand, Catalina Betancur, Tobias M Boeckers, Juergen Bockmann, Pauline Chaste, Fabien Fauchereau, Gudrun Nygren, Maria Rastam, I Carina Gillberg, Henrik Anckarsäter, Eili Sponheim, Hany Goubran-Botros, Richard Delorme, Nadia Chabane, Marie-Christine Mouren-Simeoni, Philippe de Mas, Eric Bieth, Bernadette Rogé, Delphine Héron, Lydie Burglen, Christopher Gillberg, Marion Leboyer, Thomas Bourgeron		SHANK3 (also known as ProSAP2) regulates the structural organization of dendritic spines and is a binding partner of neuroligins; genes encoding neuroligins are mutated in autism and Asperger syndrome. Here, we report that a mutation of a single copy of SHANK3 on chromosome 22q13 can result in language and/or social communication disorders. These mutations concern only a small number of individuals, but they shed light on one gene dosage-sensitive synaptic pathway that is involved in autism spectrum disorders.
17171541		Quantitative assessment of neuromotor function in adolescents with high functioning autism and Asperger Syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Christine M Freitag, Christina Kleser, Marc Schneider, Alexander von Gontard		Motor impairment in children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or High functioning autism (HFA) has been reported previously. This study presents results of a quantitative assessment of neuromotor skills in 14-22 year old HFA/AS.
17160462		Brief report: the impact of subcortical band heterotopia and associated complications on the neuropsychological functioning of a 13-year-old child.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Beata S Beaudoin, James M Hill, Sue X Ming		Motor impairment in children with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high functioning autism (HFA) has been reported previously. This study presents results of a quantitative assessment of neuromotor skills in 14-22 year old HFA/AS. Sixteen HFA/AS and 16 IQ-matched controls were assessed by the Zurich Neuromotor Assessment (ZNA). The HFA/AS group showed strongest impairments of dynamic balance skills and diadochokinesis. Motor abilities were associated with degree of social withdrawal in the full sample and severity of current autistic symptoms in the HFA/AS group. Similar motor patterns as in younger children were found in the older adolescents. The association of autistic symptoms with motor performance points towards an essential role of motor impairment in autism spectrum disorders.
17160460		Varying language register according to listener needs in speakers with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Joanne Volden, Joyce Magill-Evans, Keith Goulden, Margaret Clarke		The ability to adjust language register, or style, according to listener needs was assessed in 38 high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD. Participants were asked to explain the process of going to a restaurant to a series of listeners who varied in linguistic competence. Results showed that participants with ASD spontaneously simplified their language based on a listener's appearance and a brief introduction, but were not as adept at that adjustment as matched controls. Further stylistic adjustments were produced following increasingly specific prompts.
17160459		Brief report: recognition of emotional and non-emotional biological motion in individuals with autistic spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	B Hubert, B Wicker, D G Moore, E Monfardini, H Duverger, D Da Fonséca, C Deruelle		This study aimed to explore the perception of different components of biological movement in individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome. The ability to recognize a person's actions, subjective states, emotions, and objects conveyed by moving point-light displays was assessed in 19 participants with autism and 19 comparable typical control participants. Results showed that the participants with autism were as able as controls to name point-light displays of non-human objects and human actions. In contrast, they were significantly poorer at labeling emotional displays, suggesting that they are specifically impaired in attending to emotional states. Most studies have highlighted an emotional deficit in facial expression perception; our results extend this hypothesized deficit to the perception and interpretation of whole-body biological movements.
17160458		Brief report: social and communication abilities and disabilities in higher functioning individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Celine A Saulnier, Ami Klin		Individuals with higher functioning autism (HFA) fail to translate their cognitive potential into real-life adaptation, and the severity of their symptoms is considerable despite their intellectual ability. This paper reports on a subsample from a larger study (A. Klin et al., in press) analyzed here by autism spectrum subtypes. It focuses on the nature of ability and disability in HFA and Asperger syndrome (AS) in relation to age and IQ. Participants included 32 individuals with autism and 35 with AS. Individuals with AS had significantly higher Verbal IQ scores and less symptomatology than individuals with autism, but their Vineland scores were equally impaired, highlighting the adaptive deficits in ASD regardless of classification. No relationship was found between adaptive functioning and symptom severity.
17149668		The relationship of Asperger's characteristics and schizotypal personality traits in a non-clinical adult sample.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Ruth M Hurst, Rosemery O Nelson-Gray, John T Mitchell, Thomas R Kwapil		The study examines the relationship between Asperger's Disorder (AD) and Schizotypal Personality Disorder (SPD), mutually exclusive but similar diagnoses [DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. Washington, DC: Author]. The literature and comparison of diagnostic criteria suggest that the two disorders may overlap: AD social impairment with SPD interpersonal problems and AD communication deficits with SPD disorganized features. Questionnaire measures of AD and SPD were administered to a large non-clinical adult sample. Consistent with expectations, the Asperger's and Schizotypal questionnaires were positively correlated. Further, the social-interpersonal and communication-disorganized areas were positively correlated, though the relationship between social-interpersonal areas is particularly strong. Future research should continue to explore the relationship between AD and schizotypy to confirm current findings and improve understanding of distinctions between the disorders.
17146700		Change in autism symptoms and maladaptive behaviors in adolescents and adults with an autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Paul T Shattuck, Marsha Mailick Seltzer, Jan S Greenberg, Gael I Orsmond, Daniel Bolt, Sheilah Kring, Julie Lounds, Catherine Lord		This study examined change prospectively in autism symptoms and maladaptive behaviors during a 4.5 year period in 241 adolescents and adults with an autism spectrum disorder who were 10-52 years old (mean = 22.0) when the study began. Although many individuals' symptoms remained stable, a greater proportion of the sample experienced declines than increases in their level of autism symptoms and maladaptive behaviors, and there were significant improvements in mean levels of symptoms. Individuals with mental retardation had more autism symptoms and maladaptive behaviors than those without mental retardation, and they improved less over time. Compared to adolescents, older sample members (31 and older) had fewer maladaptive behaviors and experienced more improvement in these behaviors over time.
17146016		Amygdala volume and nonverbal social impairment in adolescent and adult males with autism.	Archives of general psychiatry	2006	Brendon M Nacewicz, Kim M Dalton, Tom Johnstone, Micah T Long, Emelia M McAuliff, Terrence R Oakes, Andrew L Alexander, Richard J Davidson		Autism is a syndrome of unknown cause, marked by abnormal development of social behavior. Attempts to link pathological features of the amygdala, which plays a key role in emotional processing, to autism have shown little consensus.
17136465		Intonation and emotion in autistic spectrum disorders.	Journal of psycholinguistic research	2007	Kathleen Hubbard, Doris A Trauner		The classic picture of an autistic individual includes an impoverished ability to interpret or express emotion. The prosody of spoken language in autistic children is thought to lack emotional content. In this study, the verbal intonation of children with autism was examined and compared to that of children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and normal controls (ctrl). Utterances elicited by repetition and by spontaneous story completion were analyzed by quantifying phonetic features (pitch, amplitude, and length) and comparing them to subjective ratings of produced emotion (happy, sad or angry). Since the most consistent phonetic correlate of these emotional targets has been demonstrated to be pitch range, speakers with autistic spectrum disorders were expected to have decreased pitch range; however in the repetition task, autistic subjects actually had a larger pitch range than the other groups. Other measures of intonation including amplitude, duration, and location of pitch peak revealed defects that are more complex than predicted. In spontaneous speech, autistic subjects performed more poorly on both phonetic targets and subjective ratings than ctrls, and AS subjects fell between autistics and normals.
17126362		Answering contextually demanding questions: pragmatic errors produced by children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	Journal of communication disorders	2007	Soile Loukusa, Eeva Leinonen, Katja Jussila, Marja-Leena Mattila, Nuala Ryder, Hanna Ebeling, Irma Moilanen		This study examined irrelevant/incorrect answers produced by children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism (7-9-year-olds and 10-12-year-olds) and normally developing children (7-9-year-olds). The errors produced were divided into three types: in Type 1, the child answered the original question incorrectly, in Type 2, the child gave a correct answer, but when asked a follow-up question, he/she explained the answer incorrectly, and in Type 3, the child first gave a correct answer or explanation, but continued answering, which ultimately led to an irrelevant answer. Analyses of Type 1 and 2 errors indicated that all the children tried to utilize contextual information, albeit incorrectly. Analyses of Type 3 errors showed that topic drifts were almost non-existent in the control group, but common in the clinical group, suggesting that these children had difficulties in stopping processing after deriving a relevant answer.
17123635		Hypercholesterolemia in Asperger syndrome: independence from lifestyle, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and social anxiety.	Psychiatry research	2007	Isabel Dziobek, Stefan M Gold, Oliver T Wolf, Antonio Convit		We report on elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in 22 individuals with Asperger syndrome compared with well-matched controls, after accounting for lifestyle variables and clinical symptomatology that could affect them. A potential role for dyslipidemia in the pathogenesis of some forms of autism is discussed.

17109783		Differences in finger length ratio between males with autism, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified, ADHD, and anxiety disorders.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2006	Esther I de Bruin, Fop Verheij, T Wiegman, Robert F Ferdinand		Children with autism have a relatively shorter index finger (2D) compared with their ring finger (4D). It is often presumed that the 2D:4D ratio is associated with fetal testosterone levels and that high fetal testosterone levels could play a role in the aetiology of autism. It is unknown whether this effect is specific to autism. In this study, 2D:4D ratios of 144 males aged 6 to 14 years (mean age 9y 1 mo [SD 1y 11 mo]) with psychiatric disorders were compared with those of 96 males aged 6 to 13 years from the general population (mean age 9y 1 mo [SD 1y 10 mo]). Psychiatric disorders were divided into autism/Asperger syndrome (n=24), pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS; n=26), attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)/oppositional defiant disorder (ODD; n=68), and anxiety disorders (n=26). Males with autism/Asperger syndrome (p<0.05) and ADHD/ODD (p<0.05) had significantly lower (though not significantly; p=0.52) ratios than males with an anxiety disorder, and males with autism/Asperger syndrome had lower ratios than those in the comparison group. These results indicated that higher fetal testosterone levels may play a role, not only in the origin of autism, but also in the aetiology of PDD-NOS and of ADHD/ODD. Males with anxiety disorders might have been exposed to lower prenatal testosterone levels.
17094060		[An integrative research model for child and adolescent psychiatry bringing together biological, psychological and social research approaches].	Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie	2006	Helmut Remschmidt	Klinik für Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und -psychotherapie, Universitätsklinikum Giessen-Marburg, Philipps-Universität Marburg, Standort Marburg, Hans-Sachs-Strasse 6, DE-35033 Marburg.	After some general remarks on the current situation of child and adolescent psychiatric research in Germany, a research concept is presented which in the course of 30 years of testing and further development has proven to be successful both in the inauguration of scientific projects, as well as in the qualification of trainees and co-workers. The nucleus of this concept is a research unit that is to a large extent independent of the daily health care routine. Some of the unit staff members are natural scientists holding permanent positions, complemented by a secondary labour force of young doctors and psychologists aspiring to a scientific career. This research unit provides supply for scientific projects and basic research, as well as for the development of new methods. The unit was endorsed by a Clinical Research Group funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) that proved of value as power supply for research (e.g. by raising substantial third-party funds) and as an instrument for the qualification of young scientists. The article describes some results of four research projects derived from this approach (schizophrenia research, dyslexia research, research on Asperger syndrome, quality assurance, and therapy evaluation research).
17088278		Parents' experience of having a child with autism and learning disabilities living in a group home: a case study.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Ylva Benderix, Berit Nordström, Bengt Sivberg		Some children with autism and learning disabilities also have aberrant behaviours that are difficult to regulate and stressful for both the child and family members. This case study concerns experiences of 10 parents from five families before and 2 years after entrusting their 10- to 11-year-old child with autism to a group home. Hermeneutic phenomenological analysis of narrative interviews with the parents before the child's moving showed them experiencing grief and sorrow, total exhaustion because of inability to regulate their child's behaviours, social isolation, and negative effects on the child's siblings, but experiencing themselves as more sympathetic than previously towards other people with problems. Two years later they experienced relief for the family due to the group home arrangement and the child's improvement, but with an ethical dilemma which made them feel guilty, despite increased hope for the future. Some also felt unhappy with the staff situation at the group home.
17088277		Understanding and negotiating friendships: perspectives from an adolescent with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Brooke Howard, Ellen Cohn, Gael I Orsmond		This case study explored perceptions of friendship of an adolescent with Asperger syndrome. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, photographs taken by the adolescent, and quality of life and friendship measures. Data were analyzed using grounded theory principles and organized into three themes: (1) characteristics of a friend, (2) family involvement, and (3) enjoyment of friendships and desire to have them. The adolescent appeared to enjoy having friends, was interested in pursuing friendships, and had a basic understanding of many characteristics of friendships. He described negotiating his own and his friend's focused interests. Family members played important roles in the establishment and maintenance of the adolescent's friendships.
17088273		A comparative study of circadian rhythm functioning and sleep in people with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Dougal Julian Hare, Steven Jones, Kate Evershed		The circadian rhythm functioning and sleep patterns of 10 adults with Asperger syndrome were investigated using actigraphy. When compared with data from neurotypical adults, both statistical and clinically significant differences were found between the two groups, with the adults with Asperger syndrome showing marked abnormalities in both the quantity and the quality of sleep recorded. Examination of the actigraphic data indicated low sleep efficiency and high fragmentation as being characteristic of the sleep of participants with Asperger syndrome. These individuals also showed lower-amplitude circadian rhythms that were less strongly linked to environmental synchronizers, but no evidence of significant desynchronization of circadian rhythm. Possible mechanisms for these abnormalities and implications for clinical practice are discussed.
17088272		Neuropsychological functioning in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Fiona Z Ambery, Ailsa J Russell, Katie Perry, Robin Morris, Declan G M Murphy		There is some consensus in the literature regarding the cognitive profile of people with Asperger syndrome (AS). Findings to date suggest that a proportion of people with AS have higher verbal than performance IQ, a non-verbal learning disability (NVLD) and impairments in some aspects of executive function (EF). However, there are few published studies on adults with AS and many have compared the AS group to an autistic control group alone. We compared cognitive functioning in 27 AS adults without a history of language delay and 20 normal controls who did not differ significantly in age, gender and IQ. People with AS had significant impairments on a test of visual memory and on EF tasks measuring flexibility and generativity, but not inhibition. There was no significant difference between verbal and performance IQ. Our results suggest that impairments on tests requiring flexibility of thought and generation occur at all ages and across a range of autistic disorders including AS.
17087486		Are peer support groups for adolescents with Asperger's syndrome helpful?	Clinical child psychology and psychiatry	2006	Bernhard Weidle, Britt Bolme, Anne Lise Hoeyland		There is very little documentation dealing with peer support groups for people with Asperger's syndrome, and especially about groups for adolescents. This article gives a description of three such groups that were run in parallel with support groups for parents. The great majority of the participants completed the course of the group. In a consumer satisfaction survey, the majority of the participants (76.5%) and nearly all of their parents (95%) rated satisfaction with the group meetings as good or very good. These responses indicate that adolescents with Asperger's syndrome and their parents perceive peer support groups as helpful.
17086441		A comparative study of the use and understanding of self-presentational display rules in children with high functioning autism and Asperger's disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Josephine Barbaro, Cheryl Dissanayake		The use and understanding of self-presentational display rules (SPDRs) was investigated in 21 children with high-functioning autism (HFA), 18 children with Asperger's disorder (AspD) and 20 typically developing (TD) children (all male, aged 4- to 11-years, matched on mental age). Their behaviour was coded during a deception scenario to assess use of SPDRs; understanding of SPDRs was assessed via three real/apparent emotion-understanding vignettes. The children with HFA and AspD used less effective SPDRs than the TD children, but there were no group differences in understanding SPDRs. The children with HFA and AspD did not differ on their use or understanding of SPDRs, and the results are discussed in relation to the similarities and differences between these diagnostic conditions.
17086440		Processing of affective speech prosody is impaired in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Pirjo Korpilahti, Eira Jansson-Verkasalo, Marja-Leena Mattila, Sanna Kuusikko, Kalervo Suominen, Seppo Rytky, David L Pauls, Irma Moilanen		Many people with the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (AS) show poorly developed skills in understanding emotional messages. The present study addressed discrimination of speech prosody in children with AS at neurophysiological level. Detection of affective prosody was investigated in one-word utterances as indexed by the N1 and the mismatch negativity (MMN) of auditory event-related potentials (ERPs). Data from fourteen boys with AS were compared with those for thirteen typically developed boys. These results suggest atypical neural responses to affective prosody in children with AS and their fathers, especially over the RH, and that this impairment can already be seen at low-level information processes. Our results provide evidence for familial patterns of abnormal auditory brain reactions to prosodic features of speech.
17082978		A randomized controlled trial of a cognitive behavioural intervention for anger management in children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Kate Sofronoff, Tony Attwood, Sharon Hinton, Irina Levin		The purpose of the study described was to evaluate the effectiveness of a cognitive behavioural intervention for anger management with children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Forty-five children and their parents were randomly assigned to either intervention or wait-list control conditions. Children in the intervention participated in six 2-h weekly sessions while parents participated in a larger parent group. Parent reports indicated a significant decrease in episodes of anger following intervention and a significant increase in their own confidence in managing anger in their child. Qualitative information gathered from parents and teachers indicated some generalization of strategies learned in the clinic setting to both home and school settings. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are also discussed.
17082975		Educational placements and service use patterns of individuals with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Susan Williams White, Lawrence Scahill, Ami Klin, Kathleen Koenig, Fred R Volkmar		This project was undertaken to identify child characteristics associated with educational placement and service use in high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders. The sample of 101 (nine females) had a mean age of 12 +/- 3 years (mean IQ = 101.77 +/- 19.50). Results indicate that lower-cognitive ability and communication skill were associated with placement in special education. Based on parent-report, most students stayed in the same placement (regular or special education) in which they began first grade and the majority of students received special services in their schools (most often speech/language intervention). Findings highlight the emphasis placed on certain child characteristics (e.g., cognitive ability), with far less emphasis on other areas (e.g., degree of social deficit), in educational placement and service provision.
17080275		Atypical lexical/semantic processing in high-functioning autism spectrum disorders without early language delay.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Yoko Kamio, Diana Robins, Elizabeth Kelley, Brook Swainson, Deborah Fein		Although autism is associated with impaired language functions, the nature of semantic processing in high-functioning pervasive developmental disorders (HFPDD) without a history of early language delay has been debated. In this study, we aimed to examine whether the automatic lexical/semantic aspect of language is impaired or intact in these population. Eleven individuals with Asperger's Disorder (AS) or HFPDD-Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) and age-, IQ-, and gender-matched typically developing individuals performed a semantic decision task in four conditions using an indirect priming paradigm. Semantic priming effects were found for near-semantically related word pairs in the controls, whereas this was not the case in the AS or HFPDDNOS participants. This finding suggests similarities in the underlying semantic processing of language across PDD subtypes.
17080273		Clarifying the associations between language and social development in autism: a study of non-native phoneme recognition.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	John N Constantino, Dan Yang, Teddi L Gray, Maggie M Gross, Anna M Abbacchi, Sarah C Smith, Catherine E Kohn, Patricia K Kuhl		Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by correlated deficiencies in social and language development. This study explored a fundamental aspect of auditory information processing (AIP) that is dependent on social experience and critical to early language development: the ability to compartmentalize close-sounding speech sounds into singular phonemes. We examined this ability by assessing whether close-sounding non-native language phonemes were more likely to be perceived as disparate sounds by school-aged children with high-functioning ASD (n = 27), than by unaffected control subjects (n = 35). No significant group differences were observed. Although earlier in autistic development there may exist qualitative deficits in this specific aspect of AIP, they are not an enduring characteristic of verbal school-aged children with ASD.

17076065		Visual form-processing deficits in autism.	Perception	2006	Janine V Spencer, Justin M D O'Brien		People with autism have a number of reported deficits in object recognition and global processing. Is there a low-level spatial integration deficit associated with this? We measured spatial-form-coherence detection thresholds using a Glass stimulus in a field of random dots, and compared performance to a similar motion-coherence task. A coherent visual patch was depicted by dots separated by a rotational transformation in space (form) or space-time (motion). To measure parallel visual integration, stimuli were presented for only 250 ms. We compared detection thresholds for children with autism, children with Asperger syndrome, and a matched control group. Children with autism showed a significant form-coherence deficit and a significant motion-coherence deficit, while the performance of the children with Asperger syndrome did not differ significantly from that of controls on either task.
17072753		Brief report: individual social-multi-modal intervention for HFASD.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Nirit Bauminger	School of Education, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, 52900, Israel. bauminn@mail.biu.ac.il	This research is the first part of a 2-year cognitive-behavioral-ecological (CB-E) social skills training for high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorder (HFASD). Current study examined efficacy of an individual CB-E intervention in facilitating children's dyadic interactions (immediately after treatment and 4 months later) and their social cognition capabilities (e.g., emotion understanding and recognition, social problem solving). Participants were 19 HFASD children aged 7 years and 7 months to 11 years and 6 months. Results demonstrated improvement in children's social cognition and positive dyadic interaction and decrease in children's low-level social interaction behavior. Long-term evaluation revealed maintenance of improvement. Progress in children's cooperation, self-control, and assertiveness was reported by their teachers. Discussion focused on CB-E intervention efficacy in promoting integral social functioning for HF children with ASD.
17072752		Brief report: group social-multimodal intervention for HFASD.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Nirit Bauminger	School of Education, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan 52900, Israel. bauminn@mail.biu.ac.il	Current study is the second part of a 2-year cognitive-behavioral-ecological (CB-E) intervention for high-functioning (HF) children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We examined the utility of a group-centered intervention on children's ability to interact cooperatively with peers during structured and non-structured social situations. Direct (e.g., social problem solving) and indirect (theory of mind; executive function) treatment effects on social cognitive capabilities were also examined. Participants were 26 preadolescent HF children with ASD. Study results demonstrated direct and indirect treatment effects on social cognition and mixed results regarding children's social interaction capabilities. Although children's cooperative capabilities within the intervention group improved, dyadic, and group social interactions during school recess did not. Discussion focused on the utility of such group-intervention in increasing social functioning.
17072751		Use of context in pragmatic language comprehension by children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Soile Loukusa, Eeva Leinonen, Sanna Kuusikko, Katja Jussila, Marja-Leena Mattila, Nuala Ryder, Hanna Ebeling, Irma Moilanen		Utilizing relevance theory, this study investigated the ability of children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) to use context when answering questions and when giving explanations for their correct answers. Three groups participated in this study: younger AS/HFA group (age 7-9, n=16), older AS/HFA group (age 10-12, n=23) and a normally functioning control group (age 7-9, n=23). The results indicated that the younger AS/HFA group did less well when answering contextually demanding questions compared to the control group, and the performance of the older AS/HFA group fell in between the younger AS/HFA group and the control group. Both AS/HFA groups had difficulties explaining their correct answers, suggesting that they are not always aware of how they have derived answers from the context.
17072749		The 'Reading the Mind in the Voice' test-revised: a study of complex emotion recognition in adults with and without autism spectrum conditions.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Ofer Golan, Simon Baron-Cohen, Jacqueline J Hill, M D Rutherford		This study reports a revised version of the 'Reading the Mind in the Voice' (RMV) task. The original task (Rutherford et al., (2002), Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 32, 189-194) suffered from ceiling effects and limited sensitivity. To improve that, the task was shortened and two more foils were added to each of the remaining items. About 50 adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or High Functioning Autism (HFA) and 22 matched controls took the revised task. Results show the revised task has good reliability and validity, is harder, and more sensitive in distinguishing the AS/HFA group from controls. Verbal IQ was positively correlated with performance, and females performed worse than males in the AS/HFA group. Results are discussed with regard to multi modal empathizing deficits in autism spectrum conditions (ASC).
17069548		Open-label atomoxetine for attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder symptoms associated with high-functioning pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2006	David J Posey, Ryan E Wiegand, Jennifer Wilkerson, Melissa Maynard, Kimberly A Stigler, Christopher J McDougle		The aim of this study was to conduct an initial evaluation of the efficacy of atomoxetine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs).
17069543		A double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study of olanzapine in childhood/adolescent pervasive developmental disorder.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2006	Eric Hollander, Stacey Wasserman, Erika N Swanson, William Chaplin, Melissa L Schapiro, Karen Zagursky, Sherie Novotny		Atypical antipsychotics have been shown to improve disruptive and repetitive behaviors in pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), but they require assessment of potential side effects. This is the first placebo-controlled trial of olanzapine in the treatment of children and adolescents with PDD. Eleven patients with a diagnosis of either autism, Asperger's syndrome, or PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and aged 6-14 years were randomized into an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel treatment study with olanzapine. There was a significant linear trend x group interaction on the Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement (CGI-I) and 50% on olanzapine versus 20% on placebo were responders. Olanzapine was associated with significant weight gain (7.5 +/- 4.8 lbs vs. 1.5 +/- 1.5 lbs on placebo). Olanzapine may be a promising treatment for improving global functioning of PDDs, but the risk of significant weight gain remains a concern. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in the treatment of children with PDD.
17066307		Inhibitory control in children with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Shawn E Christ, Daniel D Holt, Desirée A White, Leonard Green		Impairments in executive abilities such as cognitive flexibility have been identified in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It remains unclear, however, whether such individuals also experience impairments in another executive ability: inhibitory control. In the present study, we administered three inhibitory tasks to 18 children with ASD, 23 siblings of children with ASD, and 25 typically developing children. After controlling for individual differences in age, overall IQ, and processing speed, children with ASD demonstrated impaired performance on two of the three inhibitory tasks. Results suggest that children with ASD experience circumscribed deficits in some but not all aspects of inhibitory control. More generally, the findings underscore the importance of using multiple measures to assess a putative single cognitive ability.
17032961		Asperger's disorder and criminal behavior: forensic-psychiatric considerations.	The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law	2006	Barbara G Haskins, J Arturo Silva		Asperger's Disorder remains an under-diagnosed condition because of clinical unfamiliarity with its adult presentation. As forensic clinicians become familiar with the presentation of Asperger's disorder, it appears that affected individuals are over-represented in forensic criminal settings. Unique features of such persons may heighten their risks for engaging in criminal behavior. Both Theory of Mind deficits and a predilection for intense narrow interests, when coupled with deficient social awareness of salient interpersonal and social constraints on behavior, can result in criminal acts. We discuss comorbidities of forensic relevance. We present several cases that highlight these issues and review the relevant forensic literature. Furthermore, there may be valid questions as to degree of criminal responsibility in such persons. From a neuropsychiatric perspective, these disorders appear to have a biological underpinning for deficits in empathy, a finding that may have important repercussions when assessing remorse in criminal proceedings.
17031448		Memory illusion in high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Yoko Kamio, Motomi Toichi		In this study, 13 individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA), 15 individuals with Asperger's disorder (AD), and age-, and IQ-matched controls were presented a list of sentences auditorily. Participants then evaluated semantically related but new sentences and reported whether they were old or new. The total rates of false recognition for semantically related sentences were similar among the three groups. Nevertheless, memory illusion on some aspects was reduced in HFA participants. These results suggest that HFA have difficulties in semantic association. Although individuals with AD showed no quantitative abnormalities of memory illusion, some contributing factors were atypical. These findings are discussed in terms of schema theory, enhanced perceptual processing hypothesis, and weak central coherence hypothesis.
17030291		Asperger's syndrome.	Adolescent medicine clinics	2006	James McPartland, Ami Klin		Asperger's syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by social impairments and rigid and repetitive interests or behaviors paired with relatively preserved cognitive and verbal facilities. This article describes the clinical manifestation of the disorder and guidelines for diagnostic assessment and intervention. Existing research is reviewed within the areas of epidemiology, medical/neurobiologic factors, genetics, and outcome, and future directions for research are recommended.
17029020		Autism in the Faroe Islands: an epidemiological study.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Asa Ellefsen, Hanna Kampmann, Eva Billstedt, I Carina Gillberg, Christopher Gillberg		The Faroe Islands are considered to be a genetic isolate. This population study of the prevalence of autism sought to identify a representative cohort for future genetic studies. In 2002 all schools were screened for autism spectrum disorders. The target population were all children born in 1985 through 1994 and living in the Faroe Islands on December 31, 2002. Children who screened positive for autism characteristics were examined using the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO). Of the children aged 8 through 17 years, 0.56% had childhood autism, Asperger syndrome or atypical autism. The male:female ratio was just under 6:1. The prevalence of autism in the Faroe Islands was very similar to that reported from many western countries.
17029019		Brief report: perception of body posture--what individuals with autism spectrum disorder might be missing.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Catherine L Reed, Paula M Beall, Valerie E Stone, Lila Kopelioff, Danielle J Pulham, Susan L Hepburn		Autism has been associated with atypical face and configural processing, as indicated by the lack of a face inversion effect (better recognition of upright than inverted faces). We investigated whether such atypical processing was restricted to the face or extended to social information found in body postures. An inversion paradigm compared recognition of upright and inverted faces, body postures, and houses. Typical adults demonstrated inversion effects for both faces and body postures, but adults with autism demonstrated only a face inversion effect. Adults with autism may not have a configural processing deficit per se, but instead may have strategies for recognizing faces not used for body postures. Results have implications for therapies employing training in imitation and body posture perception.
17021155		Napoleon Dynamite: Asperger's disorder or Geek NOS?	Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry	2006	Hope W Levin, Steven Schlozman		"Napoleon Dynamite, the quirky hit film from 2004, is a fascinating portrayal of a teenager with social difficulties. The character Napoleon provokes intriguing diagnostic questions in distinguishing between mental illness and the spectrum of normal behavior. He demonstrates several symptoms of Asperger's disorder, yet he also challenges the notion that children and adolescents with Asperger's spectrum disorders will not be accepted or understood. He forms genuine, connected friendships, and fans of the movie appear to celebrate his quirkiness rather than ridicule his oddities. The authors explore the extent to which cultural issues have an impact on psychiatric phenomenology, as well as the potential treatment issues for someone with his apparent social challenges. Finally, the authors offer possible explanations for Napoleon's immense popularity, especially among adolescents. With the rise of computer technology, our culture has fully embraced the idea of what has come to be called ""geekdom,"" and the authors consider the idea that Napoleon's popularity may be a more rural equivalent for this phenomenon. The success of the movie appears to be related to a genuine celebration of Napoleon himself."
17004120		Systematic screening for subtelomeric anomalies in a clinical sample of autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Thomas H Wassink, Molly Losh, Joseph Piven, Val C Sheffield, Elizabeth Ashley, Erik R Westin, Shivanand R Patil		High-resolution karyotyping detects cytogenetic anomalies in 5-10% of cases of autism. Karyotyping, however, may fail to detect abnormalities of chromosome subtelomeres, which are gene rich regions prone to anomalies. We assessed whether panels of FISH probes targeted for subtelomeres could detect abnormalities beyond those identified by karyotyping in 104 individuals with Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) drawn from a general clinical population. Four anomalies were detected by karyotyping, while no additional anomalies were detected by subtelomere FISH or by probes targeted for 15q11.2q13 or 22q11.2 in subgroups of our sample. We conclude that while karyotyping may be more broadly indicated for autism than previously supposed, subtelomere FISH appears less likely to be a useful screening tool for unselected PDD populations.

17001527		Sleep disturbances and correlates of children with autism spectrum disorders.	Child psychiatry and human development	2006	Xianchen Liu, Julie A Hubbard, Richard A Fabes, James B Adam		This study examined sleep patterns, sleep problems, and their correlates in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Subjects consisted of 167 ASD children, including 108 with autistic disorder, 27 with Asperger's syndrome, and 32 with other diagnoses of ASD. Mean age was 8.8 years (SD = 4.2), 86% were boys. Parents completed a self-administered child sleep questionnaire. Results showed that average night sleep duration was 8.9 h (SD = 1.8), 16% of children shared a bed with parent. About 86% of children had at least one sleep problem almost every day, including 54% with bedtime resistance, 56% with insomnia, 53% with parasomnias, 25% with sleep disordered breathing, 45% with morning rise problems, and 31% with daytime sleepiness. Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that younger age, hypersensitivity, co-sleeping, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, bedtime ritual, medication use, and family history of sleep problems were related to sleep problems. Comorbid epilepsy, insomnia, and parasomnias were associated with increased risk for daytime sleepiness. Results suggest that both dyssomnias and parasomnias are very prevalent in children with ASD. Although multiple child and family factors are associated with sleep problems, other comorbid disorders of autism may play a major role.
17000470		A prospective assessment of porphyrins in autistic disorders: a potential marker for heavy metal exposure.	Neurotoxicity research	2006	David A Geier, Mark R Geier		Autism was recently associated with a urinary porphyrin pattern indicative of mercury toxicity in a large cohort of French children. The IRB of the Institute for Chronic Illnesses approved the present study. A total of 37 consecutive American patients (> or = 7 years-old) with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-DSM IV), born from 1983-1998, that presented to the Genetic Centers of America for outpatient genetic evaluations were prospectively examined for urinary prophryin levels (LabCorp, Inc.) from June 2005-June 2006. Imaging and laboratory testing were conducted on each patient to rule-out other causal factors for their ASDs. As controls, age-, sex-, and race-matched neurotypical ASD siblings were examined. An apparent dose-response effect was observed between autism severity and increased urinary coproporphyrins. Patients with non-chelated autism (2.25-fold, 83% had levels > 2 SD above the control mean) and non-chelated ASDs (2-fold, 58% had levels > 2 SD above the control mean), but not patients with non-chelated pervasive developmental delay-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) or Asperger's disorder (1.4-fold, 46% had levels > 2 SD above the control mean), had significantly increased median coproporphyrin levels versus controls. A significant increase (1.7-fold) in median coproporphyrin levels was observed among non-chelated ASD patients versus chelated ASD patients. Porphyrins should be routinely clinically measured in ASDs, and potential ASD treatments should consider monitoring porphyrin levels. Additional research should be conducted to evaluate the potential role for mercury exposure in some ASDs.
16996401		Teenage outcome after being born at term with moderate neonatal encephalopathy.	Pediatric neurology	2006	Katarina Lindström, Peter Lagerroos, Christopher Gillberg, Elisabeth Fernell		The aim of this study was to assess cognitive functions and behavior problems in teenagers who survived moderate neonatal encephalopathy and did not develop cerebral palsy. The study population comprised all 97,468 individuals born in Sweden in 1985. Of these, 684 (0.7%) were born at term and had an Apgar score of <7 at 5 minutes. The obstetric and neonatal records were scrutinized and the individuals were classified according to degree of neonatal encephalopathy. Teenagers with moderate neonatal encephalopathy without cerebral palsy and other major neuro-impairments were subjected to a clinical assessment including interviews, neuropsychological tests, and assessments of data from records. Age at examination was 15-19 years. Fifty-six individuals who had moderate neonatal encephalopathy were identified. Thirteen (23%) had parents who declined participation in the study. Of the remaining 43 subjects, 15 (30%) had a diagnosis of cerebral palsy or other major neuro-impairments and 28 had no such impairments. The latter group was examined, 20 of whom (71%) had definite cognitive dysfunctions. Five (18%) had hearing impairments. Only eight teenagers were without impairments. Of those who did not have cerebral palsy, the majority had cognitive/executive problems that interfered with their daily life situation. Clinical follow-up, including assessments of cognitive functions before school start, should be considered for all individuals in this high-risk group.
16979876		Self-face recognition and theory of mind in patients with schizophrenia and first-degree relatives.	Schizophrenia research	2006	Farzin Irani, Steven M Platek, Ivan S Panyavin, Monica E Calkins, Christian Kohler, Steven J Siegel, Michael Schachter, Raquel E Gur, Ruben C Gur		The hypothesized relationship between theory of mind (ToM) and self-face recognition as well as its potential genetic associations has not been previously explored in patients with schizophrenia and in first-degree relatives with schizotypal personality traits.
16977495		Psychological and neurobehavioral comparisons of children with Asperger's Disorder versus High-Functioning Autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Linda L Thede, Frederick L Coolidge		This study investigated personality and neurobehavioral differences between 16 children with Asperger's Disorder, 15 children with High-Functioning Autism (HFA), and 31 controls, all ranging in age from 5-17 years, M age = 10.7 years, SD = 3.0. Parents rated their children's behaviors on a 44-item autistic symptoms survey and on the 200-item Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory (Coolidge, Thede, Stewart, & Segal (2002a). The Coolidge Personality and Neuropsychological Inventory for Children (CPNI): Preliminary psychometric characteristics. Behavior Modification, 26, 550-566). The results indicated that the two clinical samples were significantly elevated on the Executive Function Deficits scale and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) scale compared to controls. There were more similarities than differences between the two clinical samples on the personality scales, although the Asperger's group scored significantly on the two scales with anxiety components.
16961948		Motivational processes and autonomic responsivity in Asperger's disorder: evidence from the Iowa Gambling Task.	Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	2006	Shannon A Johnson, Eldad Yechiam, Robin R Murphy, Sarah Queller, Julie C Stout		Asperger's disorder (ASP), like other autism spectrum disorders, is associated with altered responsiveness to social stimuli. This study investigated learning and responsiveness to nonsocial, but motivational, stimuli in ASP. We examined choice behavior and galvanic skin conductance responses (SCRs) during the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT; Bechara et al., 1994) in 15 adolescents and young adults with ASP and 14 comparison subjects. We examined aspects of learning, attention to wins and losses, and response style with a formal cognitive model, the Expectancy-Valence Learning model (Busemeyer & Stout, 2002). The ASP group did not differ from the comparison group in proportions of selections from advantageous decks. However, ASP participants showed a distinct pattern of selection characterized by frequent shifts between the four IGT decks, whereas comparison participants developed clear deck preferences. SCR results showed some evidence of reduced responsiveness in the ASP group during the IGT. Results from the cognitive model indicated that, in contrast to the comparison group, the ASP group's selections were less consistent with the motivational significance they assigned to decks. Findings are discussed in the context of the neurobiological substrates associated with IGT performance.
16958304		[Differential diagnosis of psychopathy and autism spectrum disorders in adults. Empathic deficit as a core symptom].	Tijdschrift voor psychiatrie	2006	M A Hansman-Wijnands, J W Hummelen		There is an overlap between the symptoms of psychopathy and autism spectrum disorders.
16953688		Understanding of emotional experience in autism: insights from the personal accounts of high-functioning children with autism.	Developmental psychology	2006	Molly Losh, Lisa Capps		In this study, the authors investigate emotional understanding in autism through a discourse analytic framework to provide a window into children's strategies for interpreting emotional versus nonemotional encounters and consider the implications for the mechanisms underlying emotional understanding in typical development. Accounts were analyzed for thematic content and discourse structure. Whereas high-functioning children with autism were able to discuss contextually appropriate accounts of simple emotions, their strategies for interpreting all types of emotional (but not nonemotional) experiences differed from those used by typically developing children. High-functioning children with autism were less inclined to organize their emotional accounts in personalized causal-explanatory frameworks and displayed a tendency to describe visually salient elements of experiences seldom observed among comparison children. Findings suggest that children with autism possess less coherent representations of emotional experiences and use alternative strategies for interpreting emotionally evocative encounters. Discussion focuses on the significance of these findings for informing the nature of emotional dysfunction in autism as well as implications for theories of emotional understanding in typical development.
16944324		The autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) children's version in Japan: a cross-cultural comparison.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Akio Wakabayashi, Simon Baron-Cohen, Tokio Uchiyama, Yuko Yoshida, Yoshikuni Tojo, Miho Kuroda, Sally Wheelwright		In the current study, the child AQ was administered in Japan, to examine whether the UK results for reliability and validity generalize to a different culture. Assessment groups were: Group 1: n = 81 children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: n = 22 children diagnosed PDD-NOS with average IQ; and Group 3: n = 372 randomly selected controls from primary and secondary schools. Both clinical groups scored significantly higher than controls (AS/HFA mean AQ = 31.9, SD = 6.93; PDD-NOS mean AQ = 28.0, SD = 6.88; controls mean AQ = 11.7, SD = 5.94). Among the controls, males scored significantly higher than females. The pattern of difference between clinical groups and controls was found to be similar in both countries.
16940313		Mothers' attributions following their child's diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder: exploring links with maternal levels of stress,depression and expectations about their child's future.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Emily Dale, Andrew Jahoda, Fiona Knott		Although the impact of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) on the family is well recognized, the way mothers attempt to make sense of the diagnosis is largely unexplored. However, in other disabilities, attributions have been shown to predict a variety of outcomes including maternal wellbeing and engagement in treatment. Using Weiner's (1985) three-dimensional model, 16 mothers were interviewed to examine the nature and impact of their beliefs about their child's ASD using semi-structured interviews and measures of depression, parenting stress and expectations for their child's future. The findings suggested that mothers made a diverse and complex range of attributions that were consistent with Weiner's dimensions of locus of cause, stability and controllability. The nature of their attributions reflected particular difficulties associated with ASDs, such as uncertainties regarding cause and prognosis. Taking account of mothers' search for meaning will better enable professionals to support families following diagnosis.
16940311		How many doctors does it take to make an autism spectrum diagnosis?	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Robin P Goin-Kochel, Virginia H Mackintosh, Barbara J Myers		Parents of children with pervasive developmental disorders (n = 494) were surveyed to determine their level of satisfaction with the process of getting an autism spectrum diagnosis. Participants in this web-based study (mean age = 37.8 years) came from five countries and reported on children with an average age of 8.3 years (range = 1.7 to 22.1). All children had a diagnosis of either autism (59.9%), Asperger syndrome (23.5%), or PDD-NOS (16.6%). Higher levels of parental education and income were associated with earlier diagnosis and greater satisfaction with the diagnostic process. Parents were more satisfied with the diagnostic process when they saw fewer professionals to get the diagnosis and when the children received the diagnoses at younger ages.
16938515		A patient with both Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome and chromosome 22q11 deletion syndrome: clue to the genetics of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome?	Journal of psychosomatic research	2006	Mary M Robertson, Bhaskara Pillai Shelley, Suraiya Dalwai, Carole Brewer, Hugo D Critchley		This is the first published case description of the association of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) and chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS; previously referred to as CATCH-22 syndrome). The co-occurrence of GTS, 22q11DS, and their behavioral/neuropsychiatric abnormalities may be due to the common endophenotypic mechanisms shared by these disorders, rather than due to specificity for GTS. Research into this genomic region may lead to advancement in neurobehavioral/neuropsychiatric genetics, which will help us in further explicating a broader perspective of gene-brain-behavior interrelationships and of the genetic underpinnings of various developmental psychopathologies and behavioral/neuropsychiatric disorders that are common to both GTS and 22q11DS. Our report should warrant further genetic investigations of the chromosome 22q11.2 deletion site using alternative strategies to the quantitative trait loci endophenotype-based approach, which would be useful for establishing the biological and molecular underpinnings of obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and GTS.
16930637		Executive processes in Asperger syndrome: patterns of performance in a multiple case series.	Neuropsychologia	2006	Elisabeth L Hill, Chris M Bird		Mixed evidence exists for executive dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This may be because of the nature of the tasks used, the heterogeneity of participants, and difficulties with recruiting appropriate control groups. A comprehensive battery of 'executive' tests was administered to 22 individuals with Asperger syndrome and 22 well-matched controls. Performance was analysed both between groups and on an individual basis to identify outliers in both the ASD and control groups. There were no differences between the groups on all 'classical' tests of executive function. However, differences were found on newer tests of executive function. Specifically, deficits in planning, abstract problem solving and especially multitasking. On the tests that discriminated the groups, all of the ASD individuals except one were identified as significantly impaired (i.e. below the 5th percentile of the control mean) on at least one executive measure. This study provides evidence for significant executive dysfunction in Asperger syndrome. Greatest dysfunction appeared in response initiation and intentionality at the highest level--the ability to engage and disengage actions in the service of overarching goals. These deficits are best observed through using more recent, ecologically valid tests of executive dysfunction. Moreover, performance on these measures correlated with autistic symptomatology.
16927399		Diagnosing Aspergers syndrome in the elderly: a series of case presentations.	International journal of geriatric psychiatry	2006	Ian Andrew James, Elizabeta Mukaetova-Ladinska, F Katharina Reichelt, Ruth Briel, Ann Scully		There are over 200,000 people in the UK diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome (AS). Most of these are children and young adults, owing to the fact the disorder was established relatively recently. It can be argued, therefore, that there are many older adults who may have met the criteria for AS as children, but never received such a diagnosis due to the fact it had yet to be established. What happended to these people as they aged?
16927012		Response times of children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome on an 'advanced' test of theory of mind.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Nils Kaland, Lars Smith, Erik Lykke Mortensen		In the present study the response times of 10- to 20-year-old participants with Asperger syndrome (AS) (N=21) of normal intelligence and a control group of typically developing individuals (N=20) were recorded on a new 'advanced' test of theory of mind. This test taps the ability to make mental-state inferences versus physical-state inferences in a story context. The participants with AS were significantly slower than the controls on both tasks. In addition, the differences in response times between mental- and physical-state inference were significantly larger in the AS group than in the control group, suggesting that the clinical group experienced more problems than the controls in making inferences about mental states than about physical states.

16913963		Two terms--one meaning: the conundrum of contemporary nomenclature in autism.	Journal of child and adolescent psychiatric nursing : official publication of the Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Nurses, Inc	2006	Andrew Cashin, Dip App Sci		Autism as a diagnostic construct in the last decade has undergone a process of rapid evolution in the way that it is operationalized. A by-product of the important conceptual shift is that we have been left with two terms, autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder, that point to the same thing. The existence of two terms that cannot be clearly delineated results in confusion and an added element in an already anxiety-laden mix for all those trying to come to terms with the concept of autism.
16913517		The prevalence and causes of autistic spectrum disorders.	Nursing times		Terry Hainsworth		Autism and autistic spectrum disorders are still relatively poorly understood.

16910535		[Attempted suicide of youth with Asperger's disorder].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2006	Katsunaka Mikami, Akitoshi Ohya, Kuni Akasaka, Hideo Matsumoto		"Research of Asperger's disorder is increasing through strong interest in this disorder. However, there are few reports on suicide attempts among youths with this disorder. We examined the clinical characteristics of serious suicide attempts of adolescents, and indicated the frequency of pervasive developmental disorders among them. In the present study, we reported a suicide attempt using briquettes by a youth with Asperger's disorder aged 23, who had a history of two suicide attempts by hanging. In this case, we examined the predisposing factors to suicide and possible intervention to prevent a re-attempt. As a result, in this case, we suggested that low self-esteem due to repeated serious social failures and feelings of isolation, although there was a social support system, were psycho-social predisposing factors. Moreover, the ""conflict"" between the patient and his parents, who should have provided social support for him, had made him feel alone. This ""conflict"" was composed of 1) the primary symptoms of Asperger's disorder (deficit of emotional reciprocity and unreasonable insistence on restricted thoughts.) and 2) his parents' insufficient comprehension of Asperger's disorder. This ""conflict"" was distinct from the conflict of interpersonal friction based on emotional interaction. In order to prevent a suicide re-attempt, we mainly intervened in the problem of low self-esteem due to repeated serious social failures and having feelings of isolation. We concluded that to prevent a suicide re-attempt in patients with Asperger's disorder, it is important to diagnose and treat the disorder and comorbidity, and it is more important to recognize and aggressively intervene in psycho-social predisposing factors."

16908483		The Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST): test-retest reliability.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Jo Williams, Carrie Allison, Fiona Scott, Carol Stott, Patrick Bolton, Simon Baron-Cohen, Carol Brayne		The Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST) is a 37-item parental self-completion questionnaire to screen for autism spectrum conditions in research. Good test accuracy was demonstrated in studies with primary school aged children in mainstream schools. The aim of this study was to investigate the test-retest reliability of the CAST. Parents of 1000 children in years 1-6 in five mainstream primary schools in Cambridgeshire received the CAST. A second identical questionnaire was posted to respondents after approximately 2 weeks. Both mailings generated 136 responses. Agreement above and below a screening cut-point of 15 was investigated. The kappa statistic for agreement (< 15 versus > or = 15) was 0.70, and 97 percent (95 percent CI: 93-99 percent) of children did not move across the cut-point of 15. The correlation between the two test scores was 0.83 (Spearman's rho). The CAST has shown good test-retest reliability, and now requires further investigation in a high-scoring sample.
16908482		The quality of life of young men with Asperger syndrome: a brief report.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Marieke Jennes-Coussens, Joyce Magill-Evans, Cyndie Koning		Factors influencing quality of life for persons with Asperger syndrome are not yet understood. Men, ages 18 to 21, completed the World Health Organization Quality Of Life measure, the Perceived Support Network Inventory, and a semi-structured interview. Asperger syndrome affects quality of life beyond the obvious social impact. The 12 men with Asperger syndrome reported a significantly lower social and physical quality of life than did the 13 men in the control group. Education, living arrangements, and number of friends were remarkably similar between groups. Those with Asperger syndrome had less positive employment experiences and showed more preference for solitary activities. Interventions need to be based on a holistic model.
16908481		Social attribution processes and comorbid psychiatric symptoms in children with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Jessica A Meyer, Peter C Mundy, Amy Vaughan Van Hecke, Jennifer Stella Durocher		The factors that place children with Asperger syndrome at risk for comorbid psychiatric symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, remain poorly understood. We investigated the possibility that the children's emotional and behavioral difficulties are associated with social information and attribution processing. Participants were children with either Asperger syndrome (n = 31) or typical development (n = 33).To assess social information and attribution processing, children responded to hypothetical social vignettes. They also completed self-report measures of social difficulties and psychological functioning. Their parents provided information on social competence and clinical presentation. Children with Asperger syndrome showed poor psychosocial adjustment, which was related to their social information and attribution processing patterns. Cognitive and social-cognitive abilities were associated with aspects of social information processing tendencies, but not with emotional and behavioral difficulties. Results suggest that the comorbid symptoms of children with Asperger syndrome may be associated with their social perception, understanding, and experience.
16908480		Theory of mind and central coherence in adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Renae Beaumont, Peter Newcombe		The study investigated theory of mind and central coherence abilities in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) or Asperger syndrome (AS) using naturalistic tasks. Twenty adults with HFA/AS correctly answered significantly fewer theory of mind questions than 20 controls on a forced-choice response task. On a narrative task, there were no differences in the proportion of mental state words between the two groups, although the participants with HFA/AS were less inclined to provide explanations for characters' mental states. No between-group differences existed on the central coherence questions of the forced-choice response task, and the participants with HFA/AS included an equivalent proportion of explanations for non-mental state phenomena in their narratives as did controls. These results support the theory of mind deficit account of autism spectrum disorders, and suggest that difficulties in mental state attribution cannot be exclusively attributed to weak central coherence.
16906462		Who cares? Revisiting empathy in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Kimberley Rogers, Isabel Dziobek, Jason Hassenstab, Oliver T Wolf, Antonio Convit		A deficit in empathy has consistently been cited as a central characteristic of Asperger syndrome (AS), but previous research on adults has predominantly focused on cognitive empathy, effectively ignoring the role of affective empathy. We administered the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), a multi-dimensional measure of empathy, and the Strange Stories test to 21 adults with AS and 21 matched controls. Our data show that while the AS group scored lower on the measures of cognitive empathy and theory of mind, they were no different from controls on one affective empathy scale of the IRI (empathic concern), and scored higher than controls on the other (personal distress). Therefore, we propose that the issue of empathy in AS should be revisited.

Biological psychiatry	2007	Eric Hollander, Jennifer Bartz, William Chaplin, Ann Phillips, Jennifer Sumner, Latha Soorya, Evdokia Anagnostou, Stacey Wasserman		Oxytocin dysfunction might contribute to the development of social deficits in autism, a core symptom domain and potential target for intervention. This study explored the effect of intravenous oxytocin administration on the retention of social information in autism.
16903124		Developmental dyspraxia is not limited to imitation in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS	2006	Stewart H Mostofsky, Prachi Dubey, Vandna K Jerath, Eva M Jansiewicz, Melissa C Goldberg, Martha B Denckla		Impaired imitation of skilled gestures is commonly reported in autism. Questions, however, remain as to whether impaired imitation is associated with a more generalized deficit in performance of gestures consistent with a dyspraxia and whether the pattern of errors differs from that observed in typically developing children. To address these questions, praxis in 21 high-functioning children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) was compared with 24 typically developing controls using a traditional approach in which performance was evaluated through detailed examination of error types. Children with ASD produced significantly fewer correct responses not only during Gesture to Imitation, but also during Gesture to Command and with Tool Use. The pattern of errors in ASD was similar to that of controls with spatial errors being most common in both groups; however, body-part-for-tool errors were more common in children with ASD, suggesting dyspraxia is not entirely attributable to motor deficits. The findings suggest that autism is associated with a generalized praxis deficit, rather than a deficit specific to imitation. In a developmental disorder such as autism, the findings may reflect abnormalities in frontal/parietal-subcortical circuits important for acquisition (i.e., learning) of sensory representations of movement and/or the motor sequence programs necessary to execute them.
16900937		Can Asperger syndrome be diagnosed at 26 months old? A genetic high-risk single-case study.	Journal of child neurology	2006	Simon Baron-Cohen, Fiona Scott, Sally Wheelwright, Mark Johnson, Dheraj Bisarya, Atman Desai, Jag Ahluwalia		Asperger syndrome, a heritable condition entailing empathy deficits together with unusually narrow interests in individuals of normal or even above-average intelligence, was recognized only recently. Here we report the first-ever prospective study of a child born to two adults with a formal diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. The child's parents are both scientists (a mathematician and a chemist). The aim of study 1 was to test if the child also developed Asperger syndrome, given the heritability of the condition, and if Asperger syndrome can be detected at 26 months. At 18 months, the child was given the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers, and at 26 months, she was assessed diagnostically for autism spectrum conditions using the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised and the Autism Diagnostic Observational Scale. The child failed the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers at 18 months and met the criteria for Asperger syndrome at 26 months. This single case is consistent with the hypersystemizing, assortative mating theory of autism. This theory requires further testing with large samples. This study also demonstrates that Asperger syndrome can be diagnosed by age 26 months. The aim of study 2 was to test if dyadic eye contact in infancy is intact in a child later diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. The same child's eye contact was measured at three time points (3, 6, and 9 months) over her first year of life and compared with that of age-matched controls. Although the child had low rates of eye contact at 6 months, it was within the normal range at all three points in the first year of life. We conclude that low levels of eye contact are not predictive of later development of Asperger syndrome.
16900403		Using virtual environments for teaching social understanding to 6 adolescents with autistic spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Peter Mitchell, Sarah Parsons, Anne Leonard		Six teenagers with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) experienced a Virtual Environment (VE) of a café. They also watched three sets of videos of real cafés and buses and judged where they would sit and explained why. Half of the participants received their VE experience between the first and second sets of videos, and half experienced it between the second and third. Ten naïve raters independently coded participants' judgments and reasoning. In direct relation to the timing of VE use, there were several instances of significant improvement in judgments and explanations about where to sit, both in a video of a café and a bus. The results demonstrate the potential of Virtual Reality for teaching social skills.
16897404		Residual language deficits in optimal outcome children with a history of autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Elizabeth Kelley, Jennifer J Paul, Deborah Fein, Letitia R Naigles		This study examined whether language deficits persist even in children with optimal outcomes. We examined a group of children with prior diagnoses on the autism spectrum who had IQs in the normal range, were in age-appropriate mainstream classes, and had improved to such an extent that they were considered to be functioning at the level of their typically developing peers. Fourteen such children between the ages of five and nine were matched on age and sex with typically developing children, and were given a battery of 10 language tests to investigate their language abilities. Results indicated that while these children's grammatical capabilities are mostly indistinguishable from their peers, they are still experiencing difficulties in pragmatic and semantic language.
16897402		Lexical knowledge and lexical use in autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Michael R Perkins, Sushie Dobbinson, Jill Boucher, Simone Bol, Paul Bloom		One aspect of autistic language that has been infrequently researched is vocabulary and the conceptual knowledge underpinning individual words or word types. In this descriptive study we investigate anomalous vocabulary use in a 70,000-word corpus of conversational autistic language and examine evidence that concept formation, and hence vocabulary, is abnormal in autism. Particular attention is paid to the expression of artifact and temporal concepts which some believe may develop abnormally in autism. Little evidence is found of anomalous use of artifact terms, though errors with temporal (and also spatial) expressions are relatively common. We discuss why this may be and consider several potential explanations for why underlying lexical knowledge in autism may not necessarily be reflected in lexical use.
16897391		Fragmented visuospatial processing in children with pervasive developmental disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Wim A J M Schlooz, Wouter Hulstijn, Pieter J A van den Broek, Angela C A M van der Pijll, Fons Gabreëls, Rutger J van der Gaag, Jan J Rotteveel		Children diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger Syndrome (AS) may be characterised by a similar perceptual focus on details as children with autistic disorder (AD). This was tested by analysing their performance in a visuoperceptual task [the Children's Embedded Figure Test (CEFT)] and a graphic reproduction task [the Rey Complex Figure Task (Rey CFT)]. Control groups were children with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and typically developing children. The TS sample performed similarly to the normal control group in both tasks. The CEFT results did not show the expected preference for local processing in children with PDD-NOS. However, the Rey CFT data revealed that the children with this lesser variant of PDD processed visuospatial information in a fragmented way and were deficient in global processing.
16897388		Verbal marking of affect by children with Asperger Syndrome and high functioning autism during spontaneous interactions with family members.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Eve Müller, Adriana Schuler		Verbal marking of affect by older children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA) during spontaneous interactions is described. Discourse analysis of AS and HFA and typically developing children included frequency of affective utterances, affective initiations, affective labels and affective explanations, attribution of affective responses to self and others, and positive and negative markers of affect. Findings indicate that children with AS and HFA engaged in a higher proportion of affect marking and provided a higher proportion of affective explanations than typically developing children, yet were less likely to initiate affect marking sequences or talk about the affective responses of others. No significant differences were found between groups in terms of the marking of positive and negative affect.
16897386		Rules versus prototype matching: strategies of perception of emotional facial expressions in the autism spectrum.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	M D Rutherford, Daniel N McIntosh		When perceiving emotional facial expressions, people with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) appear to focus on individual facial features rather than configurations. This paper tests whether individuals with ASD use these features in a rule-based strategy of emotional perception, rather than a typical, template-based strategy by considering outcome implications of these strategies. Rule-based strategies are more tolerant of extreme stimuli than are template-based ones. Tolerance for exaggerated emotional facial expressions in individuals with ASD compared to IQ and education matched controls was tested in a forced-choice paradigm. For five of six emotions, those with ASD were more likely to accept the most exaggerated images as most realistic. People with ASD appear to rely more heavily on a rule-based strategy than a template-based strategy in perceiving emotional facial expressions.
16897379		Short breaks services for children with autistic spectrum disorders: factors associated with service use and non-use.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	David Preece, Rita Jordan		Short break services in a UK county were studied using a postal survey of 256 families with a child with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Results confirmed high degrees of stress and low levels of informal support for all families, but no significant difference in the informal support available to non-users as compared to users of short break services. Robinson & Stalker's (1990) 10-point dependency scale showed a significant difference in dependence and more difficult behaviors between children of users and non-users. However, a large number of non-users had children with high dependence (scoring >7 points). Access was denied by the age of the child (under 11) diagnosis (Asperger syndrome), educational placement (mainstream) and lack of social worker referral.

Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology	2006	T Lepistö, S Silokallio, T Nieminen-von Wendt, P Alku, R Näätänen, T Kujala		Language development is delayed and deviant in individuals with autism, but proceeds quite normally in those with Asperger syndrome (AS). We investigated auditory-discrimination and orienting in children with AS using an event-related potential (ERP) paradigm that was previously applied to children with autism.

16874561		Autobiographical memory and social problem-solving in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Lorna Goddard, Patricia Howlin, Barbara Dritschel, Trishna Patel		Difficulties in social interaction are a central feature of Asperger syndrome. Effective social interaction involves the ability to solve interpersonal problems as and when they occur. Here we examined social problem-solving in a group of adults with Asperger syndrome and control group matched for age, gender and IQ. We also assessed autobiographical memory, on a cueing task and during social problem-solving, and examined the relationship between access to specific past experiences and social problem-solving ability. Results demonstrated a social problem-solving impairment in the Asperger group. Their solutions were less detailed, less effective and less extended in time. Autobiographical memory performance was also impaired with significantly longer latencies to retrieve specific memories and fewer specific memories retrieved in comparison to controls.
16874560		Deficits in free recall persist in Asperger's syndrome despite training in the use of list-appropriate learning strategies.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Brenda J Smith, John M Gardiner, Dermot M Bowler		Free recall in adults with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) was compared with that in matched controls in an experiment including semantically similar, phonologically similar and unrelated word lists. Without supportive instructions, adults with AS were significantly impaired in their recall of phonologically and semantically related lists, but not unrelated lists. Even when trained to make use at study of the relations among the words, the adults with AS recalled fewer words than the control group. Participants rehearsed the study lists out loud and the rehearsal data was analysed. Despite a very slight trend for adults with AS to engage in less elaborative rehearsal and more rote rehearsal, their rehearsal did not differ significantly from that of controls.
16868849		Brief report: identical male twins concordant for Asperger's disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Michiko Ishijima, Hiroshi Kurita		The first case study of identical male twins concordant for DSM-IV Asperger's disorder (ASD) was presented. Their monozygocity was confirmed by short tandem repeat analyses with a probability of 99.999963%. Despite sharing the same DNA and environment, the twins are different in comorbidity (i.e., major depressive disorder in the elder and absence seizure in the younger) and in IQs and motor performance (i.e., the elder was lower in IQs and clumsier). Both of them were normal in computed tomographic scanning and magnetic resonance imaging discordant with some previous reports of brain imaging abnormalities in ASD. Further studies are needed to clarify inherited/acquired epigenetic defects and brain imaging abnormalities relating to behavioral phenotypes in ASD twins.
16865551		An examination of movement kinematics in young people with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder: further evidence for a motor planning deficit.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Nicole J Rinehart, Mark A Bellgrove, Bruce J Tonge, Avril V Brereton, Debra Howells-Rankin, John L Bradshaw		"This paper examines upper-body movement kinematics in individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger's disorder (AD). In general, the results indicate that HFA is more consistently associated with impaired motoric preparation/initiation than AD. The data further suggest that this quantitative difference in motor impairment is not necessarily underpinned by greater executive dysfunction vulnerability in autism relative to AD. Quantitative motoric dissociation between autism and AD may have down-stream effects on later stages of movement resulting in qualitative differences between these disorder groups, e.g. ""motor clumsiness"" in AD versus ""abnormal posturing"" in autism. It will be important for future research to map the developmental trajectory of motor abnormalities in these disorder groups."
16865549		Social skills and problem behaviours in school aged children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's Disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Kathleen Macintosh, Cheryl Dissanayake		The social skills and problem behaviours of children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's Disorder were compared using parent and teacher reports on the Social Skills Rating System. The participants were 20 children with high-functioning autism, 19 children with Asperger's Disorder, and 17 typically developing children, matched on chronological and overall mental age. The children with autism and Asperger's Disorder were not differentiated on any social skill or problem behaviour based either on teacher or parent report. However, both clinical groups demonstrated significant social skill deficits and problem behaviours relative to the typically developing children, and the original standardization sample. The findings were compatible with the view that autism and Asperger's Disorder belong on a single spectrum of disorder.
16865545		An electrophysiological investigation of semantic incongruity processing by people with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Howard Ring, Simeran Sharma, Sally Wheelwright, Geoff Barrett		The aim of this study was to investigate whether a physiological measure of impaired use of context could be obtained in people with Asperger's Syndrome (AS). The experimental paradigm employed was the use of electroencephalography to measure the detection of semantic incongruity within written sentences, as indexed by an N400 event-related potential. Whilst the seven controls appropriately demonstrated N400 potentials only to semantically incongruent stimuli, the seven participants with AS inappropriately demonstrated N400 potentials to congruent stimuli. These results are compatible with the possibility that the participants with AS did not use the context within sentences to predict the final word of the sentences.
16856784		Case illustration of a boy with nonverbal learning disorder and Asperger's features: neuropsychological and personality assessment.	Journal of personality assessment	2006	Jed Yalof	Department of Graduate Psychology, Immaculata University, USA.	I present a case study of a latency-age boy referred for assessment of a nonverbal learning disability/disorder (NLD) who also had features of Asperger's syndrome (AS). I review NLD terminology, presumed brain-behavior relationship, neuropsychological profile, and diagnosis/classification issues. I discuss the challenge of differentiating NLD from AS in relation to the client's pattern of visual-spatial, communication, social-emotional, and behavioral NLD correlates. I integrate neuropsychological and personality assessment data with interviews, observations, prior testing, and input from teacher and therapist in formulating a diagnostic impression. I discuss Rorschach (Exner, 2003) and neuropsychological consultations in relation to subtle language and interpersonal features of the client's communication style. I provide parent feedback at 18 and 24 months posttesting. I discuss implications relative to a model of school neuropsychological assessment that includes the Rorschach test.

Deutsche tierarztliche Wochenschrift	2006	M Asperger, J Thielebein, C Weisbrich, K Eulenberger		The following parameters were determined in blood serum of apparently healthy Bennett's wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus) using the Hitachi 917 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and/or the Vettest 8008 (IDEXX-GmbH, Woerrstadt, Germany): alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, ammonia, alpha-amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, Ca, Cl, cholesterol, cholinesterase, creatine kinase, creatinine, gammaglutamyltransferase, glucose, iron, lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, phosphate, potassium, protein, sodium, total bilirubin, triglyceride, and urea. The results for cholesterol, glucose, total protein, triglyceride and for the enzymes alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and lactate dehydrogenase differed significantly between both methods (P < 0.05). There is a negative correlation between the age of the Bennett's wallabies and the activity of the alkaline phosphatase. Five protein fractions could be separated on cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The mean concentrations of fructosamine and beta-hydroxybutyrate were 447.3 micromol/L and 0.27 mmol/L, respectively. The estimated vitamin A intake had no influence on the vitamin A concentration in serum. The serum vitamin E concentration was in general low and vitamin E was below the detection limit of 0.82 micromol/L in 29 out of 42 serum samples. The use of these analytes is discussed concerning the knowledge about the physiology, nutrition and diseases of macropods.
16855874		Involvement or isolation? The social networks of children with autism in regular classrooms.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2007	Brandt Chamberlain, Connie Kasari, Erin Rotheram-Fuller		Including children with autism in regular classrooms has become prevalent; yet some evidence suggests such placements could increase the risk of isolation and rejection. In this study, we used social network methods to explore the involvement of children with autism in typical classrooms. Participants were 398 children (196 boys) in regular 2nd through 5th grade classes, including 17 children (14 boys) with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. Children reported on friendship qualities, peer acceptance, loneliness, and classroom social networks. Despite involvement in networks, children with autism experienced lower centrality, acceptance, companionship, and reciprocity; yet they did not report greater loneliness. Future research is needed to help children with autism move from the periphery to more effective engagement with peers.
16840925		[A case of pervasive developmental disorder with chromosomal translocation (X; 4) (p11; q13)].	L'Encephale	2006	A Azzoni, M Raja		Chromosomal aberrations, with or without congenital physical abnormalities, have been frequently found associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, including mental retardation, psychosis, autism, and criminal behaviour. The meaning of the association frequently remains unclear. However, consistent findings of association between specific chromosomal abnormalities and clinical phenotype may provide evidence of a causal relationship and shed light on the pathogenesis of obscure disorders.
16837166		Benign partial epilepsy in infancy long-term outcome and marginal syndromes.	Epilepsy research	2006	Akihisa Okumura, Kazuyoshi Watanabe, Tamiko Negoro		Benign partial epilepsy in infancy (BPEI) is an infantile epilepsy with excellent seizure and developmental outcome proposed by Watanabe et al. Our telephone interview survey revealed that the long-term outcome of patients with BPEI was also excellent over 8 years of age. Six of 39 patients did not fulfill the criteria of BPEI by the last follow-up. Two patients had a recurrence of unprovoked seizure beyond 2 years of age, three had cognitive problems (mild mental retardation in two and Asperger syndrome in one) and the other had both a recurrence of seizure and mild mental retardation. These results indicates that a large majority of patients diagnosed as possible BPEI at 2 years of age did not have a recurrence of unprovoked seizures and mental problems beyond 8 years of age. Our study also suggested a presence of some marginal syndromes of BPEI. An association of paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis was observed in three patients. Another three patients had experienced seizures with mild gastroenteritis. The seizure outcome of three patients with mild cognitive problems was quite excellent. These patients can be grouped as a marginal syndrome of BPEI.

The authors used imaging studies to map volumetric and metabolic differences within the entire dorsoventral extent of the striatum and thalamus.
16806312		Differential activation of the amygdala and the 'social brain' during fearful face-processing in Asperger Syndrome.	Neuropsychologia	2007	Chris Ashwin, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright, Michelle O'Riordan, Edward T Bullmore		Impaired social cognition is a core feature of autism. There is much evidence showing people with autism use a different cognitive style than controls for face-processing. We tested if people with autism would show differential activation of social brain areas during a face-processing task. Thirteen adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger Syndrome (HFA/AS) and 13 matched controls. We used fMRI to investigate 'social brain' activity during perception of fearful faces. We employed stimuli known to reliably activate the amygdala and other social brain areas, and ROI analyses to investigate brain areas responding to facial threat as well as those showing a linear response to varying threat intensities. We predicted: (1) the HFA/AS group would show differential activation (as opposed to merely deficits) of the social brain compared to controls and (2) that social brain areas would respond to varied intensity of fear in the control group, but not the HFA/AS group. Both predictions were confirmed. The controls showed greater activation in the left amygdala and left orbito-frontal cortex, while the HFA/AS group showed greater activation in the anterior cingulate gyrus and superior temporal cortex. The control group also showed varying responses in social brain areas to varying intensities of fearful expression, including differential activations in the left and right amygdala. This response in the social brain was absent in the HFA/AS group. HFA/AS are associated with different patterns of activation of social brain areas during fearful emotion processing, and the absence in the HFA/AS brain of a response to varying emotional intensity.

16794786		The neuroligin and neurexin families: from structure to function at the synapse.	Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS	2006	M-F Lisé, A El-Husseini		Proper brain connectivity and neuronal transmission rely on the accurate assembly of neurotransmitter receptors, cell adhesion molecules and several other scaffolding and signaling proteins at synapses. Several new exciting findings point to an important role for the neuroligin family of adhesion molecules in synapse development and function. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the structure of neuroligins and neurexins, their potential binding partners at the synapse. We also discuss their potential involvement in several aspects of synapse development, including induction, specificity and stabilization. The implication of neuroligins in cognitive disorders such as autism and mental retardation is also discussed.
16791390		[Autism and Asperger syndrome: an overview].	Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)	2006	Ami Klin	Yale Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.	Autism and Asperger syndrome are diagnostic entities in a family of neurodevelopmental disorders disrupting fundamental processes of socialization, communication and learning, collectively known as pervasive developmental disorders. This group of conditions is among the most common developmental disorders, affecting 1 in every 200 or so individuals. They are also the most strongly genetically related among developmental disorders, with recurrence risks within sibships of the order of 2 to 15% if a broader definition of affectedness is adopted. Their early onset, symptom profile, and chronicity implicate fundamental biological mechanisms involved in social adaptation. Advances in their understanding are leading to a new social neuroscience perspective of normative socialization processes and specific disruptions thereof. These processes may lead to the emergence of the highly heterogeneous phenotypes associated with autism, the paradigmatic pervasive developmental disorder, and its variants. This overview focuses on the history, nosology, and the clinical and associated features of the two most well-known pervasive developmental disorders - autism and Asperger syndrome.

In this review, Rett's syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, which are well-defined categories, will be discussed, as well as the not well defined categories that have been included in the Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified group. Different proposals of categorization have been created, some of which based on descriptive phenomenological approach, and others based upon other theoretical perspectives, such as neuropsychology. Current proposals are presented and discussed, followed by critical appraisals on the clinical advantages and disadvantages of these concepts."

16782144		Porphyrinuria in childhood autistic disorder: implications for environmental toxicity.	Toxicology and applied pharmacology	2006	Robert Nataf, Corinne Skorupka, Lorene Amet, Alain Lam, Anthea Springbett, Richard Lathe		To address a possible environmental contribution to autism, we carried out a retrospective study on urinary porphyrin levels, a biomarker of environmental toxicity, in 269 children with neurodevelopmental and related disorders referred to a Paris clinic (2002-2004), including 106 with autistic disorder. Urinary porphyrin levels determined by high-performance liquid chromatography were compared between diagnostic groups including internal and external control groups. Coproporphyrin levels were elevated in children with autistic disorder relative to control groups. Elevation was maintained on normalization for age or to a control heme pathway metabolite (uroporphyrin) in the same samples. The elevation was significant (P < 0.001). Porphyrin levels were unchanged in Asperger's disorder, distinguishing it from autistic disorder. The atypical molecule precoproporphyrin, a specific indicator of heavy metal toxicity, was also elevated in autistic disorder (P < 0.001) but not significantly in Asperger's. A subgroup with autistic disorder was treated with oral dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) with a view to heavy metal removal. Following DMSA there was a significant (P = 0.002) drop in urinary porphyrin excretion. These data implicate environmental toxicity in childhood autistic disorder.
16776442		Experiences of parenting young people with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome: a focus group study.	The international journal of psychiatric nursing research	2006	Neil Chell	Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS Trust, Clarendon House, Station Road, Kettering, Northants.	Asperger syndrome only became recognised as a distinct diagnostic category in more recent versions of ICD 10 (WHO 1992) and DSM IV (APA 1994). Whilst a great deal of work has taken place since this time, there has been little research directed at understanding the experiences of families raising children with this diagnosis (Blacher 2003). This focus group study involved engaging directly with parents of children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome in order to understand something of their experiences with particular reference to what has or might be helpful. The aim of the study is to identify parent's perspectives and insights in order to inform service development.
16770915		Developmentally impaired boys coming of age.	American journal of psychotherapy	2006	Owen Lewis	College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, USA. owenlewismd@aol.com	Psychotherapy for children with significant developmental impairments often focuses on specific, symptom-targeted treatments. While often effective, these treatments do not address the impaired view these children have of themselves. Adolescence and the struggles to come to terms with sexuality, present a unique opportunity for the psychodynamically oriented therapist to confirm what is normal and expand domains of relatedness. The cases of three boys are described in which the therapy played a vital role in normalizing their adolescent experiences. These boys carried diagnoses of Asperger's Syndrome, Aspergers's with Bipolar Disorder, and Multi-dimensionally Impaired. With more of a sense of normalcy about their drives, as well as the pressure of the drives themselves, these boys were able to establish both sexual and friendship relationships beyond expectations.
16761693		[Characteristics of juvenile court cases with pervasive developmental disorder].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2006	Takashi Kumagami	Tokyo family court.	Forty-eight juvenile delinquency cases, who were sent to a family court between April, 2002 and March, 2005, and diagnosed with Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), were examined regarding the following characteristics: (1) demographic, cognitive and social profiles (sex, age, intellectual development, school register), (2) diagnostic subclasses of PDD, and (3) types (classification), causes, and backgrounds of delinquency. While the PDD group revealed no noticeable differences in the distributions of sex, age, school register status, and intellectual abilities, compared with a general delinquent juvenile population, the PDD group showed a much higher rate of sexual offences and antisocial behaviors based on the confusion due to limited interpersonal abilities. Forty-two (87.5%) were diagnosed with Asperger's disorder, with an IQ within the normal range. In more than half of the cases, offensive conducts occurred in their inappropriate a Hemprs to approach others, caused by the underdevelopment of social abilities. In other cases, the primary handicap and associated symptoms of PDD, as well as the obsessive pursuit of a scientific/experimental interest, played some role in the development of delinquency. In dealing with delinquent cases of juveniles with PDD, it seems very important to keep in mind the characteristics of PDD, and cooperate with professionals and organizations of other fields related to juvenile mental health, such as child psychiatrists, social welfare facilities, and institutions of the Ministry of Justice (juvenile detention home, juvenile training school, and probationary office).

16755384		Social Stories for children with disabilities.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Georgina Reynhout, Mark Carter		A review of the empirical research literature on Social Stories is presented, including a descriptive review and single-subject meta-analysis of appropriate studies. Examination of data suggests the effects of Social Stories are highly variable. Interpretations of extant studies are frequently confounded by inadequate participant description and the use of Social Stories in combination with other interventions. It is unclear whether particular components of Social Stories are central to their efficacy. Data on maintenance and generalization are also limited. Social Stories stand as a promising intervention, being relatively straightforward and efficient to implement with application to a wide range of behaviors. Further research is needed to determine the exact nature of their contribution and the components critical to their efficacy.
16755332		Introducing MASC: a movie for the assessment of social cognition.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Isabel Dziobek, Stefan Fleck, Elke Kalbe, Kimberley Rogers, Jason Hassenstab, Matthias Brand, Josef Kessler, Jan K Woike, Oliver T Wolf, Antonio Convit		In the present study we introduce a sensitive video-based test for the evaluation of subtle mindreading difficulties: the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC). This new mindreading tool involves watching a short film and answering questions referring to the actors' mental states. A group of adults with Asperger syndrome (n = 19) and well-matched control subjects (n = 20) were administered the MASC and three other mindreading tools as part of a broader neuropsychological testing session. Compared to control subjects, Asperger individuals exhibited marked and selective difficulties in social cognition. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis for the mindreading tests identified the MASC as discriminating the diagnostic groups most accurately. Issues pertaining to the multidimensionality of the social cognition construct are discussed.

16732747		Discrepancy of performance among working memory-related tasks in autism spectrum disorders was caused by task characteristics, apart from working memory, which could interfere with task execution.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2006	Takayuki Nakahachi, Masao Iwase, Hidetoshi Takahashi, Eiko Honaga, Ryuji Sekiyama, Satoshi Ukai, Ryouhei Ishii, Wataru Ishigami, Osami Kajimoto, Ko Yamashita, Ryota Hashimoto, Hisashi Tanii, Akira Shimizu, Masatoshi Takeda		Working memory performance has been inconsistently reported in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Several studies in ASD have found normal performance in digit span and poor performance in digit symbol task although these are closely related with working memory. It is assumed that poor performance in digit symbol could be explained by confirmatory behavior, which is induced due to the vague memory representation of number-symbol association. Therefore it was hypothesized that the performance of working memory task, in which vagueness did not cause confirmatory behavior, would be normal in ASD. For this purpose, the Advanced Trail Making Test (ATMT) was used. The performance of digit span, digit symbol and ATMT was compared between ASD and normal control. The digit span, digit symbol and ATMT was given to 16 ASD subjects and 28 IQ-, age- and sex-matched control subjects. The scores of these tasks were compared. A significantly lower score for ASD was found only in digit symbol compared with control subjects. There were no significant difference in digit span and working memory estimated by ATMT. Discrepancy of scores among working memory-related tasks was demonstrated in ASD. Poor digit symbol performance, normal digit span and normal working memory in ATMT implied that ASD subjects would be intact in working memory itself, and that superficial working memory dysfunction might be observed due to confirmatory behavior in digit symbol. Therefore, to evaluate working memory in ASD, tasks that could stimulate psychopathology specific to ASD should be avoided.

The condition is probably not homogenous. Elevated urine peptides have been found in individuals affected by autism spectrum disorders. This finding may be explained by characteristics of the samples studied. Autistic children without mental retardation (high-functioning autism) or mild mental retardation may represent a more homogenous group among those suffering from autism spectrum disorders. The purpose of this study is to compare urine peptide patterns in this group of patients with healthy controls. This has never been done before.

So 66 AS children, 20 HFA children and 37 AD/HD children were selected, compared the profiles of score on the MSST. The results showed that the inability to understand sarcastic situation was specific to group with AS, both group with HFA and AD/HD were differ little to understand between metaphor and sarcasm. In this study suggest differences in situational recognition among the PDD subtypes, the clinical symptoms of PDD reflects characteristics of AS.
16705653		N-terminal H3/D3-acetylation for improved high-throughput peptide sequencing by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with a time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyzer.	Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM	2006	Marek J Noga, Arndt Asperger, Jerzy Silberring		A novel method for peptide sequencing by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry with a time-of-flight/time-of-flight analyzer (MALDI-TOF/TOF) is presented. A stable isotope label introduced in the peptide N-terminus by derivatization, using a 1:1 mixture of acetic anhydride and deuterated acetic anhydride, allows for easy and unambiguous identification of ions belonging either to the N- or the C-terminal ion series in the product ion spectrum, making sequence assignment significantly simplified. The good performance of this technique was shown by successful sequencing of the contents of several peptide maps. A similar approach was recently applied to nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI) and nano-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The MALDI-TOF/TOF technique allows for fast, direct sequencing of modified peptides in proteomics samples, and is complementary to the nanoESI and nanoLC/MS/MS approaches.
16702548		Failing to deactivate: resting functional abnormalities in autism.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2006	Daniel P Kennedy, Elizabeth Redcay, Eric Courchesne		"Several regions of the brain (including medial prefrontal cortex, rostral anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate, and precuneus) are known to have high metabolic activity during rest, which is suppressed during cognitively demanding tasks. With functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this suppression of activity is observed as ""deactivations,"" which are thought to be indicative of an interruption of the mental activity that persists during rest. Thus, measuring deactivation provides a means by which rest-associated functional activity can be quantitatively examined. Applying this approach to autism, we found that the autism group failed to demonstrate this deactivation effect. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between a clinical measure of social impairment and functional activity within the ventral medial prefrontal cortex. We speculate that the lack of deactivation in the autism group is indicative of abnormal internally directed processes at rest, which may be an important contribution to the social and emotional deficits of autism."
16697288		Classification matters for catatonia and autism in children.	International review of neurobiology	2006	Klaus-Jürgen Neumärker	Charité, Humboldt-University Berlin, Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, DRK Hospital, Berlin-Westend, Berlin, Germany.	Despite its chequered history, Kahlbaum's 1874 description of catatonia (tension insanity) and its categorization as a clinical illness is in outline still valid. Kahlbaum also acknowledged the existence of catatonia in children. Corresponding case studies have also been analyzed. The originators and disciples of the Wernicke-Kleist-Leonhard school proved catatonia in early childhood as a discrete entity with specific psychopathology. This does not mean that catatonic symptoms do not occur in other illnesses and in particular in organic psychoses. These are, however, of a totally different nature. Autism, as first described in connection with schizophrenic negativism by Bleuler in 1910, is one of the key symptoms of schizophrenia. As identified by Kanner in 1943, abnormal social interaction and communication, together with retarded development, are the main characteristics of autism in early childhood. Asperger's concept of autistic disorder (1944), although based on psychopathological theory, did not include retardation in development as an aspect. Consequently, autistic behavior can occur in a variety of mental disorders. Research into possible etiological and pathogenetic factors has been undertaken, but no clear link found as yet.
16697263		Psychiatric comorbidity in adult patients with hypothalamic hamartoma.	Epilepsy & behavior : E&B	2006	Sherese Ali, John Moriarty, Nandini Mullatti, Anthony David		"The objective was to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity in adults with hypothalamic hamartoma (HH). A standardized clinical interview and assessment scales were used to assess for depression, anxiety, personality, and sexual behavior, based on previous findings in the pediatric population. We found a high prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders, with Major Depressive Disorder and Social Anxiety Disorder being the most common. ""Anxious"" personality types were the most common. Symptoms of Asperger syndrome were high in males versus females. We concluded that depression and anxiety are common in adult patients with HH. Remission of cognitive, behavioral, and autistic symptoms has been reported with surgical tumor resection. Whether this can correct the psychiatric disturbances remains to be investigated. The need for adjunctive psychiatric treatment may nevertheless remain."
16685182		Parental perceptions and use of complementary and alternative medicine practices for children with autistic spectrum disorders in private practice.	Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2006	John W Harrington, Lawrence Rosen, Ana Garnecho, Patricia A Patrick		The prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States is approximately 1 in 150 children. Many health care providers are unaware of parental beliefs and treatments, both medical and complementary, that parents use for their child with ASD. Understanding these beliefs and practices concerning diagnosis, cause, and utilization of medical and complementary care may help physicians provide better comprehensive care. Parents of children with ASD from 2 private practices-one in New York and one in New Jersey-were mailed a 6-page, self-administered survey. In addition to demographics and ASD type, the survey asked parents who diagnosed their child and if there was a perceived delay in that diagnosis; whether they believed there was any causal reason for their child's autism; what chronic symptoms, if any, their child experiences; and, if they had used any complementary and/or alternative therapies and at whose recommendation. Respondents included 77 of the 150 parents (51%) contacted. Most children were diagnosed by a neurologist and/or developmental pediatrician (54% and 47%, respectively). Average perceived delay in diagnosis was 18 months. Parents most frequently cited immunizations (54%), genetic predisposition (53%), and environmental exposure (38%) as a cause of their child's autism. Approximately half of children were reported as having at least one gastrointestinal, neurological, and/or allergic symptom; more than a third had immunological symptoms. Almost all parents (95%) indicated some use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies, with most of the self-reported referrals generated from a physician or nurse (44%). Systemic complaints, parental beliefs, and use of CAM practices warrant open discussion by all health care professionals who provide care to this population.
16684884		Tbx1 haploinsufficiency is linked to behavioral disorders in mice and humans: implications for 22q11 deletion syndrome.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2006	Richard Paylor, Beate Glaser, Annalisa Mupo, Paris Ataliotis, Corinne Spencer, Angela Sobotka, Chelsey Sparks, Chul-Hee Choi, John Oghalai, Sarah Curran, Kieran C Murphy, Stephen Monks, Nigel Williams, Michael C O'Donovan, Michael J Owen, Peter J Scambler, Elizabeth Lindsay		About 35% of patients with 22q11 deletion syndrome (22q11DS), which includes DiGeorge and velocardiofacial syndromes, develops psychiatric disorders, mainly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We previously reported that mice carrying a multigene deletion (Df1) that models 22q11DS have reduced prepulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral abnormality and schizophrenia endophenotype. Impaired PPI is associated with several psychiatric disorders, including those that occur in 22q11DS, and recently, reduced PPI was reported in children with 22q11DS. Here, we have mapped PPI deficits in a panel of mouse mutants that carry deletions that partially overlap with Df1 and have defined a PPI critical region encompassing four genes. We then used single-gene mutants to identify the causative genes. We show that PPI deficits in Df1/+ mice are caused by haploinsufficiency of two genes, Tbx1 and Gnb1l. Mutation of either gene is sufficient to cause reduced PPI. Tbx1 is a transcription factor, the mutation of which is sufficient to cause most of the physical features of 22q11DS, but the gene had not been previously associated with the behavioral/psychiatric phenotype. A likely role for Tbx1 haploinsufficiency in psychiatric disease is further suggested by the identification of a family in which the phenotypic features of 22q11DS, including psychiatric disorders, segregate with an inactivating mutation of TBX1. One family member has Asperger syndrome, an autistic spectrum disorder that is associated with reduced PPI. Thus, Tbx1 and Gnb1l are strong candidates for psychiatric disease in 22q11DS patients and candidate susceptibility genes for psychiatric disease in the wider population.
16682398		Can the Children's Communication Checklist differentiate autism spectrum subtypes?	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Sylvie Verté, Hilde M Geurts, Herbert Roeyers, Yves Rosseel, Jaap Oosterlaan, Joseph A Sergeant		The study explored whether children with high functioning autism (HFA), Asperger syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) can be differentiated on the Children's Communication Checklist (CCC). The study also investigated whether empirically derived autistic subgroups can be identified with a cluster analytic method based on the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. Fifty-seven children with HFA, 47 with AS, 31 with PDD-NOS, and a normal control group of 47 children between 6 and 13 years participated. Children with HFA, AS, and PDD-NOS showed pragmatic communication deficits in comparison to the controls. Little difference was found between the three subtypes with respect to their CCC profile. A three-cluster solution explained the data best. The HFA cluster showed most autism characteristics, followed by the combined HFA + AS cluster, and then the PDD-NOS cluster. The findings support the autism spectrum concept based on severity of symptom impairment rather than distinct categories.
16682102		Executive function deficits in autism spectrum disorders and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: examining profiles across domains and ages.	Brain and cognition	2006	Francesca Happé, Rhonda Booth, Rebecca Charlton, Claire Hughes		Deficits in 'executive function' (EF) are characteristic of several clinical disorders, most notably Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In this study, age- and IQ-matched groups with ASD, ADHD, or typical development (TD) were compared on a battery of EF tasks tapping three core domains: response selection/inhibition, flexibility, and planning/working memory. Relations between EF, age and everyday difficulties (rated by parents and teachers) were also examined. Both clinical groups showed significant EF impairments compared with TD peers. The ADHD group showed greater inhibitory problems on a Go-no-Go task, while the ASD group was significantly worse on response selection/monitoring in a cognitive estimates task. Age-related improvements were clearer in ASD and TD than in ADHD. At older (but not younger) ages, the ASD group outperformed the ADHD group, performing as well as the TD group on many EF measures. EF scores were related to specific aspects of communicative and social adaptation, and negatively correlated with hyperactivity in ASD and TD. Within the present groups, the overall findings suggested less severe and persistent EF deficits in ASD (including Asperger Syndrome) than in ADHD.
16675944		Mental health in the United States: parental report of diagnosed autism in children aged 4-17 years--United States, 2003-2004.	MMWR. Morbidity and mortality weekly report	2006			Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early onset of impairments in social interaction and communication and unusual, stereotyped behaviors. Autism (i.e., autistic disorder) often is classified with two related, although less severe, developmental disorders: Asperger disorder and pervasive developmental disorder--not otherwise specified. These three constitute the autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Diagnosis of ASDs is based exclusively on developmental pattern and behavioral observation. Two population-based studies conducted by CDC in selected U.S. locations reported ASD prevalence of 3.4 and 6.7 per 1,000 children, respectively. CDC also conducts two nationally representative surveys, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH), in which parents are asked whether their child ever received a diagnosis of autism. Because of similarities in methodology used by the two surveys, CDC analyzed 2003-2004 data from NHIS and data from the first-ever NSCH (collected during January 2003-July 2004) to 1) estimate the population-based prevalence of parental report of diagnosed autism in the United States and 2) assess parental reporting of child social, emotional, and behavioral strengths and difficulties and special-health care needs among children with and without reported autism. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the prevalence of parent-reported diagnosis of autism was 5.7 per 1,000 children in NHIS and 5.5 per 1,000 children in NSCH. Prevalence estimates in the two studies were similar across age, sex, and racial/ethnic populations. The consistency in estimates between the two surveys suggests high reliability for parental report of autism. These estimates suggest that, as of 2003-2004, autism had been diagnosed in at least 300,000 U.S. children aged 4-17 years. In addition, parental reports of autism were associated with reported social, emotional, and behavioral symptoms and specialized needs. Thus, these surveys might be useful to assess health, education, and social service needs of children with autism.
16652237		Physical activity patterns in youth with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Chien-Yu Pan, Georgia C Frey		The purpose of this study was to examine age-related physical activity patterns in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Thirty youth, aged 10-19 years, were divided into three groups: elementary (n=9), middle (n=9) and high (n=12) school. Participants wore an accelerometer and completed an activity questionnaire for seven consecutive days. The main findings were that (a) elementary youth are more active than the other groups, regardless type of day or time period, and (b) there are no consistent patterns in physical activity of youth with ASD according to day or time period. Findings emphasize that interventions for this population should address increasing extracurricular physical activity options during adolescence.
16648340		Cortical serotonin 5-HT2A receptor binding and social communication in adults with Asperger's syndrome: an in vivo SPECT study.	The American journal of psychiatry	2006	Declan G M Murphy, Eileen Daly, Nicole Schmitz, Fiona Toal, Keiran Murphy, Sarah Curran, Kjell Erlandsson, Jos Eersels, Robert Kerwin, Peter Ell, Michael Travis		The cause of autistic spectrum disorder (i.e., autism and Asperger's syndrome) is unknown. The serotonergic (5-HT) system may be especially implicated. However, cortical 5-HT2A receptor density in adults with the disorder has not been examined, to the authors' knowledge.
16646974		Insomnia in school-age children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	BMC psychiatry	2006	Hiie Allik, Jan-Olov Larsson, Hans Smedje		Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) are pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) in individuals of normal intelligence. Childhood AS/HFA is considered to be often associated with disturbed sleep, in particular with difficulties initiating and/or maintaining sleep (insomnia). However, studies about the topic are still scarce. The present study investigated childhood AS/HFA regarding a wide range of parent reported sleep-wake behaviour, with a particular focus on insomnia.

16639533		Decoding of emotion through facial expression, prosody and verbal content in children and adolescents with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Jennifer L Lindner, Lee A Rosén		This study examined differences in the ability to decode emotion through facial expression, prosody, and verbal content between 14 children with Asperger's Syndrome (AS) and 16 typically developing peers. The ability to decode emotion was measured by the Perception of Emotion Test (POET), which portrayed the emotions of happy, angry, sad, and neutral among the modalities of static and dynamic facial expression, prosody, verbal content, and all modalities combined. Results revealed that children with AS had more difficulty identifying emotions through static facial expression, dynamic facial expression, and prosody than typically developing children. Results are discussed in relationship to an over-reliance on verbal content as a compensatory strategy in social interactions. Treatment implications for individuals with AS are also discussed.
16639107		Current trends in psychological research on children with high-functioning autism and Asperger disorder.	Current opinion in psychiatry	2005	Connie Kasari, Erin Rotheram-Fuller		This review explores current trends in the literature during 2004 on psychological studies of children with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome. Studies are reviewed that examine diagnostic dilemmas and methodological concerns, cognitive and social deficits, and interventions.
16634517		Autistic spectrum disorders 2: diagnosis and management.	Community practitioner : the journal of the Community Practitioners' & Health Visitors' Association	2006	Alice Jones, Christine Cork, Uttom Chowdhury		As many as six in every 1000 children may be affected by an autistic spectrum disorder. The previous article of this two-part series discussed the distinction between autism, Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder, and examined the assessment process. This article looks at potential differential diagnoses that must be considered, as well as conditions associated with autism. Many theories about the causes of autism have been suggested, including the MMR vaccine. Recent research has suggested that there is no link between the vaccine and autism. There is no cure for autism, but intervention and management techniques should be aimed at educating parents and carers about the disorder and behavioural interventions to aid the child's skills development.
16628481		Using Carey Temperament Scales to assess behavioral style in children with autism spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Susan L Hepburn, Wendy L Stone		Many researchers have suggested that temperament information could be useful for understanding the behavioral variability within the autism spectrum. The purpose of this brief report is to examine temperament profiles of 110 children with ASD (ages 3-8 years, 61 with Autistic Disorder, 42 with PDD-NOS; and 7 with Asperger Disorder) via a commonly used parent report measure of child temperament. Internal consistency of temperament dimensions, test-retest reliability, descriptions of means and standard deviations are examined, relative to previously published norms. Internal consistency of the dimensions and test-retest reliability were comparable to published norms; however, children with autism were rated as presenting with more extreme scores than typically-developing children on several dimensions. Limitations and implications for future work are discussed.
16627223		Efficacy and safety of ertapenem versus piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of intra-abdominal infections requiring surgical intervention.	Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract	2006			Complicated intra-abdominal infections usually mandate prompt surgical intervention supplemented by appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The aim of this study was to demonstrate that ertapenem was not inferior to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections. A randomized open-label active-comparator clinical trial was conducted at 48 medical centers on four continents from December 2001 to February 2003. Adult patients with intra-abdominal infections requiring surgery were randomized to receive either ertapenem 1 g daily or piperacillin/tazobactam 13.5 g daily in 3-4 divided doses. The primary analysis of efficacy was the clinical response rate in clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients at the test-of-cure assessment 2 weeks after completion of therapy. All treated patients were included in the safety analysis. Patient demographics, disease characteristics, and treatment duration in both treatment groups were generally similar. The most commonly isolated pathogens at baseline were E coli (greater than 50% of cases in each group) and B fragilis ( approximately 9%). Favorable clinical response rates were 107/119 (90%) for ertapenem recipients and 107/114 (94%) for piperacillin/tazobactam recipients. The frequencies of drug-related adverse events, most commonly diarrhea and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase levels, were similar in both treatment groups. Six of 180 ertapenem recipients (3%) and two of 190 piperacillin/tazobactam recipients (1%) had serious drug-related adverse experiences. In this study, ertapenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were comparably safe and effective treatments for adult patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.
16617404		Sleep patterns of school-age children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Hiie Allik, Jan-Olov Larsson, Hans Smedje		Sleep patterns of 32 school-age children with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) were compared to those of 32 typically developing age- and gender-matched children, using parent survey and one week of diary and actigraphic monitoring. Parents of children with AS/HFA more commonly reported that their children had difficulty falling asleep. One week of sleep recording with diary and actigraphy confirmed that children in the AS/HFA group spent a longer time awake in bed before falling asleep than children in the control group, possibly because the children in the AS/HFA group had earlier bedtimes. Other essential aspects of sleep patterns coincided between the groups. The sleep patterns of children with AS and HFA did not differ.
16616862		Attention does not modulate neural responses to social stimuli in autism spectrum disorders.	NeuroImage	2006	Geoffrey Bird, Caroline Catmur, Giorgia Silani, Chris Frith, Uta Frith		We investigated whether individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) would show attentional modulation for social (face) and non-social (house) stimuli. Sixteen individuals with ASD and 16 matched control participants completed a task in which pairs of face and house stimuli were present on every trial, with one of the pairs randomly assigned to attended locations and the other to unattended locations. Both mass-univariate (SPM) and region of interest analyses suggested that responses to houses were modulated by attention in both groups, but that only the control participants demonstrated attentional modulation of face-selective regions. Thus, the participants with ASD demonstrated a lack of attentional modulation which was particularly evident for the social stimulus. Analyses of effective connectivity indicated that these results were due to a failure of attention to modulate connectivity between extrastriate areas and V1. We discuss how these results may suggest a mechanism to explain the reduced salience of social stimuli in ASD.
16616454		Global and configural visual processing in adults with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Research in developmental disabilities	2007	Cecilie Rondan, Christine Deruelle		This study was designed to explore how adults with autism and Asperger syndrome (ASD) would visually process compound figures. They were tested in two tasks, one involving hierarchical global/local stimuli, the other involving face-like or geometrical stimuli where the processing of the inter-elemental spatial relationships was emphasized. Adults with ASD showed, like controls, a preference for the global level of the hierarchical stimuli. With the stimuli involving inter-elemental spatial relationship manipulations, the adults with ASD showed a preference for local elements, whereas controls did not show a preference. This supports earlier findings from children with ASD, suggesting that though individuals with autism may process global aspects of stimuli in priority, they tend to specific aspects in stimuli containing both local and configural elements.
16614790		Screening for autistic spectrum in children aged 14 to 15 months. I: the development of the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire (ESAT).	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Sophie H N Swinkels, Claudine Dietz, Emma van Daalen, Ine H G M Kerkhof, Herman van Engeland, Jan K Buitelaar		This article describes the development of a screening instrument for young children. Screening items were tested first in a non-selected population of children aged 8-20 months (n = 478). Then, parents of children with clinically diagnosed ASD (n = 153, average age 87 months) or ADHD (n = 76, average age 112 months) were asked to score the items retrospectively for when their child was 14 months old. A 14-item screening instrument, Early Screening of Autistic Traits (ESAT) which had maximal sensitivity and specificity for ASD was developed. The sensitivity of the ESAT was checked in an independent sample of 34 children aged 16-48 months clinically diagnosed with ASD. A 4-item version appears to be a promising prescreening instrument.
16613868		A comparative study of the spontaneous social interactions of children with high-functioning autism and children with Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Kathleen Macintosh, Cheryl Dissanayake		A comparative observational study was undertaken of the spontaneous social interactions of children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder. The sample comprised 20 children with high-functioning autism, 19 children with Asperger's disorder and 17 typically developing children matched on chronological age and overall mental age. A one-zero time sampling technique was used in live coding of the children's spontaneous social and play behaviours in the schoolyard. Few differences were found between children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder on the dimensions of social interaction investigated. In contrast, the social behaviour of both clinical samples often deviated markedly from that of the typically developing children. The findings confirmed that although children with high-functioning autism or Asperger's disorder are often socially isolated relative to their typically developing peers, they are capable of spontaneously engaging socially with other children. The results were supportive of the hypothesis that Asperger's disorder is on a continuum with autistic disorder.
16613864		Social comparison processes and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Darren Hedley, Robyn Young		The present study investigated the relationship between social comparison processes and depressive symptoms in 36 participants (34 males and two females) aged 10 to 16 years with Asperger syndrome. Participants completed the Social Comparison Scale and the Children's Depression Inventory. Depressive symptoms were significantly correlated with the SCS (r = 0.52, p = 0.001), specifically perceived group membership (r = 0.56, p < 0.001). A regression analysis revealed that perceived group membership significantly and independently predicted depression scores (beta= 0.56, p = 0.002). It is suggested social comparison is a salient factor related to depressive symptoms in this group, and interventions involving adolescents with AS should therefore address this factor.

16609826		Motor signs distinguish children with high functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome from controls.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Eva M Jansiewicz, Melissa C Goldberg, Craig J Newschaffer, Martha B Denckla, Rebecca Landa, Stewart H Mostofsky		While many studies of motor control in autism have focused on specific motor signs, there has been a lack of research examining the complete range of subtle neuromotor signs. This study compared performance on a neurologic examination standardized for children (PANESS, Physical and Neurological Exam for Subtle Signs, Denckla [1974 Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology, 16(6), 729-741]) between a group of 40 boys aged 6-17 with autism and average range IQs and a group of 55 typically developing boys. The Autism group was shown to have significant impairment on several measures of motor control compared to the Control group. Regression analyses revealed that a model including four PANESS variables offered a high level of discrimination in distinguishing boys with high-functioning autism from controls.
16608544		Neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcome of children at age 6 and 7 years who screened positive for language problems at 30 months.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2006	Carmela Miniscalco, Gudrun Nygren, Bibbi Hagberg, Björn Kadesjö, Christopher Gillberg		We present a prospective study at school age of neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental outcome of language delay suspected at child health screening around 30 months of age. In a community sample, 25 children (21 males, 4 females) screening positive and 80 children (38 males, 42 females) screening negative for speech and language problems at age 30 months were examined in detail for language disorders at age 6 years. The screen-positive children were then followed for another year and underwent in-depth neuropsychiatric examination by assessors blind to the results of previous testing. Detailed follow-up results at age 7 years were available for 21 children. Thirteen of these 21 children (62%) had a major neuropsychiatric diagnosis (autism, atypical autism, Asperger's syndrome, attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]), or combinations of these. Two further children (10%) had borderline IQ with no other major diagnosis. We conclude that children in the general population who screen positive for speech and language problems before age 3 years appear to be at very high risk of autism spectrum disorders or ADHD, or both, at 7 years of age. Remaining language problems at age 6 years strongly predict the presence of neuropsychiatric or neurodevelopmental disorders at age 7 years.

16600069		Systemizing empathy: teaching adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism to recognize complex emotions using interactive multimedia.	Development and psychopathology	2006	Ofer Golan, Simon Baron-Cohen		This study evaluated Mind Reading, an interactive systematic guide to emotions, for its effectiveness in teaching adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) and high-functioning autism (HFA) to recognize complex emotions in faces and voices. Experiment 1 tested a group of adults diagnosed with AS/HFA (n = 19) who used the software at home for 10-15 weeks. Participants were tested on recognition of faces and voices at three different levels of generalization. A matched control group of adults with AS/HFA (n = 22) were assessed without any intervention. In addition, a third group of general population controls (n = 24) was tested. Experiment 2 repeated the design of Experiment 1 with a group of adults with AS/HFA who used the software at home and met in a group with a tutor on a weekly basis. They were matched to a control group of adults with AS/HFA attending social skills training and to a general population control group (n = 13 for all three groups). In both experiments the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group on close, but not distant, generalization tasks. Verbal IQ had significant effects in Experiment 2. Using Mind Reading for a relatively short period of time allows users to learn to recognize a variety of complex emotions and mental states. However, additional methods are required to enhance generalization.
16600060		Growth in stature and head circumference in high-functioning autism and Asperger disorder during the first 3 years of life.	Development and psychopathology	2006	Cheryl Dissanayake, Quang M Bui, Richard Huggins, Danuta Z Loesch		Little effort has been made to characterize the developmental anatomic phenotype of autism; although there is evidence of an increased head circumference and brain size, few other physical characteristics have been studied. The head circumference, body length/height, and weight measurements of infants, who were later diagnosed with high-functioning autism (HFA, n = 16) and Asperger disorder (AsD, n = 12), were extracted from health records over the first 3 years of life and compared to the measurements of a matched normal control group (n = 19). Using linear mixed-effects models, no differences were found in the average growth rate for head circumference, stature, or weight between the children with HFA and AsD. However, a significantly higher growth rate in body length/height and weight was found for the combined group of children with HFA and AsD compared to the normal control group. A trend toward higher growth rate in head circumference was also found among the former group. The results indicate that growth dysregulation in autism is not specific to the brain but also involves growth in stature.
16596080		Asperger syndrome revisited.	Reviews in neurological diseases	2006	Joseph H Baskin, Michael Sperber, Bruce H Price		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a disorder on the continuum of autistic spectrum disorders characterized by a lack of social reciprocity and empathy, and severe difficulties in social integration. Controversy remains as to what constitutes AS and whether it should be declared a separate disease or higher-functioning autism. This review discusses the contributions made by Hans Asperger and Leo Kanner in first delineating the condition, and examines the syndrome's incidence, prevalence, and etiologies. Recent studies using neuroimaging are described, along with current diagnostic and treatment options.
16594952		Clinical neurological abnormalities in young adults with Asperger syndrome.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2006	Pekka Tani, Nina Lindberg, Björn Appelberg, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen		Children with Asperger syndrome (AS), a neurodevelopmental disorder falling in the autism spectrum disorders, have an increased rate of neurological abnormalities, especially in motor coordination. While AS is a lifelong condition, little is known about the persistence of neurological abnormalities in adulthood. Twenty young adults with AS were compared with 10 healthy controls using a structured clinical neurological rating scale. The score for neurological abnormalities was higher in the AS group. In addition, a subscore for neurological soft signs indicating defective functioning of the central nervous system with a non-localizing value was significantly higher in the AS subjects. This preliminary study indicates that neurological abnormalities, soft signs in particular, represent a non-specific vulnerability factor for AS. Consistent with other features of AS, neurological abnormalities seem to persist into adulthood.
16586157		The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) in Japan: A cross-cultural comparison.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Akio Wakabayashi, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright, Yoshikuni Tojo		The AQ (Autism-Spectrum Quotient) is a self-administered instrument for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. The AQ was administered in Japan to test whether the UK results would generalize to a very different culture. Three groups of subjects, adults with AS or HFA (n = 57), adult controls (n = 194), and University students (n = 1050) were assessed. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score which was significantly higher than both the controls and the University students. Among the controls, males scored significantly higher than females. The similarity of results in both the general population and the clinical group across the two cultures was remarkable.

16575542		Executive functioning in children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder: can we differentiate within the spectrum?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Sylvie Verté, Hilde M Geurts, Herbert Roeyers, Jaap Oosterlaan, Joseph A Sergeant		The aim of this study was to investigate whether children with high-functioning autism (HFA), Asperger's syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS) can be differentiated from each other and from normal controls on their neurocognitive executive functioning (EF) profile. Children with HFA and AS showed the most EF deficits. The EF profile of the PDDNOS group was more disturbed that the normal control group, but was less disturbed than the profile of the HFA and AS groups. Little difference was found between the three PDD subtypes with respect to EF. This study supports the view that executive dysfunctioning plays an important role in autism. The usefulness of a distinction between different PDD subtypes was not demonstrated.
16571517		A test of central coherence theory: can adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome integrate fragments of an object?	Cognitive neuropsychiatry	2001	T Jolliffe, S Baron-Cohen		Visuoconceptual integration was explored as a test of central coherence theory (Frith, 1989). Individuals with autism are thought to have weak central coherence so the prediction was that these individuals would show an impaired ability to integrate visual information.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Christopher Gillberg, Mats Cederlund, Kerstin Lamberg, Lena Zeijlon		The objective of this study was to establish rates of diagnosed autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) in a circumscribed geographical region. The total population born in 1977-1994, living in Göteborg Sweden in 2001, was screened for ASD in registers of the Child Neuropsychiatry Clinic. The minimum registered rate of autistic disorder was 20.5 in 10,000. Other ASDs were 32.9 in 10,000, including 9.2 in 10,000 with Asperger syndrome. Males predominated. In the youngest group (7-12 years), 1.23% had a registered diagnosis of ASD. There was an increase in the rate of diagnosed registered ASD over time; the cause was not determined. The increase tended to level off in the younger age cohort, perhaps due to Asperger syndrome cases missed in screening.
16566949		The 'amygdala theory of autism' revisited: linking structure to behavior.	Neuropsychologia	2006	Isabel Dziobek, Stefan Fleck, Kimberley Rogers, Oliver T Wolf, Antonio Convit		The 'amygdala theory of autism' suggests a crucial role for the amygdala in the neurobiological basis of autism spectrum disorders. However, to date evidence is lacking of a direct relationship between amygdala measures and behavioral manifestations of autism in affected individuals. In 17 adult individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 17 well-matched controls we therefore assessed associations between MRI-derived amygdala volume and behavioral variables of emotion recognition and social cognition, as well as with core AS symptomatology. Results revealed that individuals with AS exhibited impairments in emotion recognition and social cognition compared to controls and also showed atypical relationships between amygdala volumes and overall head size. We found positive associations between emotional and social understanding and amygdala volume in the control group, but not in the AS group. In the AS group however, amygdala size was negatively related to diagnostic parameters, with smaller amygdala volumes involving higher levels of restricted-repetitive behavior domains. Our data seem to indicate that in AS the amygdala is not crucially involved in social and emotional understanding. It may, however, be a mediator for narrow interest patterns and the imposition of routines and rituals. Our data, in conjunction with current literature, seem to argue for a modification of the 'amygdala theory of autism'.
16565884		Normal physiological emotions but differences in expression of conscious feelings in children with high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	D Ben Shalom, S H Mostofsky, R L Hazlett, M C Goldberg, R J Landa, Y Faran, D R McLeod, R Hoehn-Saric		To provide insight into what aspects of the emotional circuit might be affected in high-functioning autism, we measured indices of physiological emotions and of the expression of conscious feelings in 10 children with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome and 10 comparison participants. Pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral pictures were presented while skin conductance responses were measured. Self-report ratings of pleasantness and interestingness were taken between pictures. Skin conductance responses did not differ between the groups. Self report ratings were different, with the children with autism giving more similar answers to the two questions than the comparison children. Impairments in socio-emotional expression in autism may be related to deficits in perception and/or expression of conscious feelings; physiological emotions may be relatively preserved.

16554961		Gait function in high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder : evidence for basal-ganglia and cerebellar involvement?	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2006	Nicole J Rinehart, Bruce J Tonge, John L Bradshaw, Robert Iansek, Peter G Enticott, Jenny McGinley		Gait abnormalities have been widely reported in individuals with autism and Asperger's disorder. There is controversy as to whether the cerebellum or the basal-ganglia frontostriatal regions underpin these abnormalities. This is the first direct comparison of gait and upper-body postural features in autism and Asperger's disorder. Clinical and control groups were matched according to age, height, weight, performance, and full scale IQ. Consistent with Hallet's (1993) cerebellar-gait hypothesis, the autistic group showed significantly increased stride-length variability in their gait in comparison to control and Asperger's disorder participants. No quantitative gait deficits were found for the Asperger's disorder group. In support of Damasio and Maurer's (1982) basal-ganglia frontostriatal-gait hypothesis, both clinical groups were rated as showing abnormal arm posturing, however, only the Asperger's group were rated as significantly different from controls in terms of head and trunk posturing. While DSM-IV-TR suggests that Asperger's disorder, but not autism, is associated with motoric clumsiness, our data suggest that both clinical groups are uncoordinated and lacking in motor smoothness. Gait differences in autism and Asperger's disorder were suggested to reflect differential involvement of the cerebellum, with commonalities reflecting similar involvement of the basal-ganglia frontostriatal region.
16553084		Autistic spectrum disorders. 1: Presentation and assessment.	Community practitioner : the journal of the Community Practitioners' & Health Visitors' Association	2006	Alice Jones, Christine Cork, Uttom Chowdhury		As many as six in every 1000 children may be affected by an autistic spectrum disorder. Characterised by a triad of social communication difficulties, these children exhibit impairment in communication and socialisation, and restricted and repetitive interests, movements and activities. This article will discuss the distinction between autism, Asperger's syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder. Assessment should include a history of the child's development, observation, school report and a profile of the child's strengths and weaknesses. However, it is important that potential differential diagnoses as well as conditions associated with autism are also considered. Differential diagnoses, management and possible causes of autistic spectrum disorders will be discussed in more detail in next month's Clinical Updates.
16552625		The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ)--adolescent version.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Simon Baron-Cohen, Rosa A Hoekstra, Rebecca Knickmeyer, Sally Wheelwright		The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) quantifies autistic traits in adults. This paper adapted the AQ for children (age 9.8-15.4 years). Three groups of participants were assessed: Group 1: n=52 adolescents with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: n=79 adolescents with classic autism; and Group 3, n=50 controls. The adolescents with AS/HFA did not differ significantly from the adolescents with autism but both clinical groups scored higher than controls. Approximately 90% of the adolescents with AS/HFA and autism scored 30+, vs. none of the controls. Among the controls, boys scored higher than girls. The AQ can rapidly quantify where an adolescent is situated on the continuum from autism to normality.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	2006	Nicole J Rinehart, Bruce J Tonge, John L Bradshaw, Robert Iansek, Peter G Enticott, Katherine A Johnson		Autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) are neurodevelopmental conditions that affect cognitive and social-communicative function. Using a movement-related potential (MRP) paradigm, we investigated the clinical and neurobiological issue of 'disorder separateness' versus 'disorder variance' in autism and AD. This paradigm has been used to assess basal ganglia/supplementary motor functioning in Parkinson's disease. Three groups (high functioning autism [HFA]: 16 males, 1 female; mean age 12y 5mo [SD 4y 4mo]; AD: 11 males, 2 females; mean age 13y 5mo [SD 3y 8mo]; comparison group: 13 males, 8 females; mean age 13y 10mo [SD 3y 11mo]) completed a cued motor task during electroencephalogram recording of MRPs. The HFA group showed reduced peak amplitude at Cz, indicating less activity over the supplementary motor area during movement preparation. Although an overall significant between-group effect was found for early slope and peak amplitude, sub-analysis revealed that the group with AD did not differ significantly from either group. However, it is suggested that autism and AD may be dissociated on the basis of brain-behaviour correlations of IQ with specific neurobiological measures. The overlap between MRP traces for autism and Parkinson's disease suggests that the neurobiological wiring of motor functioning in autism may bypass the supplementary motor area/primary motor cortex pathway.
16537236		Theory of mind in Asperger's syndrome, schizophrenia and personality disordered forensic patients.	Cognitive neuropsychiatry	2006	David Murphy	Broadmoor Hospital, Crowthorne, UK. david.murphy@wlmht.nhs.uk	The ability to conceptualise other individuals' mental states is dependent on having a 'theory of mind' (ToM). Individuals with Asperger's syndrome typically display ToM impairments, as do some individuals with schizophrenia, notably those with paranoid delusions. The presenting features of these and other individuals, such as those with some personality disorders, particularly in forensic patients, are often unclear. ToM performance was examined to see whether it could distinguish forensic patients with Asperger's syndrome from other patient groups.
16533076		Text chat as a tool for referential questioning in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR	2006	Gnanathusharan Rajendran, Peter Mitchell		This article reports a study in which referential communication in 11 individuals with Asperger syndrome (AS) and 11 controls was compared between text chat and telephone, using a route-solving task.
16523252		The extent of social anxiety in combination with mental disorders.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2006	Siebke Melfsen, Susanne Walitza, Andreas Warnke		The aim of the study was to investigate the extent of social anxiety in different mental disorders. A total of 341 patients aged 7-18 years participated in the study. To measure social anxiety, the German version (SPAIK) of the Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory for Children (SPAI-C) was used. Subgroups were built dependent on mental disorders. A total score above 20, which was assumed to indicate social anxiety, was observed in children with selective mutism (n = 9; M = 22.68; SD = 11.29) and in children with Asperger's Syndrome (n = 7; M = 20.77; SD = 13.77). Patients who had the following mental disorders also showed a higher total score of social anxiety: obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, depression and conduct disorder. In none of these disorders, however, did the mean total score exceed the cut-off of 20.
16522713		Presentation of depression in autism and Asperger syndrome: a review.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Mary E Stewart, Louise Barnard, Joanne Pearson, Reem Hasan, Gregory O'Brien		Depression is common in autism and Asperger syndrome, but despite this, there has been little research into this issue. This review considers the current literature on the prevalence, presentation, treatment and assessment of depression in autism and Asperger syndrome. There are diagnostic difficulties when considering depression in autism and Asperger syndrome, as the characteristics of these disorders, such as social withdrawal and appetite and sleep disturbance, are also core symptoms of depression. Impaired verbal and non-verbal communication can mask the symptoms of depression. Symptoms associated with autism and Asperger syndrome such as obsessionality and self-injury may be increased during an episode of depression. There is a clear need to develop specific tools both for diagnostic purposes and for measurement of depression in autism and Asperger syndrome in order to help alleviate the distress caused by this treatable illness.
16522711		Pseudo-random number generation in children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder: further evidence for a dissociation in executive functioning?	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2006	Nicole J Rinehart, John L Bradshaw, Simon A Moss, Avril V Brereton, Bruce J Tonge		The repetitive, stereotyped and obsessive behaviours, which are core diagnostic features of autism, are thought to be underpinned by executive dysfunction. This study examined executive impairment in individuals with autism and Asperger's disorder using a verbal equivalent of an established pseudo-random number generating task. Different patterns of disinhibition emerged in the autism (n = 12) and Asperger's disorder (n = 12) groups. Consistent with previous research, the autism group repeated single numbers (e.g. 2, 2, 2) more frequently than the control group. In contrast to past research suggesting intact executive abilities, this study found that the Asperger's disorder group generated more repetitive number patterns (e.g. 45, 45) than the controls. Executive functioning in children with Asperger's disorder may be particularly vulnerable to a lack of visual cueing and concrete rules. Qualitative differences in executive dysfunction between these groups may implicate differential disruption within the fronto-striatal circuitry.
16519981		The hyper-systemizing, assortative mating theory of autism.	Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry	2006	Simon Baron-Cohen	Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18b Trumpington Road, Cambridge, CB2 2AH, UK. sb205@cam.ac.uk	The hyper-systemizing theory of autism proposes that the systemizing mechanism is set too high in people with autism. As a result, they can only cope with highly lawful systems, and cannot cope with systems of high variance or change (such as the social world of other minds). They appear 'change-resistant'. This proposal extends the extreme male brain theory of autism. Finally, evidence is reviewed for autism being the genetic result of assortative mating of two high systemizers.
16516441		Current status of differential diagnosis for children with autism spectrum disorders.	Research in developmental disabilities	2007	Johnny L Matson	Department of Psychology, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA 70803, USA. johnmatson@aol.com <johnmatson@aol.com>	Early intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has proven to be a successful strategy for remediating many difficulties experienced by these children. As a result, accurate diagnoses of children with this range of disorders has become more critical. Additionally, while current training programs are for 3-4 year olds, in efforts to start treatment at younger ages, clinicians are giving these diagnoses at younger and younger ages. A considerable amount of research activity on a technology for making differential diagnoses of ASD has been emerging in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of some of these developments, and to offer opinions on the current status of the area.
16512970		Attention bias to faces in Asperger Syndrome: a pictorial emotion Stroop study.	Psychological medicine	2006	Chris Ashwin, Sally Wheelwright, Simon Baron-Cohen		Emotional Stroop tasks have shown attention biases of clinical populations towards stimuli related to their condition. Asperger Syndrome (AS) is a neuropsychiatric condition with social and communication deficits, repetitive behaviours and narrow interests. Social deficits are particularly striking, including difficulties in understanding others.

16503169		Factors affecting conscious awareness in the recollective experience of adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Consciousness and cognition	2007	Dermot M Bowler, John M Gardiner, Sebastian B Gaigg		have shown a small but significant impairment of autonoetic awareness or remembering involved in the episodic memory experiences of adults with Asperger's syndrome. This was compensated by an increase in experiences of noetic awareness or knowing. The question remains as to whether the residual autonoetic awareness in Asperger individuals is qualitatively the same as that of typical comparison participants. Three experiments are presented in which manipulations that have shown differential effects on different kinds of conscious awareness in memory in typical populations are employed with a sample of adults with Asperger's syndrome. The results suggest that the experiences of remembering reported by such individuals, although reduced in quantity, are qualitatively similar to those seen in the typical population. The results are discussed in the context of current theories of awareness in episodic memory.
16500009		Tactile sensitivity in Asperger syndrome.	Brain and cognition	2006	Sarah-Jayne Blakemore, Teresa Tavassoli, Susana Calò, Richard M Thomas, Caroline Catmur, Uta Frith, Patrick Haggard		People with autism and Asperger syndrome are anecdotally said to be hypersensitive to touch. In two experiments, we measured tactile thresholds and suprathreshold tactile sensitivity in a group of adults with Asperger syndrome. In the first experiment, tactile perceptual thresholds were measured. Two frequencies of vibrotactile stimulation were used: 30 and 200 Hz. The results demonstrated significantly lower tactile perceptual thresholds in the Asperger group at 200 Hz but not at 30 Hz, thus confirming tactile hypersensitivity but only for one class of stimulus. A second experiment investigated whether self-produced movement affected the perception of touch in a group of adults with Asperger syndrome. A suprathreshold tactile stimulus was produced either by the participant (self-produced condition) or by the experimenter (externally produced condition) and participants were asked to rate the perception of the tactile stimulation. The results demonstrated that, while both Asperger and control groups rated self-produced touch as less tickly than external touch, the Asperger group rated both types of tactile stimulus as significantly more tickly and intense than did the control group. This experiment confirms the finding of tactile hypersensitivity, but shows that the perceptual consequences of self-produced touch are attenuated in the normal way in people with Asperger syndrome. An abnormality in this process cannot therefore account for their tactile hypersensitivity.
16485174		WISC-R subtest but no overall VIQ-PIQ difference in Dutch children with PDD-NOS.	Journal of abnormal child psychology	2006	Esther I de Bruin, Fop Verheij, Robert F Ferdinand		VIQ-PIQ differences have been studied in children with autism and Asperger syndrome but have not been studied in a separate group of children with PDD-NO, although, PDD-NOS has a much higher prevalence rate than autism and deficits in communication and social interaction are severe. The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) was administered to 100 children, aged 6-12 years, with PDD-NOS (n = 76), autism (n = 13), and Asperger syndrome (n = 11). PDD-NOS was diagnosed using explicit research criteria. No overall differences between VIQ and PIQ were found in PDD-NOS and autism. Peaks in the subtest scores on Information, Similarities, Picture Arrangement, and Mazes, and troughs in the subtest scores on Comprehension, Digit Span, and Coding were demonstrated in children with PDD-NOS. Their score on the Freedom from Distractibility factor was lower than the scores on the Verbal Comprehension factor and the Perceptual Organization factor. Children with PDD-NOS seemed to have a similar VIQ-PIQ profile as children with autism, and on the subtest level children with PDD-NOS showed some similarities to children with Asperger syndrome or autism. It was not possible to distinguish PDD-NOS from autism or Asperger syndrome by using IQ scores.
16477516		Motion and form coherence detection in autistic spectrum disorder: Relationship to motor control and 2:4 digit ratio.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Elizabeth Milne, Sarah White, Ruth Campbell, John Swettenham, Peter Hansen, Franck Ramus		Children with autistic spectrum disorder and controls performed tasks of coherent motion and form detection, and motor control. Additionally, the ratio of the 2nd and 4th digits of these children, which is thought to be an indicator of foetal testosterone, was measured. Children in the experimental group were impaired at tasks of motor control, and had lower 2D:4D than controls. There were no group differences in motion or form detection. However a sub-group of children with autism were selectively impaired at motion detection. There were significant relationships between motion coherence detection and motor control in both groups of children, and also between motion detection, fine motor control and 2D:4D in the group of children with autistic spectrum disorder.
16477515		The Cambridge Mindreading (CAM) Face-Voice Battery: Testing complex emotion recognition in adults with and without Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Ofer Golan, Simon Baron-Cohen, Jacqueline Hill		Adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) can recognise simple emotions and pass basic theory of mind tasks, but have difficulties recognising more complex emotions and mental states. This study describes a new battery of tasks, testing recognition of 20 complex emotions and mental states from faces and voices. The battery was given to males and females with AS and matched controls. Results showed the AS group performed worse than controls overall, on emotion recognition from faces and voices and on 12/20 specific emotions. Females recognised faces better than males regardless of diagnosis, and males with AS had more difficulties recognising emotions from faces than from voices. The implications of these results are discussed in relation to social functioning in AS.
16467216		Independent replication and initial fine mapping of 3p21-24 in Asperger syndrome.	Journal of medical genetics	2006	K Rehnström, T Ylisaukko-oja, T Nieminen-von Wendt, S Sarenius, T Källman, E Kempas, L von Wendt, L Peltonen, I Järvelä		Asperger syndrome is characterised by abnormalities in social interaction as well as repetitive and stereotyped behaviours and interests. The trait is thought to display complex inheritance, but in a subset of families the inheritance resembles the autosomal dominant model. Linkage to 3p14-24 has recently been reported in Asperger syndrome in Finnish families with a maximum multipoint NPL(all) of 3.32 at D3S2432.

Autism and AS are genetic conditions and parents may show the 'broader autism phenotype.'
16459007		Monozygotic twins with Asperger syndrome: differences in behaviour reflect variations in brain structure and function.	Brain and cognition	2006	Matthew K Belmonte, Ruth A Carper		A pair of monozygotic twins discordant for symptoms of Asperger syndrome was evaluated at the age of 13.45 years using psychometric, morphometric, behavioural, and functional imaging methods. The lower-functioning twin had a smaller brain overall, a smaller right cerebellum, and a disproportionately large left frontal lobe, and manifested almost no differential activation between distractors of high and low-congruence with target visual stimuli. The higher-functioning twin manifested a typically autistic pattern of anterior deactivation and posterior hyperactivation in response to incongruent distractors, overlaid with a typically normal pattern of activation of superior frontal cortex. The morphometric results are consistent with known correlations between brain structure and behaviour in autism, and the physiological results suggest correspondences between structure and function.
16458402		An islet of social ability in Asperger Syndrome: judging social attributes from faces.	Brain and cognition	2006	Sarah White, Elisabeth Hill, Joel Winston, Uta Frith		We asked adults with Asperger Syndrome to judge pictorial stimuli in terms of certain social stereotypes to evaluate to what extent they have access to this type of social knowledge. Sixteen adults with Asperger Syndrome and 24 controls, matched for age and intelligence, were presented with sets of faces, bodies and objects, which had to be rated on a 7-point scale in terms of trustworthiness, attractiveness, social status, and age, or, in the case of objects, price. Despite impaired performance on two important aspects of social cognition (second-order mentalizing and face recognition) the social judgements of the individuals with Asperger Syndrome were just as competent and consistent as those of their matched controls, with only one exception: there was a trend for them to be less able to judge the attractiveness of faces if they were the same sex. We explain this difference in terms of a weakness in mentalizing, specifically the ability to take a different point of view: While all other stereotypic attributions could be made from an egocentric point of view, judging the attractiveness of faces of one's own sex requires taking the perspective of someone of the opposite sex, a challenge for people with mentalizing problems. We conclude that individuals with Asperger Syndrome show preserved aspects of social knowledge, as revealed in the attribution of stereotypes to pictures of people. These findings suggest that there are dissociable subcomponents to social cognition and that not all of these are compromised in Asperger Syndrome.
16455174		Finding a face in the crowd: testing the anger superiority effect in Asperger Syndrome.	Brain and cognition	2006	Chris Ashwin, Sally Wheelwright, Simon Baron-Cohen		Social threat captures attention and is processed rapidly and efficiently, with many lines of research showing involvement of the amygdala. Visual search paradigms looking at social threat have shown angry faces 'pop-out' in a crowd, compared to happy faces. Autism and Asperger Syndrome (AS) are neurodevelopmental conditions characterised by social deficits, abnormal face processing, and amygdala dysfunction. We tested adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) and AS using a facial visual search paradigm with schematic neutral and emotional faces. We found, contrary to predictions, that people with HFA/AS performed similarly to controls in many conditions. However, the effect was reduced in the HFA/AS group when using widely varying crowd sizes and when faces were inverted, suggesting a difference in face-processing style may be evident even with simple schematic faces. We conclude there are intact threat detection mechanisms in AS, under simple and predictable conditions, but that like other face-perception tasks, the visual search of threat faces task reveals atypical face-processing in HFA/AS.
16455173		High functioning children with autism spectrum disorder: a novel test of multitasking.	Brain and cognition	2006	Rachael Mackinlay, Tony Charman, Annette Karmiloff-Smith		High functioning children with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndrome (HF-ASD) often experience difficulties organising goal-directed actions in their day-to-day lives, requiring support to schedule daily activities. This study aimed to capture these everyday difficulties experimentally using multitasking, a methodology that taps into the cognitive processes necessary for successful goal-directed activities in everyday life. We investigated multitasking in children with HF-ASD using a novel multitask test, the Battersea Multitask Paradigm. Thirty boys participated in the study, 14 with HF-ASD and 16 typically developing controls, matched for age and IQ. Group differences in multitasking were observed. Participants with HF-ASD were less efficient at planning, attempted fewer tasks, switched inflexibly between tasks and broke performance rules more frequently than controls.
16453071		Enhanced perceptual functioning in autism: an update, and eight principles of autistic perception.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Laurent Mottron, Michelle Dawson, Isabelle Soulières, Benedicte Hubert, Jake Burack		"We propose an ""Enhanced Perceptual Functioning"" model encompassing the main differences between autistic and non-autistic social and non-social perceptual processing: locally oriented visual and auditory perception, enhanced low-level discrimination, use of a more posterior network in ""complex"" visual tasks, enhanced perception of first order static stimuli, diminished perception of complex movement, autonomy of low-level information processing toward higher-order operations, and differential relation between perception and general intelligence. Increased perceptual expertise may be implicated in the choice of special ability in savant autistics, and in the variability of apparent presentations within PDD (autism with and without typical speech, Asperger syndrome) in non-savant autistics. The overfunctioning of brain regions typically involved in primary perceptual functions may explain the autistic perceptual endophenotype."
16450044		The microgenesis of global perception in autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2006	Kate Plaisted, Veronica Dobler, Stuart Bell, Greg Davis		Several studies have reported that individuals with autism and Asperger's syndrome show a local processing bias on tasks involving features and configurations. This study assessed whether this bias results from differences in the perception of features or a cognitive bias to attend to features in autism as a consequence of a deficit in attending to configurations. Children with autism and typically developing children performed a task assessing the initial perceptual representation of features and configurations following a 50 ms stimulus display and the development of the perceptual representation by grouping processes following an 800 ms stimulus display. No differences were observed between the two groups, suggesting that the perceptual and attentional mechanisms marshalled by this task operate typically in children with autism.

16419094		Etiologic yield of autistic spectrum disorders: a prospective study.	American journal of medical genetics. Part C, Seminars in medical genetics	2006	Agatino Battaglia, John C Carey		"Studies addressing etiologic yield in childhood developmental disabilities have mainly looked at individuals with developmental delay/mental retardation. The few studies addressing the question of etiologic yield in patients with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) had a major drawback, in that the enrolled subjects were diagnosed as having the autistic spectrum disorders based only on history and clinical examination, and/or on unspecified instruments. In addition, only some of these patients underwent a complete laboratory evaluation. To investigate the etiologic yield of PDDs, we undertook a large prospective study on subjects selected according to very strict criteria and diagnosed as having PDD based on the present ""gold standard"" (ADI-R and ADOS-G), and a clinical diagnosis made by a child psychiatrist. Eighty-five (85) patients with PDD and their first degree relatives participated in this study. These patients were selected from a sample of 236 subjects who had received a clinical diagnosis of PDD at the Stella Maris Institute between March 2002 and 2005. Selection criteria for entering the study were: (1) a diagnosis of PDD (with exclusion of the Rett syndrome) confirmed after the administration of the ADI-R (autism diagnostic interview-revised) and the ADOS-G (autism diagnostic observation schedule-generic). In addition, a clinical diagnosis was made by the child psychiatrist, on the basis of presence or absence of DSM-IV symptoms of autism; (2) chronological age between 4 and 18 years; (3) IQ>30; (4) availability of both biologic parents. Patients, 65/85 (76.5%), had autism, 18/85 (21.2%) had PDD-NOS, and the remaining 2/85 (2.3%) had Asperger syndrome. Ages varied between 4 years 2 months and 12 years 5 months (mean 7.6 years), and there was a marked male preponderance (68/85). All subjects underwent various laboratory studies and neuroimaging. With respect to possible etiologic determination, a detailed history and physical examination in this group of patients with PDD was informative in 10.5% (9/85). HRB karyotype was diagnostic in one, and molecular fragile X studies in one child. Brain MRI was informative in two children (2.3%) with relative macrocrania but no neurological features; and EEG was helpful in one child, identifying a Landau-Kleffner disorder. Audiometry and brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) showed a bilateral sensorineural loss in another child. Metabolic evaluation gave normal results in all subjects. The results suggest an evaluation paradigm with reference to etiologic determination for individuals with PDDs that does not presently justify metabolic or neuroimaging on a screening basis. Recurrence risk, treatment implications, and significant and long-lasting emotional relief for the parents suggest that serious consideration be given to clinical genetic examination, genetic testing, EEG study (during wakefulness and sleep), and audiometry, despite a relatively low yield."

16417661		Autism following a history of newborn encephalopathy: more than a coincidence?	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2006	Nadia Badawi, Glenys Dixon, Janine F Felix, John M Keogh, Beverly Petterson, Fiona J Stanley, Jennifer J Kurinczuk		Between June 1993 and December 1996, 276 term newborn infants with encephalopathy and 564 randomly selected term controls were enrolled in a population-based study of moderate and severe term newborn encephalopathy (NE) in Western Australia. During comprehensive neurobehavioural and cognitive follow-up of all patients and controls at 3 years and again at 5 years of age we found an unexpected but strong association between NE and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). A diagnosis of ASD by age 5 years was reached using criteria according of the Diagnostic Statistical Manual, 4th edition. Linking records to the Western Australian Disability Services Commission Register ensured that no child in the study with ASD was missed. By age 5 years, 37 (13.4%) infants with NE and one (0.2%) control had died. Among the 239 survivors of NE, 12 (5%) were diagnosed with an ASD. Of these, 10 (4.2%) met the full criteria for autism, one had pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified, and one had Asperger syndrome. Among the 563 surviving controls, five (0.8%) were diagnosed with an ASD: three with autism, one with autism/possible Asperger syndrome, and one with Asperger syndrome. Compared with the controls, the children who had experienced NE were 5.9 times (95% confidence interval 2.0-16.9) more likely to have been diagnosed with an ASD.

16411178		Is selective mutism associated with deficits in memory span and visual memory?: An exploratory case-control study.	Depression and anxiety	2006	Hanne Kristensen, Beate Oerbeck		Our main aim in this study was to explore the association between selective mutism (SM) and aspects of nonverbal cognition such as visual memory span and visual memory. Auditory-verbal memory span was also examined. The etiology of SM is unclear, and it probably represents a heterogeneous condition. SM is associated with language impairment, but nonspecific neurodevelopmental factors, including motor problems, are also reported in SM without language impairment. Furthermore, SM is described in Asperger's syndrome. Studies on nonverbal cognition in SM thus merit further investigation. Neuropsychological tests were administered to a clinical sample of 32 children and adolescents with SM (ages 6-17 years, 14 boys and 18 girls) and 62 nonreferred controls matched for age, gender, and socioeconomic status. We used independent t-tests to compare groups with regard to auditory-verbal memory span, visual memory span, and visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test), and employed linear regression analysis to study the impact of SM on visual memory, controlling for IQ and measures of language and motor function. The SM group differed from controls on auditory-verbal memory span but not on visual memory span. Controlled for IQ, language, and motor function, the SM group did not differ from controls on visual memory. Motor function was the strongest predictor of visual memory performance. SM does not appear to be associated with deficits in visual memory span or visual memory. The reduced auditory-verbal memory span supports the association between SM and language impairment. More comprehensive neuropsychological studies are needed.

The Journal of clinical psychiatry	2005	Jeffrey L Rausch, Elizabeth L Sirota, Donna L Londino, Maria E Johnson, Benjamin M Carr, Renu Bhatia, Stephen Miller		Asperger's disorder consists of negative symptoms similar to those seen in schizophrenia, autism, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. We investigated whether risperidone, which is effective in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, would improve such symptoms observed in Asperger's disorder in a prospective, open-label trial.
16401146		Diagnosis and evaluation of pervasive developmental disorders.	The Journal of clinical psychiatry	2005	Lawrence Scahill	Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. lawrence.scahill@yale.edu	Accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), including autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, are necessary to ensure the best possible outcomes for children with these disorders. In the past, it was not uncommon for children with PDDs to wait several years from the time of parental recognition of developmental delay to the determination of the correct diagnosis and initiation of treatment. Increased awareness of PDDs and the availability of better assessment tools have improved the detection of these conditions in children. A wide variety of standardized diagnostic checklists, interviews, and observational measures are available to assist the clinician in making an accurate PDD diagnosis. A comprehensive evaluation also establishes a baseline of adaptive functioning and problematic behavior, which is essential for subsequent assessment of progress. This article discusses the differential diagnosis and evaluation of PDDs, focusing on the various assessment tools. The elements of a contemporary diagnostic evaluation and behavioral assessment are presented. The application of discretionary evaluations for special situations are also introduced.
16401144		Epidemiology of autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders.	The Journal of clinical psychiatry	2005	Eric Fombonne	Department of Psychiatry, McGill University, Montreal Children's Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. eric.fombonne@mcgill.ca	Is the incidence of autistic disorder and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) increasing? Recent epidemiological surveys of autistic disorder and other PDDs have heightened awareness of and concern about the prevalence of these disorders; however, differences in survey methodology, particularly changes in case definition and case identification over time, have made comparisons between surveys difficult to perform and interpret. Recent surveys suggest that the rate of all PDDs is about 60 per 10,000. The prevalence of autism today is estimated at 13 per 10,000, Asperger's disorder is approximately 3 per 10,000, and childhood disintegrative disorder is very rare at about 0.2 per 10,000. The assessment process, sample size, publication year, and geographic location of studies all have an effect on prevalence estimates. In addition, data from many of these surveys indicate correlates of autistic disorder and other PDDs with IQ, gender, and other medical disorders.
16393335		Health-related quality of life in parents of school-age children with Asperger Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism.	Health and quality of life outcomes	2006	Hiie Allik, Jan-Olov Larsson, Hans Smedje		The estimated prevalence rate of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) in children is 6 per 1.000. Parenting children who are intellectually impaired and have PDDs is known to be linked to the impaired well-being of the parents themselves. However, there is still little available data on health-related quality of life (HRQL) in parents of children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) and High-Functioning Autism (HFA), or other PDD diagnoses in children of normal intelligence. The present study aimed to evaluate aspects of HRQL in parents of school-age children with AS/HFA and the correlates with child behaviour characteristics.

16355606		Schizophrenia and related disorders in children and adolescents.	Journal of neural transmission. Supplementum	2005	H Remschmidt, F M Theisen		This paper reviews the concept and recent studies on childhood and adolescent psychoses with special reference to schizophrenia. After a short historical introduction, the definition, classification, and epidemiology of child- and adolescent-onset psychoses are described, pointing out that some early-onset psychotic states seem to be related to schizophrenia (such as infantile catatonia) and others not (such as desintegrative disorder). The frequency of childhood schizophrenia is less than 1 in 10,000 children, but there is a remarkable increase in frequency between 13 and 18 years of age. Currently, schizophrenia is diagnosed according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria. The differential diagnosis includes autism, desintegrative disorder, multiplex complex developmental disorder (MCDD) respectively multiple developmental impairment (MDI), affective psychoses, Asperger syndrome, drug-induced psychosis and psychotic states caused by organic disorders. With regard to etiology, there is strong evidence for the importance of genetic factors and for neurointegrative deficits preceding the onset of the disorder. Treatment is based upon a multimodal approach including antipsychotic medication (mainly by atypical neuroleptics), psychotherapeutic measures, family-oriented measures, and specific measures of rehabilitation applied in about 30% of the patients after completion of inpatient treatment. The long-term course of childhood- and adolescent-onset schizophrenia is worse than in adulthood schizophrenia, and the patients with manifestation of the disorder below the age of 14 have a very poor prognosis.
16331530		The Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA): a diagnostic method.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright, Janine Robinson, Marc Woodbury-Smith		At the present time there are a large number of adults who have suspected Asperger syndrome (AS). In this paper we describe a new instrument, the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA), developed in our clinic for adults with AS. The need for a new instrument relevant to the diagnosis of AS in adulthood arises because existing instruments are designed for use with children. Properties of the AAA include (1) being electronic, data-based, and computer-scorable; (2) linking with two screening instruments [the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and the Empathy Quotient (EQ)]; and (3) employing a more stringent set of diagnostic criteria than DSM-IV, in order to avoid false positives. The AAA is described, and its use with a series of n = 42 clinic-patients is reported. Thirty-seven of these (88%) met DSM-IV criteria, but only 34 of these (80%) met AAA criteria. The AAA is therefore more conservative than DSM-IV.
16328713		Spatial cognition in autism spectrum disorders: superior, impaired, or just intact?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Jamie O Edgin, Bruce F Pennington		The profile of spatial ability is of interest across autism spectrum disorders (ASD) because of reported spatial strengths in ASD and due to the recent association of Asperger's syndrome with Nonverbal Learning Disability. Spatial functions were examined in relation to two cognitive theories in autism: the central coherence and executive function (EF) theories. Performance on spatial tasks, EFs, and global/local processing was compared in children with ASD and controls. While the ASD group had faster reaction times on the Embedded Figures task, spatial performance was intact, but not superior, on other tasks. There was no evidence for impairments in EF or in processing global/local information, therefore contradicting these two theories. The implications of these results for these two theories are discussed.
16322174		Factors associated with age of diagnosis among children with autism spectrum disorders.	Pediatrics	2005	David S Mandell, Maytali M Novak, Cynthia D Zubritsky		Early diagnosis of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is critical but often delayed until school age. Few studies have identified factors that may delay diagnosis. This study attempted to identify these factors among a community sample of children with ASD.
16321884		Behavioural aspects of cerebellar function in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Cerebellum (London, England)	2005	Emma Gowen, R Chris Miall		Aside from social deficits, Asperger and autistic individuals also exhibit motor control abnormalities such as impaired gait, balance, manual dexterity and grip. One brain area that has consistently been reported on autopsy and imaging studies to be abnormal in such individuals is the cerebellum. As the cerebellum controls sensorimotor coordination and lesions here typically cause hypotonia, dysmetria and dyscoordination, we performed a series of quantitative tests aimed at investigating cerebellar function in Asperger individuals. Tests examining visually guided movement (rapid pointing), speeded complex movement (finger tapping, rapid hand turning), muscle tone (catching dropped weight), prediction, coordination and timing (balance, grip force and interval timing) were conducted on 12 Asperger subjects and 12 age and IQ matched controls. In comparison to control subjects, Asperger subject's demonstrated: (i) decreased pointing accuracy and rate, (ii) increased postural instability, and (iii) decreased timing accuracy. IQ was found to co-vary with some parameters of each of these tasks and no further impairments were found on the remaining tests. We suggest that these specific deficits reflect impairment in the ability to integrate sensory input with appropriate motor commands and are consistent with cerebellar dysfunction in Asperger syndrome.

Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2005	Takayuki Okada	National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Institute of Mental Health, Department of Forensic Psychiatry.	There had been argument concerning the difference between the agnostic approach and the gnostic approach to the psychiatric perspective of criminal responsibility until the landmark ruling by the 3rd court of the Japanese Supreme Court in 1984. The decision upheld the gnostic approach and affirmed that the defendant's criminal responsibility should be based on such factors as psychopathology, motive, modus operandi, situation surrounding the crime, and pre-morbid personality, as long as the offense was not directly motivated by the delusion or hallucination. The gnostic explanation includes so many various factors that the psychiatric testimony cannot easily be objective, while agnostic experts can find a conclusion about criminal responsibility only by psychiatric diagnosis. To establish a standard, the authors summarized the means of determination of criminal responsibility. The authors also discussed various topics related to criminal responsibility including Asperger's syndrome, illicit drug intoxication, and prescribed drug intoxication.
16301491		Perception of facial expression and facial identity in subjects with social developmental disorders.	Neurology	2005	Rebecca L Hefter, Dara S Manoach, Jason J S Barton		It has been hypothesized that the social dysfunction in social developmental disorders (SDDs), such as autism, Asperger disorder, and the socioemotional processing disorder, impairs the acquisition of normal face-processing skills. The authors investigated whether this purported perceptual deficit was generalized to both facial expression and facial identity or whether these different types of facial perception were dissociated in SDDs.

Psychopathology	2006	Pekka Tani, Nina Lindberg, Bjorn Appelberg, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen		Increasing public awareness of the adult manifestations of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders, like Asperger syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has provoked an increasing number of persons to seek assessment for the first time in adulthood. As these disorders have their origin in childhood, instruments for retrospective evaluation of childhood behavior are needed.
16287704		An 8 year follow-up of a specialist supported employment service for high-ability adults with autism or Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2005	Patricia Howlin, Jennifer Alcock, Catherine Burkin		Few supported employment programmes have been specifically designed for people with autism, especially those who are more able. This study examines the outcome of a supported employment service (NAS Prospects) for adults with autism or Asperger syndrome (IQ 60+) over an 8 year period. Approximately 68 percent of clients found employment. Of the 192 jobs, the majority were permanent contracts and most involved administrative, technical or computing work. Assessment of current clients indicates that IQ, language skills and educational attainments are high. However, work has also been found for those of lower abilities. Individuals supported by Prospects show a rise in salaries, contribute more tax and claim fewer benefits. Satisfaction with the scheme is high among clients, employers and support workers. Although the programme continues to incur a financial deficit, this has decreased. Moreover, there are many non-financial benefits, which are difficult to quantify. The importance of specialist employment support of this kind is discussed.
16287703		An experimental investigation of the phenomenology of delusional beliefs in people with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2005	Frances Abell, Dougal Julian Hare		There is evidence that Asperger syndrome is associated with delusional beliefs. Cognitive theories of delusions in psychosis literature propose a central role for impaired theory of mind ability in the development of delusions. The present study investigates the phenomenology of delusional ideation in Asperger syndrome. Fortysix individuals with Asperger syndrome participated and were found to have relatively high levels of delusional ideation, primarily grandiose or persecutory. Factors associated with delusional belief were anxiety, social anxiety and self-consciousness, but not theory of mind ability or autobiographical memory. The findings indicate that delusional belief is a prominent feature in Asperger syndrome, but do not support a mentalization based account. A preliminary cognitive model of delusions in Asperger syndrome is proposed and the theoretical and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

16272115		Sex differences in the brain: implications for explaining autism.	Science (New York, N.Y.)	2005	Simon Baron-Cohen, Rebecca C Knickmeyer, Matthew K Belmonte		"Empathizing is the capacity to predict and to respond to the behavior of agents (usually people) by inferring their mental states and responding to these with an appropriate emotion. Systemizing is the capacity to predict and to respond to the behavior of nonagentive deterministic systems by analyzing input-operation-output relations and inferring the rules that govern such systems. At a population level, females are stronger empathizers and males are stronger systemizers. The ""extreme male brain"" theory posits that autism represents an extreme of the male pattern (impaired empathizing and enhanced systemizing). Here we suggest that specific aspects of autistic neuroanatomy may also be extremes of typical male neuroanatomy."

Developmental neuropsychology	2005	Lauren E Kenworthy, David O Black, Gregory L Wallace, Taruna Ahluvalia, Ann E Wagner, Lisa M Sirian		Executive function (EF) abilities were investigated in 72 children with high-functioning autism (HFA) spectrum disorders through the collection of parent ratings and performance on laboratory measures of EF. In addition, discrepancy analysis was used to isolate executive functioning on tasks that carry multiple demands. Comparison of HFA and Asperger Disorder (AD) groups did not reveal consistent differences in EF. Results did indicate global EF deficits in the combined group of children with HFA and AD. Within the EF domain, specific deficits in flexibility and organization were most prominent.

21214596	doi: 10.1348/026151005X26840	Pitch perception in children with autistic spectrum disorders.	The British journal of developmental psychology	2005	Mareike Altgassen, Matthias Kliegel, Tim I Williams		This study investigated the accuracy of musical pitch detection in children with autistic spectrum disorders as compared with typically developing children. Seventeen children on the autistic spectrum (M(age) =9.34, SD(age) =1.12) and 13 typically developing, chronological age-matched children (M(age) =9.13, SD(age) =1.68) took part in the current study. Children were required to listen to four tones, which were paired with four different pictures and asked to learn the combinations. The children were then assessed for their ability to identify the previously learned tones, when they were presented as single tones and when they were embedded in chords and discords. No significant group differences were found. However, after subdividing the clinical group according to their diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndrome, the results indicated a slightly superior disembedding ability in participants with Asperger's syndrome. The findings are discussed in terms of the weak central coherence concept.
16246635		Autism and epilepsy: cause, consequence, comorbidity, or coincidence?	Epilepsy & behavior : E&B	2005	Lidia Gabis, John Pomeroy, Mary R Andriola		Autism is associated with epilepsy in early childhood, with evidence suggesting that individuals with both autism and more severe cognitive impairment are at higher risk. However, the incidence of an abnormal electroencephalogram and/or epilepsy in the full range of pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) is not well defined. This naturalistic study addresses the incidence of epilepsy and electroencephalographic abnormalities in children with PDDs. The clinical history and electroencephalograms of 56 children diagnosed with PDD-not otherwise specified, autism, or Asperger syndrome were retrospectively reviewed. Forty percent of children with autism were diagnosed with epilepsy. Abnormal electroencephalograms and epilepsy occurred at significantly higher rates in children in the more impaired range of the autism spectrum (P<0.05). These findings suggest that the use of neurological investigative techniques such as electroencephalography should be a consequence of careful clinical evaluation and should be considered routinely during evaluation of more impaired individuals.

Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)	2005	J Fleta Zaragozano, M Zapata Usábel, María J López Moreno, J L Olivares López		Asperger Syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder of unknown origin, characterized by pedantic language, lack of reciprocity in social interactions, unusual interests, motor clumsiness and normal or above average intelligence quotient, among other symptoms. Since 1994 it has been defined as a specific entity. We describe the case of a boy with this syndrome, with elevated body weight and height and sexual identity disorder. These alterations have not previously been described in the scientific literature on Asperger syndrome.

The problems of some of these children may stem from pragmatic difficulties in communication. This paper reports the results of a study on the use of checklists in professional practice to assist in the identification of these difficulties.
16189507		A heterogeneity-based genome search meta-analysis for autism-spectrum disorders.	Molecular psychiatry	2006	T A Trikalinos, A Karvouni, E Zintzaras, T Ylisaukko-oja, L Peltonen, I Järvelä, J P A Ioannidis		Autism and autism-spectrum disorders exhibit high heritability, although specific susceptibility genes still remain largely elusive. We performed a heterogeneity-based genome search meta-analysis (HEGESMA) of nine genome scans on autism or autism-spectrum disorders. Each genome scan was separated in 30 cM bins and the maximum linkage statistic from each bin was ranked. Significance for each bin's average rank and for between-scan heterogeneity (dis-similarity in the average ranks) was obtained through Monte Carlo tests. For autism, data from 771 affected sibpairs were synthesized across six separate genome scans. Region 7q22-q32 reached genome-wide significance both in weighted and unweighted analyses, with evidence for significantly low between-scan heterogeneity. The flanking chromosomal region 7q32-qter reached the less stringent threshold of suggestive significance, with no evidence for low between-scan heterogeneity. For autism-spectrum disorders (634 affected sibpairs from five separate scans), no chromosomal region reached genome-wide significance. However, suggestive significance was reached for the chromosomal regions 17p11.2-q12 and 10p12-q11.1 in weighted analyses. There was evidence for significantly high between-scan heterogeneity for the former region. The meta-analysis suggests that the 7q22-q32 region should be further scrutinized for autism susceptibility genes, while autism-spectrum disorders seem to have quite diverse linkage signals across scans, possibly suggesting genetic heterogeneity across subsyndromes and subpopulations.
16186206		Asperger's disorder and murder.	The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law	2005	Donna M Schwartz-Watts	University of South Carolina School of Medicine, 15 Medical Park, Suite 102, Columbia, SC, USA. donnasw@gw.mp.sc.edu	Little is known about the prevalence of violence and autistic spectrum disorders. This article reviews findings of current research on Asperger's disorder and violence. Criteria for diagnosing Asperger's disorder are given. Three cases are presented in which defendants with diagnosed Asperger's disorder were charged with murder. Specific symptoms in this disorder are discussed as they relate to issues of diminished capacity and criminal responsibility.
16182941		Autism and Asperger's disorder: are they movement disorders involving the cerebellum and/or basal ganglia?	Brain research bulletin	2005	Ashwini Nayate, John L Bradshaw, Nicole J Rinehart		Autism and Asperger's disorder (AD) are childhood developmental disorders of unknown aetiology. Autism and AD share several behavioural features, and it is not clear whether they are distinct disorders or variants of the same disorder. Recent studies indicate that disordered movement may be another feature of autism and AD, and that this may reflect dysfunction within the frontostriatal and/or cerebellar motor circuits. While disordered movement in autism and AD has been examined in a variety of ways, it is relatively under-researched compared to the cognitive, affective, and behavioural disturbances seen in these disorders. This review examines the role of the frontostriatal and cerebellar motor systems in the behavioural features of autism and AD, with gait as a proxy, and discusses difficulties with their diagnosis and their possible pathogenesis.
16172701		Laboratorial diagnosis of fragile-X syndrome: experience in a sample of individuals with pervasive developmental disorders.	Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria	2005	Carlos Eduardo Steiner, Marilisa Mantovani Guerreiro, Antonia Paula Marques-de-Faria, Iscia Lopes-Cendes		Fragile X syndrome is a frequent genetic disease associated to developmental disorders, including learning disability, mental retardation, behavioral problems and pervasive developmental disorders (autism and related conditions). We studied a sample of 82 individuals (69 males and 13 females) presenting with pervasive developmental disorders using three techniques for the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome (FXS). Cytogenetic analysis detected the fragile site in four males, but only one showed a consistent positive rate. Molecular study based on the PCR technique was inconclusive for most females (92.3%), which where latter submitted to Southern blotting analysis, and for one male (1.4%), excluding the FRAXA mutation in the remaining male individuals (98.6%). Molecular tests using the Southern blotting technique confirmed only one positive case (1.2%) in a male subject. These results showed that Southern blotting analysis of the FRAXA mutation has the best sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of FXS but also validated the PCR technique as a confinable screening test.

16155853		Social competence in children with language impairment: making connections.	Seminars in speech and language	2005	Bonnie Brinton, Martin Fujiki		Children with language problems frequently experience social difficulty. This is the case not only for children diagnosed as having impairments such as autism spectrum disorder, Asperger syndrome (AS), or mental retardation but also for children falling into diagnostic categories traditionally considered to be primarily language based (e.g., language impairment, learning disability). In considering what interventions might be most effective, it is important to consider how various aspects of development are connected. This article describes causal networks in which various factors influence the relationship between language deficits and social difficulties. Case descriptions of Joseph, an adolescent with language impairment, and Cari, a 6-year-old diagnosed with AS, illustrate the complexity of this relationship and demonstrate how intervention might be designed to facilitate positive social communication outcomes.
16145276		Mutually exclusive versus co-occurring diagnostic categories: the challenge of diagnostic comorbidity.	Psychopathology	2005	Michael B First	Clinical Psychiatry, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, NY, USA. mbf2@columbia.edu	Diagnostic comorbidity is the rule rather than the exception in both DSM-IV and ICD-10. Three types of comorbidity include true comorbidity (clinically distinct entities), artifactual comorbidity (a byproduct of the DSM/ICD strategy to split categorical diagnoses) and spurious comorbidity. DSM has established 'mutually exclusive' relationships between disorders to reduce such spurious comorbidity. Four types of mutually exclusive relationships are identified: (1) between disorders that are on different levels of the Kraepelinian-defined hierarchy (e.g., schizophrenia and major depressive disorder); (2) between categories with identical features that are split according to age or duration (schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder); (3) between categories in which the defining features of one disorder are contained in the definition of more broadly-defined disorder (Asperger's disorder and autistic disorder), and (4) between categories in which the defining features of one disorder are an associated feature of another disorder (e.g., dysthymic disorder and schizophrenia). Although less comorbidity may be desirable to reduce diagnostic complexity, in the absence of knowledge about underlying pathophysiology, the trend in successive editions of the DSM has been to reduce diagnostic hierarchies and increase comorbidity (e.g., elimination of exclusion between panic disorder and major depression in DSM-III-R because of evidence of independence). It is important to understand that comorbidity in psychiatry does not imply the presence of multiple diseases or dysfunctions but rather reflects our current inability to apply Occam's razor (i.e., a single diagnosis to account for all symptoms).
16140346		Neural mechanisms of imitation and 'mirror neuron' functioning in autistic spectrum disorder.	Neuropsychologia	2006	Justin H G Williams, Gordon D Waiter, Anne Gilchrist, David I Perrett, Alison D Murray, Andrew Whiten		An association between autistic spectrum disorder and imitative impairment might result from dysfunction in mirror neurons (MNs) that serve to relate observed actions to motor codings. To explore this hypothesis, we employed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol previously used to identify the neural substrate of imitation, and human MN function, to compare 16 adolescent males of normal intelligence with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) and age, sex and IQ matched controls. In the control group, in accord with previous findings, we identified activity attributable to MNs in areas of the right parietal lobe. Activity in this area was less extensive in the ASD group and was absent during non-imitative action execution. Broca's area was minimally active during imitation in controls. Differential patterns of activity during imitation and action observation in ASD and controls were most evident in an area at the right temporo-parietal junction also associated with a 'theory of mind' (ToM) function. ASD participants also failed to show modulation of left amygdala activity during imitation that was evident in the controls. This may have implications for understanding the imitation of emotional stimuli in ASD. Overall, we suggest that ASD is associated with altered patterns of brain activity during imitation, which could stem from poor integration between areas serving visual, motor, proprioceptive and emotional functions. Such poor integration is likely to adversely affect the development of ToM through imitation as well as other aspects of social cognitive function in ASD.
16134029		How do individuals with Asperger syndrome respond to nonliteral language and inappropriate requests in computer-mediated communication?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Gnanathusharan Rajendran, Peter Mitchell, Hugh Rickards		Computer-mediated communication in individuals with Asperger syndrome, Tourette syndrome and normal controls was explored with a program called Bubble Dialogue (Gray, Creighton, McMahon, and Cunninghamn (1991)) in which the users type text into speech bubbles. Two scenarios, based on Happé (1994) were adapted to investigate understanding of figure of speech and sarcasm, and a third, developed by ourselves, looked at responses to inappropriate requests (lending money and disclosing home address on a first meeting). Dialogue transcripts were assessed by 62 raters who were blind to the clinical diagnoses. Hierarchical linear modelling revealed that rated understanding of a figure of speech was predicted mainly by verbal ability and executive ability, as well as by clinical diagnosis, whereas handling inappropriate requests was predicted by age, verbal ability, executive ability and diagnosis. Notably, the Tourette comparison group showed better understanding than the Asperger group in interpreting a figure of speech and handling inappropriate requests, and differences between these groups were possibly attributable to individual differences in executive ability. In contrast, understanding sarcasm was predicted by age but not by either verbal ability, executive ability or clinical diagnosis. Evidently, there is a complicated relation between Asperger syndrome, verbal ability and executive abilities with respect to communicative performance.

16119474		Screening adults for Asperger Syndrome using the AQ: a preliminary study of its diagnostic validity in clinical practice.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	M R Woodbury-Smith, J Robinson, S Wheelwright, S Baron-Cohen		The Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) has been developed to measure the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has autistic traits. In this paper it is evaluated for its potential as a screening questionnaire in clinical practice on one hundred consecutive referrals to a diagnostic clinic for adults suspected of having Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism (AS/HFA). The results indicate that it has good discriminative validity and good screening properties at a threshold score of 26. The implications of these results are discussed.
16119472		Characteristics of children with autistic spectrum disorders served in comprehensive community-based mental health settings.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	David S Mandell, Christine M Walrath, Brigitte Manteuffel, Gina Sgro, Jennifer Pinto-Martin		This study describes the characteristics of children with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) receiving treatment in community mental health settings. Data from a national community mental health initiative was used to identify children who had received a primary diagnosis of ASD. These children were compared with children with other diagnoses on socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics, presenting problems and service histories. Regardless of diagnosis, children were most often referred to service because of disruptive behaviors. Children with ASD were less likely to be referred for drug use, truancy or running away, but were more likely to be referred for social interaction difficulties and strange behavior. Many children had family histories of mental illness, substance abuse and domestic violence. Implications of these findings are discussed in detail.
16115221		Similarities in the phenotype of the auditory neural substrate in children with Asperger syndrome and their parents.	The European journal of neuroscience	2005	E Jansson-Verkasalo, T Kujala, K Jussila, M L Mattila, I Moilanen, R Näätänen, K Suominen, P Korpilahti		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a developmental disorder of brain function characterized by deficits in social interaction including difficulties in understanding emotional expressions. Children with AS share some of the behavioural characteristics with their parents and AS seems to run particularly in the male members of the same families. The aim of the present study was to determine whether similarities could be found between children with AS and their parents at central auditory processing. It was found that in children with AS the sound encoding, as reflected by the exogenous components of event-related potentials, was similarly abnormal as in both their mothers and fathers. However, their abnormal cortical auditory discrimination, as indexed by the prolonged latency of the mismatch negativity, resembled that of their fathers but not that of their mothers. The present results suggest that complex genetic mechanisms may contribute to auditory abnormalities encountered in children with AS.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2005	Marlene Briciet Lauritsen, Carsten Bøcker Pedersen, Preben Bo Mortensen		The etiology of autism is unknown.

16108456		Characteristics of fetal anticonvulsant syndrome associated autistic disorder.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2005	A D Rasalam, H Hailey, J H G Williams, S J Moore, P D Turnpenny, D J Lloyd, J C S Dean		The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features and frequency of autistic disorder or Asperger syndrome (AS; according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [DSM-IV] criteria) in children exposed to anticonvulsant medication in utero. During a 20-year study period, 626 children were born in Aberdeen to mothers taking antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The study examined long-term effects of prenatal exposure to AEDs in 260 children (122 males, 138 females). Of these, 26 (16 males) were reported by parents to have social or behavioural difficulties. Eleven children (6 males, 5 females) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder and one (female) fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for AS. These children comprised 4.6% of the exposed children studied, and 1.9% of all exposed children born during the study period. Mean age of these children at diagnosis was 5 years 4 months (SD 2y 11mo) and 9 years 10 months (SD 3y 10mo) at the time of this study. Other children from the group of 26 had difficulties in areas of speech and language development and social communication but did not meet the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Sodium valproate was the drug most commonly associated with autistic disorder, five of 56 (8.9%) of the study children exposed to sodium valproate alone had either autistic disorder or AS. It was concluded that prenatal exposure to anticonvulsant medication is a risk factor for the development of an ASD.

16092912		The presentation of anxiety in children with pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2005	Deborah M Weisbrot, Kenneth D Gadow, Carla J DeVincent, John Pomeroy		Although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria generally discourage the diagnosis of other Axis I disorders in children with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), anxiety symptoms are often observed in this clinical population. Moreover, there are some albeit limited data that suggest an association between anxiety and psychotic symptoms in children. Because co-occurring psychiatric symptoms have important clinical implications, this study examined anxiety and psychotic symptoms in children with and without PDD.
16089250		Managing autism and Asperger's syndrome in current educational provision.	Pediatric rehabilitation	2005	R Jordan	School of Education, University of Birmingham, Birmingham B15 2TT, UK. r.r.jordan@bham.ac.uk	There is a need to understand the difficulties faced by those with autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) in educational settings if one is to manage and help them manage their learning. This paper explores some of the most pertinent problems that arise. It analyses perceptual, social, conceptual, emotional and memorizing barriers to learning and shows how difficulties in communication are exacerbated by educational language, which gives a poor model for those who have no prior understanding of inter-personal communication. The notion of an 'autism-friendly' environment is examined as is the process of how schools and other learning institutions might be helped to create such an environment. Education as entitlement is distinguished from education as therapy and the implications for inclusion are examined. It is argued that the best teaching arises from an empathetic understanding and a willingness to be flexible, the worst, from rigidity and an expectation that it is the child who must change. There is no single approach that can meet all the needs of those with ASDs, but nor are needs entirely determined by individual behaviour. It is the understanding of ASD that enables the teacher to correctly identify the child's learning needs and begin to meet them.

16083327		Autism spectrum disorders: emerging pharmacotherapy.	Expert opinion on emerging drugs	2005	Jeff Q Bostic, Bryan H King		Autism, Asperger and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) are an increasingly commonly identified group of conditions wherein patients experience significant difficulty in social interactions, communicating with others, and inflexible adherence to unusual, unhelpful and frequently stereotyped routines and behaviour. These autism spectrum disorders are now being diagnosed earlier in life (approximately 15 months), and often remain a chronic, daily burden for those afflicted. In addition to the often profound impact on an individual's quality of life, the familial, social and economic burdens of PDDs can be enormous. No treatments are curative, and most pharmacological treatments are employed to treat specific troubling symptoms rather than the core features of the disorder itself. Therefore, more effective pharmacotherapies are desperately needed. This review describes current and emerging pharmacotherapies that may advance care of people with PDDs.

Vertex (Buenos Aires, Argentina)	2005	Ernesto Wahlberg	Centro ICID Investigación en Ciencias del Desarrollo y del CAITI Centro educativo terapéutico para niños y jóvenes con austismo, Buenos Aires. ewahlberg@uolsinectis.com.ar	Asperger syndrome (A.S) is not a very well-known disorder due to its recent incorporation to the international nosography of mental disorders during the early 90s. The intention of this article is to describe the clinical picture with its symptomatic diversity. It will show how the diagnostic criteria were developed since the presentation by Asperger in 1944, to the classification consensed nowadays. It also presents the situations in which this diagnosis is most frequent to facilitate its detection and to permit a more extensive assessment leading to a more accurate treatment.

16009478		The neurophysiological correlates of face processing in adults and children with Asperger's syndrome.	Brain and cognition	2005	Kate O'Connor, Jeff P Hamm, Ian J Kirk		Past research has found evidence for face and emotional expression processing differences between individuals with Asperger's syndrome (AS) and neurotypical (NT) controls at both the neurological and behavioural levels. The aim of the present study was to examine the neurophysiological basis of emotional expression processing in children and adults with AS relative to age- and gender-matched NT controls. High-density event-related potentials were recorded during explicit processing of happy, sad, angry, scared, and neutral faces. Adults with AS were found to exhibit delayed P1 and N170 latencies and smaller N170 amplitudes in comparison to control subjects for all expressions. This may reflect impaired holistic and configural processing of faces in AS adults. However, these differences were not observed between AS and control children. This may result from incomplete development of the neuronal generators of these ERP components and/or early intervention.
15996486		Egocentrism, allocentrism, and Asperger syndrome.	Consciousness and cognition	2005	Uta Frith, Frederique de Vignemont		"In this paper, we attempt to make a distinction between egocentrism and allocentrism in social cognition, based on the distinction that is made in visuo-spatial perception. We propose that it makes a difference to mentalizing whether the other person can be understood using an egocentric (""you"") or an allocentric (""he/she/they"") stance. Within an egocentric stance, the other person is represented in relation to the self. By contrast, within an allocentric stance, the existence or mental state of the other person needs to be represented as independent from the self. We suggest here that people with Asperger syndrome suffer from a disconnection between a strong naïve egocentric stance and a highly abstract allocentric stance. We argue that the currently used distinction between first-person and third-person perspective-taking is orthogonal to the distinction between an egocentric and an allocentric stance and therefore cannot serve as a critical test of allocentrism."

European child & adolescent psychiatry	2005	Bernd Kraemer, Aba Delsignore, Ronnie Gundelfinger, Ulrich Schnyder, Urs Hepp		The case of a 35-year-old biological woman with Asperger syndrome (AS) and gender identity disorder (GID) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria is reported. Against the background of recently emerging theories of cognitive male pattern underlying autism we present additional psychological assessments in order to discuss any possible interaction or discrimination between AS and GID. Whilst we explain GID as a secondary feature of AS, we examine the assumption of the necessity of treating GID in AS as a primary GID in accordance with international standards. We consider the treatment of GID as compelling, particularly because curative therapy for AS is lacking and with GID treatment in this vein, the patient gains psychosocial improvement.

15909409		Asperger's syndrome: a comparison of clinical diagnoses and those made according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Marc Woodbury-Smith, Ami Klin, Fred Volkmar		The diagnostic criteria for Asperger Syndrome (AS) according to ICD-10 and DSM-IV have been criticized as being too narrow in view of the rules of onset and precedence, whereby autism takes precedence over AS in a diagnostic hierarchy. In order to investigate this further, cases from the DSM-IV multicenter study who had been diagnosed clinically with AS were assigned to appropriate DSM-IV/ICD-10 diagnostic categories. The analysis indicated that 11(23%) cases would be reassigned a diagnosis of autism by either ICD-10 or DSM-IV according to their onset and precedence rules, and 33(68%) would be diagnosed with AS. These results contrast with those of others who have stated that the diagnosis of AS using ICD-10/DSM-IV criteria is 'virtually impossible'. It is suggested that this is due to limitations inherent in these criteria, and alternative conceptualizations are discussed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Lorna Wing	National Autistic Society Centre for Social and Communication Disorders, Elliot House, 113 Masons Hill, Bromley, Kent, BR2 9HT, UK. lgwing@aol.com	Publishing my paper on Asperger's syndrome in 1981, and suggesting that it is part of the autistic spectrum, has had various consequences. These include the growth of interest in the syndrome among the general public as well as professionals. Controversy over definitions of subgroups and prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders has increased. Adult psychiatrists are becoming aware that high functioning autistic disorders can underlie psychiatric conditions. Naming the condition has helped many with the syndrome to greater understanding of their skills and disabilities. It has highlighted the special contribution people with Asperger syndrome have made to the world. There has been a growth of specialist services but many more are needed. Describing and naming the syndrome has had mainly positive effects.
15909405		Laterality biases to chimeric faces in Asperger syndrome: what is 'right' about face-processing?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Chris Ashwin, Sally Wheelwright, Simon Baron-Cohen		People show a left visual field (LVF) bias for faces, i.e., involving the right hemisphere of the brain. Lesion and neuroimaging studies confirm the importance of the right-hemisphere and suggest separable neural pathways for processing facial identity vs. emotions. We investigated the hemispheric processing of faces in adults with and without Asperger syndrome (AS) using facial emotion and identity chimeric tasks. Controls showed an LVF bias in both tasks, but no perceptual bias in a non-social control task. The AS group showed an LVF bias during both tasks, however the bias was reduced in the identity condition. Further, the AS group showed an LVF bias in the non-social condition. These results show a differential pattern of hemispheric processing of faces in AS.
15909404		A family history study of Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Mohammad Ghaziuddin	Division of Child Psychiatry, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0277, USA. mghaziud@umich.edu	Asperger syndrome (AS) is a childhood-onset disorder often described as a mild variant of autism. Although classified as a distinct disorder in the DSM-IV, its overlap with autism continues to be a matter of ongoing debate. While the family genetic origins of autism are well established, few studies have investigated this topic in AS using current operational criteria. In this report, we examined the family psychiatric history of 58 subjects with AS diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria (48 males; mean age 13.34; mean full scale IQ 104.87). All subjects had a history of mild autistic social deficits; focused special interests; normal level of intelligence; and an odd and often pedantic manner of speaking. None had a previous diagnosis of autism. Of the 58 subjects with Asperger syndrome, three had first degree relatives with AS; nine (15%) had a family history of schizophrenia; and 35 (60%) had a family history of depression. Of the 64 siblings, four had a diagnosis of AS and none of autism. Compared with a group of 39 subjects with normal intelligence autism (high functioning autism, HFA; 33 males; mean age 15.34; mean full scale IQ 85.89) subjects with AS were more likely to have relatives with depression; schizophrenia; and the broader autistic phenotype. Possible reasons for and implications of these findings are discussed.
15909403		Can a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome be made in very young children with suspected autism spectrum disorder?	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Helen McConachie, Ann Le Couteur, Emma Honey		Of a cohort of 104 children with Autism, PDD-NOS or specific language disorder, recruited at age 2-3 years of age, only three appeared to meet diagnostic assessment criteria for Asperger syndrome (AS). The children were followed up at 4-5 years, and assessments at both time points included the Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R), the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning. The paper explores the reasons why so few children with possible AS were identified early, including problems inherent in the assessment tools and the range of normal variation within characteristics required for a diagnosis. Only 10 children altogether had first words by 24 months, and abilities in the average range, and 9 were followed up. All of these able children had varied repetitive behaviours, and these increased in terms of ADI-R algorithm score over a 13 month interval. However, items concerning resistance to change and liking of routines tended to decrease in terms of reported impact on the child and family. Repetitive behaviours seem significant in the early referral of able children for a PDD diagnosis, but identification of children with AS is more likely to occur reliably once children are older and enter school.

15909401		Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Mikle South, Sally Ozonoff, William M McMahon		Although repetitive behaviors are a core diagnostic domain for autism spectrum disorders, research in this area has been neglected. This study had two major aims: (1) to provide a detailed characterization of repetitive behaviors in individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS), high-functioning autism (HFA), and typically developing controls (TD); and (2) to examine whether differences in repetitive behavior profiles could provide evidence for the external validity of AS separate from HFA. Specifically, it was hypothesized that circumscribed interests would be more prevalent and cause more impairment in the AS group than the HFA group, while the reverse would be true for other categories of repetitive behavior. The parent(s) of 61 children and adolescents (19 with AS, 21 with HFA, and 21 TD) completed two interviews focused specifically on lifetime and current repetitive behavior symptoms. No reliable differences in repetitive behavior between AS and HFA children were found. Results suggested that circumscribed interests differ in developmental course from the three other DSM-IV-TR categories of repetitive behavior. Internal consistency among the four DSM-IV-TR categories of repetitive behavior was high, alpha = .84, providing evidence for a unitary repetitive behaviors factor. The importance of expanding research in the repetitive behavior domain is highlighted as part of the necessary integration of behavioral and neurobiological approaches to understanding the etiology of autism.
15905639		The long-term outcome in two females with autism spectrum disorder.	Psychopathology	2005	Sven Bölte, Gerhard Bosch		We describe the results of a long-term follow-up examination of two adult females diagnosed exhibiting an autism spectrum disorder in childhood. Over four decades after the initial diagnosis made by Gerhard Bosch, besides Leo Kanner and Hans Asperger, one of the first clinicians to describe cases of autistic behavior, the individuals had largely different psychiatric outcomes. Despite the fact that both females continuously showed definite autistic traits, one woman exhibited a generalized anxiety disorder, while the other was predominantly characterized by schizoaffective symptoms. The trajectories of the two cases are discussed in the light of research on possible associations and overlaps between autism spectrum disorders, psychosis and anxiety disorders. It is suggested that adult outcome studies in autism should consider a broader range of comorbidity.

15885908		Neurophysiological evidence for cortical discrimination impairment of prosody in Asperger syndrome.	Neuroscience letters	2005	T Kujala, T Lepistö, T Nieminen-von Wendt, P Näätänen, R Näätänen		Asperger syndrome (AS), belonging to the autism spectrum of disorders, is one of the pervasive developmental disorders. Individuals with AS usually have normal development of formal speech but pronounced problems in perceiving and producing speech prosody. The present study addressed the discrimination of speech prosody in AS by recording the mismatch negativity (MMN) and behavioural responses to natural utterances with different emotional connotations. MMN responses were abnormal in the adults with AS in several ways. In these subjects, fewer significantly elicited MMNs, diminished MMN amplitudes, as well as prolonged latencies were found. In addition, the MMN generator loci differed between the subjects with AS and control subjects. These findings were predominant over the right cerebral hemisphere. These results show impaired neurobiological basis for speech-prosody processing at an early, pre-attentive auditory discrimination stage in AS.
15877770		The prototype effect in recognition memory: intact in autism?	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2005	Catherine J Molesworth, Dermot M Bowler, James A Hampton		There are two accounts of categorization performance in autism: that there is an impairment in prototype formation (Klinger & Dawson, 2001) and that there is an impairment in processing features held in common between stimuli (Plaisted, O'Riordan, & Baron-Cohen, 1998). These accounts, together with central coherence theory (Frith, 1989; Frith & Happé, 1994), imply a reduced or absent prototype effect in autism.
15867978		Secondary tics and tourettism.	Revista brasileira de psiquiatria (Sao Paulo, Brazil : 1999)	2005	Nicte I Mejia, Joseph Jankovic		Motor and phonic tics are most frequently due to Tourette syndrome, but there are many other causes of tics. We analyzed data on 155 patients with tics and co-existent disorders (101M/54F; mean age 40.5 +/- 20.2 years). Fourteen (9.0%) patients had tics associated with an insult to the basal ganglia, such as head trauma (N = 4, 2.5%), stroke (N = 2, 1.2%), encephalitis (N = 3, 1.9%) and other causes. In addition, certain drugs, toxins, and post-infectious causes were associated with tics. Rarely, peripheral injury can cause movement disorders, including tics (N = 1, 0.6%). Pervasive developmental disorders, including Asperger's syndrome (N = 13, 8.3%), mental retardation (N = 4, 2.5%), autism (N = 3, 1.9%), and Savant's syndrome (N = 1, 0.6%), also may be associated with tics, as noted in 21 of the 155 patients (13.5%). Genetic and chromosomal disorders, such as Down's syndrome 5 (3.2%), neuroacanthocytosis (N = 2, 1.2%), and Huntington's disease (N = 1, 0.6%), were associated with tics in 16 patients (10.3%). We have also examined the co-existence of tics and other movement disorders such as dystonia (N = 31, 20.0%) and essential tremor (N = 17, 10.9%). Sixteen (10.3%) patients presented psychogenic tics, and one (0.6%) psychogenic tics and dystonia; conversely, Tourette syndrome preceded the onset of psychogenic dystonia (N = 1, 0.6%), and psychogenic tremor (N = 1, 0.6%) in two patients. Finally, 12 (7.7%) patients had tics in association with non-movement related neurological disorders, such as static encephalopathy (N = 2, 1.2%) and seizures (N = 3, 1.9%). To understand the physiopathology of tics and Tourette syndrome, it is important to recognize that these may be caused or associated with other disorders.

15857862		Adjustment in mothers of children with Asperger syndrome: an application of the double ABCX model of family adjustment.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2005	Kenneth I Pakenham, Christina Samios, Kate Sofronoff		The present study examined the applicability of the double ABCX model of family adjustment in explaining maternal adjustment to caring for a child diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Forty-seven mothers completed questionnaires at a university clinic while their children were participating in an anxiety intervention. The children were aged between 10 and 12 years. Results of correlations showed that each of the model components was related to one or more domains of maternal adjustment in the direction predicted, with the exception of problem-focused coping. Hierarchical regression analyses demonstrated that, after controlling for the effects of relevant demographics, stressor severity, pile-up of demands and coping were related to adjustment. Findings indicate the utility of the double ABCX model in guiding research into parental adjustment when caring for a child with Asperger syndrome. Limitations of the study and clinical implications are discussed.
15843103		Executive functions in autism and Asperger's disorder: flexibility, fluency, and inhibition.	Developmental neuropsychology	2005	Natalia Kleinhans, Natacha Akshoomoff, Dean C Delis		The Color-Word Interference Test, Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test, and Design Fluency Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (Delis, Kaplan, & Kramer, 2001) were administered to 12 high-functioning adults and adolescents with autistic disorder or Asperger's disorder. Each test included a switching condition in addition to baseline and/or other executive-function conditions. Participants performed significantly below average on a composite measure of executive functioning adjusted for baseline cognitive ability. Complex verbal tasks that required cognitive switching and initiation of efficient lexical retrieval strategies produced the most consistent deficits, whereas cognitive inhibition was intact. We discuss implications of these findings for understanding the neurocognitive substrates of autistic spectrum disorders.

15823169		Actigraphic assessment of sleep in young adults with Asperger syndrome.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2005	Pekka Tani, Nina Lindberg, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Lauri Alanko, Björn Appelberg, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen		A high prevalence of subjective insomnia in adults with Asperger syndrome has been reported. In the present study the sleep quality of these patients was studied using wrist actigraphy. Nineteen adults with Asperger syndrome and frequent feelings of insomnia were compared with 10 controls devoid of neuropsychiatric disorders and subjective sleep problems during six consecutive nights. The patients had similar actigraphic sleep profile to the controls. The subjective low sleep quality in patients was not reflected in actigraphic assessment of sleep. This finding suggests that pervasive anxiety inherent in persons with Asperger syndrome predisposes them to insomnia complaints.

15813671		What is known about autism: genes, brain, and behavior.	American journal of pharmacogenomics : genomics-related research in drug development and clinical practice	2005	Susan L Santangelo, Katherine Tsatsanis		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of genetic origins, with a heritability of about 90%. Autistic disorder is classed within the broad domain of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) that also includes Rett syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, Asperger syndrome, and PDD not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). Prevalence estimates suggest a rate of 0.1-0.2% for autism and 0.6% for the range of PDD disorders. There is considerable phenotypic heterogeneity within this class of disorders as well as continued debate regarding their clinical boundaries. Autism is the prototypical PDD, and is characterized by impairments in three core domains: social interaction, language development, and patterns of behavior (restricted and stereotyped). Clinical pattern and severity of impairment vary along these dimensions, and the level of cognitive functioning of individuals with autism spans the entire range, from profound mental retardation to superior intellect. There is no single biological or clinical marker for autism, nor is it expected that a single gene is responsible for its expression; as many as 15+ genes may be involved. However, environmental influences are also important, as concordance in monozygotic twins is less than 100% and the phenotypic expression of the disorder varies widely, even within monozygotic twins. Multiple susceptibility factors are being explored using varied methodologies, including genome-wide linkage studies, and family- and case-control candidate gene association studies. This paper reviews what is currently known about the genetic and environmental risk factors, neuropathology, and psychopharmacology of autism. Discussion of genetic factors focuses on the findings from linkage and association studies, the results of which have implicated the involvement of nearly every chromosome in the human genome. However, the most consistently replicated linkage findings have been on chromosome 7q, 2q, and 15q. The positive associations from candidate gene studies are largely unreplicated, with the possible exceptions of the GABRB3 and serotonin transporter genes. No single region of the brain or pathophysiological mechanism has yet been identified as being associated with autism. Postmortem findings, animal models, and neuroimaging studies have focused on the cerebellum, frontal cortex, hippocampus, and especially the amygdala. The cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit may also be influential in autism. There is evidence that overall brain size is increased in some individuals with autism. Presently there are no drugs that produce major improvements in the core social or pragmatic language deficits in autism, although several have limited effects on associated behavioral features. The application of new techniques in autism research is being proposed, including the investigation of abnormal regulation of gene expression, proteomics, and the use of MRI and postmortem analysis of the brain.

15796119		Diagnostic assessment of Asperger's disorder: a review of five third-party rating scales.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2005	Jonathan M Campbell	Department of Educational Psychology, The University of Georgia, 329 Aderhold Hall, Athens, GA 30602-7143, USA. jcampbel@coe.uga.edu	Five rating scales for screening and detection of Asperger's Disorder, three commercially available and two research instruments, are evaluated with reference to psychometric criteria outlined by Bracken in 1987 (Journal of Psychoeducational Assessment, 4, 313). Reliability and validity data reported in examiner's manuals or published reports are reviewed. The scales included in the review are the Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (ASDS), Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ), Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST), Gilliam Asperger's Disorder Scale (GADS), and Krug Asperger's Disorder Index (KADI). All published rating scales demonstrated significant weaknesses, particularly in the use of questionable normative samples. Among the published instruments, the KADI appears to be the most sound in terms of reliability and validity. The research instruments present incomplete psychometric data to date, but hold promise as clinical instruments.
15793686		The Strange Stories test--a replication study of children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2005	Nils Kaland, Annette Møller-Nielsen, Lars Smith, Erik Lykke Mortensen, Kirsten Callesen, Dorte Gottlieb		The aim of the present study was to assess the ability of 21 children and adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS) of normal intelligence to infer mental states in a story context using Happe's Strange Stories test. The participants in the AS group were compared with an age-matched control group (N=20) of normally developing children and adolescents on a test of social understanding. The test material comprised social communication such as Pretence, Joke, Lie, White Lie, Figure of Speech, Misunderstanding, Persuasion, Irony, Double Bluff and Contrary Emotions, Appearance/Reality and Forgetting. As compared to the controls, the participants in the AS group performed less well on these tasks, and answered fewer correct mental state inferences, but performed well on a physical state control task. This study supports the main finding of earlier studies, showing that even individuals with AS of normal intelligence have problems in using mental state terms context-appropriately when tested on the Strange Stories test.

Revista de neurologia	2005	M Palau-Baduell, B Salvadó-Salvadó, A Valls-Santasusana, T Ortiz, J A Muñoz-Yunta		Autism spectrum disorders cover a continuum of disorders ranging from severe autism to mild autism and Asperger's syndrome. They are considered to be a subgroup of the pervasive development disorders and are characterised by the alteration of three basic areas of behaviour, qualitative alterations in reciprocal social interaction, qualitative alterations in communication and patterns of behaviour, and stereotyped, repetitive and restrictive activities and interests. These alterations are expressed to a greater or lesser degree depending on the level of severity of the disorder and can be detected and quantified by clinical instruments such as the ADI-R (Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised) and the CARS (Childhood Autism Rating Scale). AIMS. Our aim was to establish a relationship between the specific behavioural characteristics of autism (evaluated by ADI-R and CARS) and brain structures and functions.

15729132		Magnetoencephalography identifies rapid temporal processing deficit in autism and language impairment.	Neuroreport	2005	Janis E Oram Cardy, Elissa J Flagg, Wendy Roberts, Jessica Brian, Timothy P L Roberts		Deficient rapid temporal processing may contribute to impaired language development by interfering with the processing of brief acoustic transitions crucial for speech perception. Using magnetoencephalography, evoked neural activity (M50, M100) to two 40 ms tones passively presented in rapid succession was recorded in 10 neurologically normal adults and 40 8-17-year-olds with autism, specific language impairment, Asperger syndrome or typical development. While 80% of study participants with intact language (Asperger syndrome, typical development, adults) showed identifiable responses to the second tone, which presented rapid temporal processing demands, 65% of study participants with impaired language (autism, specific language impairment) did not, despite having shown identifiable responses to the first tone. Rapid temporal processing impairments may be fundamentally associated with impairments in language rather than autism spectrum disorder.

15724518		[The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) Japanese version: evidence from high-functioning clinical group and normal adults].	Shinrigaku kenkyu : The Japanese journal of psychology	2004	Akio Wakabayashi, Yoshikuni Tojo, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright		Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Skinner, Martin, and Clubley (2001) constructed brief, self-administered instruments named the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ), for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a Japanese version of this new instrument. Three groups of Japanese subjects were assessed. Group 1 (n = 57) consisted of adults with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA). The other two groups were control groups. Subjects of Group 2 (n = 194) were normal adults and those of Group 3 (n = 1 050) were students selected from five Universities in Tokyo and Chiba. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 37.9 (SD = 5.31), which was significantly higher than the two control groups (Group 2: X = 18.5, SD = 6.21, and Group 3: X = 20.7, SD = 6.38). While eighty-eight percent of the adults with AS/HFA scored more than 33 points, only 3% of subjects in the two control groups indicated those points. Among the controls, males scored slightly but significantly higher than females. The reliability of the AQ in both test-retest and inter-rater measures were significantly high.
15723027		The childhood-onset neuropsychiatric background to adulthood psychopathic traits and personality disorders.	Comprehensive psychiatry	2005	Henrik Soderstrom, Thomas Nilsson, Anna-Kari Sjodin, Anita Carlstedt, Anders Forsman		Childhood conduct disorder (CD) and adult psychopathic traits according to the Psychopathy Checklist Revised (PCL-R) were the closest psychiatric covariates to repeated violent crimes and aggression among offenders under forensic psychiatric investigation in Sweden. As psychopathy is not included in the present psychiatric diagnostic systems, we compared total and factor PCL-R scores to Axis I disorders, including childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorders, and to Axis II personality disorders, to establish the convergence of psychopathic traits with other psychiatric diagnoses, and to identify possible unique features. Psychopathic traits were positively correlated with bipolar mood disorder and negatively with unipolar depression. The total PCL-R scores as well as the Factor 2 (unemotionality) and Factor 3 (behavioral dyscontrol) scores were significantly correlated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Asperger's syndrome/high-functioning autistic traits, CD, substance abuse, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Cluster B personality disorders. The interpersonal Factor 1 showed none of these correlations and may capture features that are specific to psychopathy, distinguishing core psychopathy from other diagnostic definitions.

Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie	2005	Kathrin Hippler, Christian Klicpera		"In 1944 the Viennese paediatrician Hans Asperger described for the first time a number of boys with so-called ""autistic psychopathy"" but failed to give a detailed quantitative-descriptive phenomenology of the condition. The aim of this second part of a retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of children diagnosed by Asperger and his team is to provide a quantitative, in-depth description of these children, as well as to investigate Asperger's idea of a transition from autistic psychopathic personality traits towards ""normality"". We examined 181 case records of children seen between 1950 and 1986 who were either clearly diagnosed with autistic psychopathy (AP) or showed autistic features (AZ). Consequently, features common to both the AP and AZ groups and the differences between them are described and compared to the current ICD-10 criteria for Asperger's syndrome. Children with AZ shared the high intelligence, the social handicap and the impairment of ""instincts"", but showed less severe symptoms and more distinct skills, as well as fewer co-morbid disorders than children with AP. Results suggest that there is indeed something like an ""autistic phenotype"" with certain deficits and assets that can be found in less handicapped children with autistic impairments. The current ICD-10 criteria do not seem to fully capture Asperger's original account of the syndrome and should be discussed anew if Asperger's syndrome is reconsidered for inclusion into diagnostic criteria in the future."

The purpose of this study is to present a screening instrument (MBAS), which is sensitive to these disorders.
15707232		Behavioural treatment to reduce sleep problems in children with autism or fragile X syndrome.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2005	Sophie Weiskop, Amanda Richdale, Jan Matthews		There are few well-controlled, published evaluations of sleep interventions for children with developmental disabilities. This paper evaluates a parent training programme using behavioural principles to reduce sleep problems in children with autism or fragile X syndrome (FXS). Training included bedtime routines, reinforcement, effective instructions, partner support, and extinction (removing reinforcement to reduce a behaviour). Programme efficacy was demonstrated by using a multiple baseline across-participant design. Social validity was also assessed. Five children with autism and one with Asperger syndrome (four males, two females; mean age 5y 6mo; age range 3y 5mo to 7y 4mo) and their parents; and seven children with FXS (six males, one female; mean age 4y 9mo; age range ly 11mo to 9y 1mo) and their parents participated. Ten families completed intervention within the multiple baseline design. Most parents' goals were achieved and visual analysis of the sleep data indicated improvement. Settling problems, night waking, and co-sleeping were effectively reduced. The programme had high social validity and outcomes were clinically significant and maintained at follow-up.
15705609		Atypical sleep architecture and the autism phenotype.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2005	Elyse Limoges, Laurent Mottron, Christianne Bolduc, Claude Berthiaume, Roger Godbout		A growing body of evidence indicates that people with autism frequently experience sleep disorders and exhibit atypical sleep architecture. In order to establish whether sleep disorders truly belong to the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype, we conducted a subjective and objective study of sleep in a group of high-functioning adults with ASD but without sleep complaints, psychiatric disorders or neurological comorbidity. We compared the subjective data of 27 ASD participants with those of 78 healthy controls matched for chronological age and gender. Subjective measures of sleep in the clinical group were compatible with insomnia and/or a tolerable phase advance of the sleep-wake cycle. Subjective data were confirmed by objective laboratory sleep recordings in a subset of 16 patients and 16 controls. Persons with autism presented with a longer sleep latency (P < 0.04), more frequent nocturnal awakenings (P < 0.03), lower sleep efficiency (P < 0.03), increased duration of stage 1 sleep (P < 0.02), decreased non-REM sleep (stages 2 + 3 + 4, P < 0.04) and slow-wave sleep (stages 3 + 4, P < 0.05), fewer stage 2 EEG sleep spindles (P < 0.004), and a lower number of rapid eye movements during REM sleep (P < 0.006) than did control participants. On clinical scales, the scores of persons with ASD on the Beck Depression Inventory were similar to those of persons without, but their trait anxiety scores on the Spielberger Anxiety Scale were higher (P < 0.02). The state anxiety scores of the Spielberger scale and cortisol levels were the same in the two groups. Objective total sleep time correlated negatively with the Social (-0.52, P < 0.05) and Communication (-0.54, P < 0.02) scales of the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The sleep of clinical subgroups (10 with high-functioning autism, six with Asperger syndrome) did not differ, except for the presence of fewer EEG sleep spindles in the Asperger syndrome subgroup (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these findings indicate that atypicalities of sleep constitute a salient feature of the adult ASD phenotype and this should be further investigated in younger patients. Moreover, the results are consistent with an atypical organization of neural networks subserving the macro- and microstructure of sleep in ASD. We are furthering this research with quantified analysis of sleep EEG.

Assessment	2005	Sally Ozonoff, Nicanor Garcia, Elaine Clark, Janet E Lainhart		The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Second Edition was administered to 20 adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) who fell in the average to above average range of intelligence and 24 age-, intelligence-, and gender-matched college students. Large group differences, with the ASD group scoring higher, were found on the L validity scale, Clinical Scales 2 (D) and 0 (Si), Content scale Social Discomfort (SOD), Supplementary scale Repression (R), and Personality Psychopathology Five (PSY-5) scale INTR (Introversion). The proportion of ASD adults scoring in the clinical range on these scales was between 25% and 35%. High scores on these scales are consistent with the clinical picture of Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism in adulthood. Future directions and implications for identifying adults in need of a specialized autism assessment are discussed.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Marjorie Solomon, Beth L Goodlin-Jones, Thomas F Anders		This paper reports the findings of a 20-week social adjustment enhancement curriculum for boys aged 8-12. The curriculum was designed to address three areas hypothesized to be deficient in persons with HFA, AS, and PDDNOS: emotion recognition and understanding; theory of mind; and executive functions/real life type problem solving. Parents attended a semi-structured concurrent psychoeducational training meeting during children's sessions. Statistically significant improvements in facial expression recognition, and problem solving were reported for intervention group children compared to waiting list control group children. For the intervention group (the only group for whom data were available), older and less cognitively able boy's scores on a depression inventory decreased significantly more than younger children's. Mother's depression scores tended to decrease and there were significant reductions in child problem behaviors reported. Results are discussed in the context of individual differences in participant cognitive levels and profiles, symptom severity, and affect-related variables.

Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2004	Antonio Y Hardan, Roger J Jou, Benjamin L Handen		An open-label retrospective study was conducted to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of topiramate in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Topiramate is a novel antiepileptic drug approved as an adjunctive treatment for seizure disorders. A retrospective chart review was conducted in an outpatient clinic specialized in treating individuals with developmental disabilities, to identify all children and adolescents with PDD who received topiramate. Patients were included if concomitant medications remained unchanged. Treatment response was assessed using the Global Improvement item of the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI-GI), based on a review of medical records and the Conners Parent Scale (CPS), as completed by parents. Fifteen patients were identified (12 male, 3 female; age = 14.7 +/- 3.3 years), including 11 patients with autistic disorder, 2 patients with Asperger's disorder, and 2 patients with PDD not otherwise specified (PDD, NOS). Eight patients (4 patients with autistic disorder, 2 patients with Asperger's disorder, and 2 patients with PDD, NOS) were judged to be responders, as defined by a score of 1 or 2 on the CGI-GI. Treatment duration was 25 +/- 16 weeks, and the mean dose was 235 +/- 88 mg. Differences between baseline and the end-of-trial period were observed in the following CPS subscales: conduct, hyperactivity, and inattention. No differences were noted in the psychosomatic, learning, and anxiety subscales. Three patients discontinued topiramate because of side effects, with 2 patients experiencing cognitive difficulties and 1 patient a skin rash. Topiramate may be beneficial for treating secondary symptoms of PDD, and prospective openlabel studies and double-blind, placebo-controlled studies to assess its efficacy and safety are needed.

15628607		Source memory in adolescents and adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Dermot M Bowler, John M Gardiner, Natasha Berthollier		Memory difficulties in autism are observed mainly on measures like free recall, where test procedures provide no support for memory. When support is present, such as in cued recall, difficulties are less evident. Such observations may explain the mixed findings on source memory in autism. Bennetto, Pennington and Rogers (Child Development, 67, 1816-1835) found increased earlier-list intrusions in a multi-list free-recall paradigm (support absent), yet Farrant, Blades and Boucher (Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders, 28, 43-50) reported no impairment in identification of who had spoken a particular word at study (support present). We tested the effects on source memory of presence or absence of support for source in participants with Asperger's syndrome. The Asperger participants' overall deficit in source memory was largely eliminated when source was supported at test.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Viktoria Lyons, Michael Fitzgerald		Research has shown that individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome are impaired in humor appreciation, although anecdotal and parental reports provide some evidence to the contrary. This paper reviews the cognitive and affective processes involved in humor and recent neurological findings. It examines humor expression and understanding in autism and Asperger syndrome in the context of the main psychological theories (Theory of Mind, Executive Functions, Weak Central Coherence and Laterization models) and associated neural substrates. In the concluding sections, examples of humor displayed by individuals with autism/Asperger syndrome which appear to challenge the above theories are analyzed and areas for further research are suggested.

15618264		Sleep disturbances in adolescents and young adults with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2005	Nicolas M F Oyane, Bjørn Bjorvatn		Sleep problems are commonly reported in children with autistic disorders. Most studies are based on sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, but polysomnographic and actigraphic data have also been used. In this study we investigated sleep in older individuals (aged 15-25 years) with autism and Asperger syndrome, using sleep questionnaires, sleep diaries and actigraphy. Although the sleep questionnaires completed by parents and caretakers revealed only a moderate degree of sleep problems, greater sleep disturbance was recorded with actigraphy. Using the latter method, low sleep efficiency (below 85 percent) or long sleep latency (more than 30 minutes) were found in 80 percent of the individuals. There was no early morning awakening, contrary to some earlier reports. This study suggests that even though subjective complaints of sleep disturbances are less common in adolescents and young adults with autism, this may be due to an adaptation process rather than an actual reduction in sleep disturbances.
15618262		The CAST (Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test): test accuracy.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2005	Jo Williams, Fiona Scott, Carol Stott, Carrie Allison, Patrick Bolton, Simon Baron-Cohen, Carol Brayne		The Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test (CAST) is a parental questionnaire to screen for autism spectrum conditions. In this validation study, the CAST was distributed to 1925 children aged 5-11 in mainstream Cambridgeshire schools. A sample of participants received a full diagnostic assessment, conducted blind to screen status. The sensitivity of the CAST, at a designated cut-point of 15, was 100 percent, the specificity was 97 percent and the positive predictive value was 50 percent, using the group's consensus diagnosis as the gold standard. The accuracy indices varied with the case definition used. The sensitivity of the accuracy statistics to case definition and to missing data was explored. The CAST is useful as a screening test for autism spectrum conditions in epidemiological research. There is not currently enough evidence to recommend the use of the CAST as a screening test within a public health screening programme in the general population.

The survey was made in the urban setting of Gothenburg. During the period of observation, 6,386 patients were diagnosed. Among them 156 (2.4%) were diagnosed with a neuropsychiatric diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorders, disorders associated with Tourette's syndrome or mental retardation. The adult psychiatric hospital care does not recognize child neuropsychiatric disorders in the patient population by the frequency the disorders presumably appear. This is especially clear in the group of patients with a combination of narcotic substance abuse and psychiatric symptoms.

Developmental medicine and child neurology	2004	Hower Kwon, Andrew W Ow, Kate E Pedatella, Linda J Lotspeich, Allan L Reiss		Efforts to examine the structural neuroanatomy of autism by using traditional methods of imaging analysis have led to variable findings, often based on methodological differences in image acquisition and analysis. A voxel-based computational method of whole-brain anatomy allows examination of small patterns of tissue differences between groups. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance images were acquired for nine males with high-functioning autism (HFA; mean age 14y [SD3y 4mo]), 11 with Asperger syndrome (ASP; mean age 13y 6mo [SD2y 5mo]), and 13 comparison (COM) participants (mean age 13y 7mo [SD 3y 1mo]). Using statistical parametric mapping, we examined contrasts of gray matter differences between the groups. Males with HFA and ASP had a pattern of decreased gray matter density in the ventromedial regions of the temporal cortex in comparison with males from an age-matched comparison group. Examining contrasts revealed that the COM group had increased gray matter density compared with the ASP or combined HFA and ASP group in the right inferior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, and rostral fusiform gyrus. The ASP group had less gray matter density in the body of the cingulate gyrus in comparison with either the COM or HFA group. The findings of decreased gray matter density in ventromedial aspects of the temporal cortex in individuals with HFA and ASP lends support to theories suggesting an involvement of these areas in the pathophysiology of autism, particularly in the integration of visual stimuli and affective information.

It has been suggested that the sex difference in 2D:4D arises early in development and that finger ratio is a correlate of prenatal testosterone and oestrogen. In children, 2D:4D has been reported to be associated with measures of fetal growth, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, developmental psychopathology, autism and Asperger's syndrome. However, little is known of the patterns of sex and ethnic differences in the 2D:4D ratio of children.
15490278		The clinical necessity for assessing Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) symptoms in children with high-functioning Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD).	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2004	Yuko Yoshida, Tokio Uchiyama		Although the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) exclude Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), some clinicians find that the two disorders can be comorbid and, in fact, make a dual diagnosis. Nevertheless, few empirical studies have investigated the clinical necessity for this practice. In the first of our two studies, children with high-functioning PDD were selected from among 520 outpatients. Of these, children also meeting the DSM-IV criteria for AD/HD were identified through a psychologist's observation, the completion of the ADHD-Rating Scale by parents and/or teachers, and a child psychiatrist's examination. We then examined the impact of PDD subtype and age on the co-occurrence rate. Study 2 analyzed comorbidity in two cases taken from Study 1. Of the 53 subjects in Study 1, 36 children also met the DSM-IV criteria for AD/HD. The co-occurrence rate for Asperger's Disorder (AS)/Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Not Otherwise Specified (PDDNOS) (85%) was significantly higher than for Autistic Disorder (57.6 %), and AD/HD symptoms were more common in younger children. Study 2 demonstrated the existence of comorbidity of PDD and AD/HD as separate disorders. We conclude not only that AD/HD symptoms occur frequently in children with PDD, but also that in some cases a dual diagnosis is essential to the implementation of effective treatment.
15473168		One hundred males with Asperger syndrome: a clinical study of background and associated factors.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2004	Mats Cederlund, Christopher Gillberg		The objective of this study was to investigate the background and associated factors in a representative group of young males with Asperger syndrome (AS) presenting at a specialized autism clinic. One hundred males aged 5 years 6 months to 24 years 6 months, with a mean age of 11 years 4 months (SD 3y 10mo), who had a clinical diagnosis of AS were included in the study. An in-depth review of their medical records and neuropsychological test data was performed. There was a high rate (51%) of non-verbal learning disability (defined as Verbal IQ more than 15 points higher than Performance IQ), but otherwise there was little or no support for the notion of right-hemisphere brain dysfunction being at the core of the syndrome. There was a very high rate of close relatives with autism spectrum problems, but also high rates of prenatal and perinatal problems, including prematurity and postmaturity. In comparison with general population data, those with AS very often had a combination of genetic and prenatal and perinatal risk factors. Non-verbal learning disability test results applied in about half the group. There was a subgroup of individuals with AS who had macrocephalus. However, there was no support for an association of AS with low body mass index.
15450915		Lower limb motor restlessness in Asperger's disorder, measured using actometry.	Psychiatry research	2004	Katinka Tuisku, Pekka Tani, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Matti Mikael Holi, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen, Hannu Lauerma, Nina Lindberg, Björn Appelberg, Kristian Wahlbeck		The movement disturbances and brain imaging findings in Asperger's disorder (AD) suggest a dopaminergic deficit in movement regulation. Movement disorders of different etiologies have been quantified and specified with actometry. We compared 10 AD patients with 10 healthy controls, measuring their rest-activities by actometry. The lower limb motor activity was significantly higher in the AD group. They also displayed a rhythmic, periodic movement pattern similar to akathisia. These findings suggest a hypothesis of idiopathic akathisia and a special sensitivity to adverse effects of neuroleptic drugs.
15449514		Psychiatric symptoms in preschool children with PDD and clinic and comparison samples.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Kenneth D Gadow, Carla J DeVincent, John Pomeroy, Allen Azizian		This study describes and compares the severity of DSM-IV symptoms in preschool children with diagnosed pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), clinic controls, and two community-based samples.
15378722		Comparison of laser-induced dissociation and high-energy collision-induced dissociation using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) for peptide and protein identification.	Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM	2004	Marcus Macht, Arndt Asperger, Sören-Oliver Deininger		The fragmentation of peptides under laser-induced dissociation (LID) as well as high-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) conditions has been investigated. The effect of the different fragmentation mechanisms on the formation of specific fragment ion types and the usability of the resulting spectra, e.g. for high-throughput protein identification, has been evaluated. Also, basic investigations on the influence of the matrix, as well as laser fluence, on the fragment ion formation and the consequences in the spectral appearance are discussed. The preconditions for obtaining 'pure' CID spectra on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) instruments are evaluated and discussed as well as the differences between LID and CID in the resulting fragment ion types. While containing a wealth of information due to additional fragment ions in comparison with LID, CID spectra are significantly more complex than LID spectra and, due to different fragmentation patterns, the CID spectra are of limited use for protein identification, even under optimized parameter settings, due to significantly lower scores for the individual spectra. Conditions for optimal results regarding protein identification using MALDI-TOF/TOF instruments have been evaluated. For database searches using tandem mass spectrometric data, the use of LID as fragmentation technique in combination with parameter settings supporting the use of internal fragment ions turned out to yield the optimal results.
15378689		Molecular classification of liver cirrhosis in a rat model by proteomics and bioinformatics.	Proteomics	2004	Xiu-Qin Xu, Chon K Leow, Xin Lu, Xuegong Zhang, Jun S Liu, Wing-Hung Wong, Arndt Asperger, Sören Deininger, Hon-Chiu Eastwood Leung		Liver cirrhosis is a worldwide health problem. Reliable, noninvasive methods for early detection of liver cirrhosis are not available. Using a three-step approach, we classified sera from rats with liver cirrhosis following different treatment insults. The approach consisted of: (i) protein profiling using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) technology; (ii) selection of a statistically significant serum biomarker set using machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identification of selected serum biomarkers by peptide sequencing. We generated serum protein profiles from three groups of rats: (i) normal (n=8), (ii) thioacetamide-induced liver cirrhosis (n=22), and (iii) bile duct ligation-induced liver fibrosis (n=5) using a weak cation exchanger surface. Profiling data were further analyzed by a recursive support vector machine algorithm to select a panel of statistically significant biomarkers for class prediction. Sensitivity and specificity of classification using the selected protein marker set were higher than 92%. A consistently down-regulated 3495 Da protein in cirrhosis samples was one of the selected significant biomarkers. This 3495 Da protein was purified on-chip and trypsin digested. Further structural characterization of this biomarkers candidate was done by using cross-platform matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight/time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Combined data from PMF and MS/MS spectra of two tryptic peptides suggested that this 3495 Da protein shared homology to a histidine-rich glycoprotein. These results demonstrated a novel approach to discovery of new biomarkers for early detection of liver cirrhosis and classification of liver diseases.
15376613		[Diagnosis and etiology of Asperger syndrome in children and adolescents].	Praxis der Kinderpsychologie und Kinderpsychiatrie	2004	Inge Kamp-Becker, Fritz Mattejat, Helmut Remschmidt		The Asperger-Syndrom is a pervasive developmental disorder, characterized by impairments in primarily social and communicative competence, empathy, associated with motor awkwardness and/or clumsiness and highly circumscribed interests. The diagnostic criteria and the diagnostic methods are in detail exemplified. While the validity of autism (Kanner-syndrom) has been shown through multiple different levels of evidence, the validity of Asperger-Syndrom is still unestablished. The few literature is extremely difficult to summarize (Volkmar u. Klin 2000), given that a range of important methodological issues render comparability of findings across studies virtually impossible: these include differences in definition and circularity in definition relative to validating measures. In terms of causes of Asperger-Syndrom the following factors are discussed: genetic reasons, neurobiological disturbances and neuropsychological deficits.
15365889		The history of autism.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2004	Sula Wolff		Autism remains a fascinating condition, perhaps the most prolifically researched of all child psychiatric disorders. Its history yields many lessons: early accounts of possible autism are, with one exception, unclear; the greatest contributions to our understanding have come from individual clinicians and researchers; the concept and definition of the disorder have changed greatly over the years; some ideas once held with conviction, were later proved to be unfounded; and socio-political shifts as well as research findings have radically altered our understanding of the syndrome as well as the care and treatment offered to people with autism.

Lancet (London, England)		Liam Smeeth, Claire Cook, Eric Fombonne, Lisa Heavey, Laura C Rodrigues, Peter G Smith, Andrew J Hall		Concern that measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination might cause autism has led to a fall in vaccine coverage. We investigated whether MMR vaccination is associated with an increased risk of autism or other pervasive developmental disorders.
15358872		Parent management training and Asperger syndrome: a randomized controlled trial to evaluate a parent based intervention.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2004	Kate Sofronoff, Anthony Leslie, Wendy Brown		This controlled trial of a parent management intervention aimed to increase parental competence in management of problem behaviours associated with Asperger syndrome. The intervention compared two formats, a 1 day workshop and six individual sessions. Measures were taken on three occasions: pre-intervention, at 4 weeks, and at 3 month follow-up. Variables of interest were number and intensity of problem behaviours, and parent evaluation of social interaction skills. Results showed parents reporting fewer and lower intensity of problem behaviours and increased social interactions at 4 weeks and 3 months. Results held across formats and suggest that parent management training can provide an effective intervention for parents of a child with Asperger syndrome. Group differences on outcome measures and in the use of strategies are discussed along with limitations of the study.
15358869		Advanced mind-reading in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2004	Koen S Ponnet, Herbert Roeyers, Ann Buysse, Armand De Clercq, Eva Van der Heyden		This study investigated the mind-reading abilities of 19 adults with Asperger syndrome and 19 typically developing adults. Two static mind-reading tests and a more naturalistic empathic accuracy task were used. In the empathic accuracy task, participants attempted to infer the thoughts and feelings of target persons, while viewing a videotape of the target persons in a naturally occurring conversation with another person. The results are consistent with earlier findings. The empathic accuracy task indicated significant between-group differences, whereas no such differences were found on the static mind-reading tasks. The most innovative finding of the present study is that the inference ability of adults with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and controls depends on the focus of the target's thoughts and feelings, and that the empathic accuracy of adults with Asperger syndrome and control adults might be different in terms of quantity and quality.
15351077		'Nurturing the brain' as an emerging research field involving child neurology.	Brain & development	2004	Masao Ito	Brain Science Institute, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. masao@brain.riken.jp	'Nurturing the brain' is an emerging research field integrating brain science, child care and education, which also involves child neurology. It has emerged from the recent remarkable progress in brain science and strong social demands for improvements in child care and education. This article reviews the current status of three major research themes in this field. First, developmental disorders represented by attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism and Asperger syndrome often introduce difficulties in child care and education, which are to be addressed by appropriate assessment and treatment of affected children based on new knowledge of the pathogenesis of these disorders. Second, recent progress in research on the critical/sensitive periods of development of brain structures and functions promises useful advice for teachers and parents regarding optimal timing and ways of teaching various subjects. Third, the development of the brain throughout infancy, childhood and adolescence is paralleled by the growth and maturation of the mind. Neuronal mechanisms underlying the theory of mind, mirror neurons, internal model, cognitive control, and cognitive emotion regulation are important themes that bridge our understandings of the brain and the mind.

15301788		Essential fatty acids and phospholipase A2 in autistic spectrum disorders.	Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids	2004	J G Bell, E E MacKinlay, J R Dick, D J MacDonald, R M Boyle, A C A Glen		A health questionnaire based on parental observations of clinical signs of fatty acid deficiency (FAD) showed that patients with autism and Asperger's syndrome (ASP) had significantly higher FAD scores (6.34+/-4.37 and 7.64+/-6.20, respectively) compared to controls (1.78+/-1.68). Patients with regressive autism had significantly higher percentages of 18:0,18:2n-6 and total saturates in their RBC membranes compared to controls, while 24:0, 22:5n-6, 24:1 and the 20:4n-6/20:5n-3 ratio were significantly higher in both regressive autism and ASP groups compared to controls. By comparison, the 18:1n-9 and 20:4n-6 values were significantly lower in patients with regressive autism compared to controls while 22:5n-3, total n-3 and total dimethyl acetals were significantly lower in both regressive autism and ASP groups compared to controls. Storage of RBC at -20 degrees C for 6 weeks resulted in significant reductions in highly unsaturated fatty acid levels in polar lipids of patients with regressive autism, compared to patients with classical autism or ASP, or controls. Patients diagnosed with both autism and ASP showed significantly increased levels of EPA ( approximately 200%) and DHA ( approximately 40%), and significantly reduced levels of ARA ( approximately 20%), 20:3n-6 and ARA/EPA ratio in their RBC polar lipids, when supplemented with EPA-rich fish oils, compared to controls and non-supplemented patients with autism. Patients with both regressive autism and classical autism/Asperger's syndrome had significantly higher concentrations of RBC type IV phospholipase A2 compared to controls. However, patients with autism/ASP, who had taken EPA supplements, had significantly reduced PLA2 concentrations compared to unsupplemented patients with classical autism or ASP.
15292669		Sleep in young adults with Asperger syndrome.	Neuropsychobiology	2004	Pekka Tani, Nina Lindberg, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Jussi Virkkala, Björn Appelberg, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder belonging to autism spectrum disorders. Both children and adults with AS have subjective impairment in the initiation and continuity of sleep, and studies using objective assessment are sparse. Twenty young AS adults with frequent complaints of low sleep quality were compared to 10 age-, gender- and education-matched controls without sleep complaints using polysomnography and spectral power analysis of slow-wave sleep. AS subjects displayed a similar polysomnographic profile as compared with controls. In spectral power analysis, a statistically nonsignificant trend towards decreased relative delta power and increased theta power in slow-wave sleep was found in the AS group. It seems that nonorganic insomnia, due to anxiety inherent in AS, is responsible for the low sleep quality in these subjects.
15284643		Autism: developing a strategy for nursing to prevent discrimination.	British journal of nursing (Mark Allen Publishing)		Jill Aylott	Centre for Professional and Organization Development, School of Health and Social Care, Sheffield Hallam University.	The final phase of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) comes into force in October 2004. The DDA Code of Practice is a document to guide organizations in the implementation of and compliance with the Act. The DDA Code of Practice (2002) makes reference to specific impairments, such as hearing and visual impairments, and there are numerous examples of how 'reasonable adjustments' can be made to enable access to those so disabled. There is recognition that some impairments are hidden, e.g. learning disabilities and diabetes. However, no mention is made of those with autism. The impairments of autism including Asperger syndrome are also 'hidden impairments' as defined by the DDA and this will mean that it will not be immediately obvious as to how the Act will help nurses to amend their practice to enable people with autism full inclusion and access to health care. This article will explore practical implications and outline how nurses can develop their practice to be compliant with the Act and to ensure good 'health care' practice for people diagnosed within the autism spectrum.
15282371		Eshkol-Wachman movement notation in diagnosis: the early detection of Asperger's syndrome.	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America	2004	Osnat Teitelbaum, Tom Benton, Prithvi K Shah, Andrea Prince, Joseph L Kelly, Philip Teitelbaum		"The diagnostic criteria of Asperger's syndrome (AS), considered a part of the autistic spectrum disorder, are still unclear. A critical marker, which distinguishes AS from autism, is the presence of language. The ability of a child with AS to acquire and use language early results in the fact that AS usually is diagnosed much later than autism. Autism is not usually diagnosed until around the age of 3, whereas AS usually is not diagnosed until the child is 6 or 7 years of age. In the present article, using Eshkol-Wachman movement notation, we present evidence that abnormal movement patterns can be detected in AS in infancy. This finding suggests that AS can be diagnosed very early, independent of the presence of language. As shown earlier by us, almost all of the movement disturbances in autism can be interpreted as infantile reflexes ""gone astray""; i.e., some reflexes are not inhibited at the appropriate age in development, whereas others fail to appear when they should. This phenomenon appears to apply to AS as well. Based on preliminary results, a simple test using one such reflex is proposed for the early detection of a subgroup of children with AS or autism."

15264499		An exploration of causes of non-literal language problems in individuals with Asperger Syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Ingerith Martin, Skye McDonald		Individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS), a high functioning variant of Autism, are often noted to possess intact language ability, yet fail to use this language capacity to engage in interactive communication. This difficulty using language in a social context has been referred to as a deficit in pragmatic language. In particular, difficulty understanding nonliteral language devices, such as irony has been observed. This paper examines the veracity of two theories that have attempted to explain the causes of pragmatic language difficulties in individuals with Asperger Syndrome; the theory of Weak Central Coherence (WCC) and Social Inference theory. Fourteen young adults with AS and 24 age-matched controls were assessed on cognitive tasks measuring WCC processes, social inference or Theory of Mind ability, and the ability to interpret ironic remarks. Results indicated that the ability to understand the belief states of others is critical to understanding ironic language in AS.
15264498		Empathising and systemising in adults with and without Asperger Syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	John Lawson, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright		An experiment was devised to test the empathising-systemising (E-S) theory of autism. Three groups of participants took part in the study: males with Asperger Syndrome (AS) (n = 18), males without AS, (n = 44) and females from the general population (n = 45). Each participant completed two tasks: one that involved empathising and another that involved systemising. On the empathising task, females scored significantly higher than control males who in turn scored higher than males with AS. Conversely, females scored significantly lower than both male groups on the systemising task, who did not differ significantly from each other. These results are in line with both the E-S theory of autism and the 'extreme male brain' theory of autism. Alternative explanations of the results are also explored, including an interpretation through the idea of open and closed systems.
15264496		Defining the intellectual profile of Asperger Syndrome: comparison with high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Mohammad Ghaziuddin, Kimberly Mountain-Kimchi		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a disorder of early childhood characterized by autistic social deficits, subtle communication impairment, and excessive isolated interests. There is no history of language delay or of mental retardation. Despite its increasing popularity as a distinct condition, its diagnostic validity remains uncertain. It is still unclear to what extent AS differs from autism with normal intelligence sometimes referred to as high-functioning autism (HFA). However, some reports have suggested that persons with AS possess a distinct profile on tests of intelligence characterized by a high verbal IQ and a low performance IQ, whereas in most cases with HFA, the pattern is reversed. Since few studies have directly compared AS subjects with HFA controls using unmodified diagnostic criteria and standardized measures of assessment, in this report we compared 22 AS subjects with 12 HFA controls, matched on age, sex and level of intelligence. As a group, subjects with AS showed a higher verbal IQ and higher scores on information and vocabulary subtests than those with HFA. However, scores of several AS and HFA subjects showed a mixed pattern. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the validity of Asperger Syndrome.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2004	José I Alcántara, Emma J L Weisblatt, Brian C J Moore, Patrick F Bolton		High-functioning individuals with autism (HFA) or Asperger's syndrome (AS) commonly report difficulties understanding speech in situations where there is background speech or noise. The objective of this study was threefold: (1) to verify the validity of these reports; (2) to quantify the difficulties experienced; and (3) to propose possible mechanisms to explain the perceptual deficits described.

15254095		The amygdala is enlarged in children but not adolescents with autism; the hippocampus is enlarged at all ages.	The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience	2004	Cynthia Mills Schumann, Julia Hamstra, Beth L Goodlin-Jones, Linda J Lotspeich, Hower Kwon, Michael H Buonocore, Cathy R Lammers, Allan L Reiss, David G Amaral		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in reciprocal social interaction, deficits in verbal and nonverbal communication, and a restricted repertoire of activities or interests. We performed a magnetic resonance imaging study to better define the neuropathology of autistic spectrum disorders. Here we report findings on the amygdala and the hippocampal formation. Borders of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebrum were defined, and their volumes were measured in male children (7.5-18.5 years of age) in four diagnostic groups: autism with mental retardation, autism without mental retardation, Asperger syndrome, and age-matched typically developing controls. Although there were no differences between groups in terms of total cerebral volume, children with autism (7.5-12.5 years of age) had larger right and left amygdala volumes than control children. There were no differences in amygdala volume between the adolescent groups (12.75-18.5 years of age). Interestingly, the amygdala in typically developing children increases substantially in volume from 7.5 to 18.5 years of age. Thus, the amygdala in children with autism is initially larger, but does not undergo the age-related increase observed in typically developing children. Children with autism, with and without mental retardation, also had a larger right hippocampal volume than typically developing controls, even after controlling for total cerebral volume. Children with autism but without mental retardation also had a larger left hippocampal volume relative to controls. These cross-sectional findings indicate an abnormal program of early amygdala development in autism and an abnormal pattern of hippocampal development that persists through adolescence. The cause of amygdala and hippocampal abnormalities in autism is currently unknown.
15230456		Autism spectrum disorders in children with normal intellectual levels: associated impairments and subgroups.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2004	Harald Sturm, Elisabeth Fernell, Christopher Gillberg		In order to define potential subgroups pertaining to the spectrum of 'high-functioning' pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) the medical and psychiatric records of 101 children with PDD were reviewed. Ninety-one children had a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, nine had a PDD not otherwise specified, and one had 'high-functioning' autism. Mean age of the children (71 males, 30 females) was 9 years 8 months (age range 5 to 12 years). Apart from the core dysfunctions of the PDD, i.e. deficient social interaction, communication and repertoires, and restricted interests, 95% had attentional problems, 75% had motor difficulties, 86% had problems with regulation of activity level, and 50% had impulsiveness. About three-quarters had symptoms compatible with mild or severe attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or had deficits in attention, motor control, and perception (DAMP), indicating a considerable overlap between these disorders and high-functioning PDD in children of normal or near-normal intelligence. A combination of affective dysregulation, thought disturbance, and severely restricted social interaction, referred to as a multiple complex developmental disorder (MCDD; a condition possibly related to schizoaffective disorder), was recorded in about 8% of the children. Seventeen percent had another major medical diagnosis or medical syndrome, which highlights the importance of completing a neurological assessment of all children with PDDs.
15215211		Are patients with social developmental disorders prosopagnosic? Perceptual heterogeneity in the Asperger and socio-emotional processing disorders.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2004	Jason J S Barton, Mariya V Cherkasova, Rebecca Hefter, Terry A Cox, Margaret O'Connor, Dara S Manoach		It has been hypothesized that social developmental disorders (SDD) like autism, Asperger's disorder and the social-emotional processing disorder may be associated with prosopagnosic-like deficits in face recognition. We studied the ability to recognize famous faces in 24 adults with a variety of SDD diagnoses. We also measured their ability to discriminate changes in internal facial configuration, a perceptual function that is important in face recognition, and their imagery for famous faces, an index of their facial memory stores. We contrasted their performance with both healthy subjects and prosopagnosic patients. We also performed a cluster analysis of the SDD patients. One group of eight SDD subjects performed normally on all tests of face perception and recognition. The other 16 subjects were impaired in recognition, though most were better than prosopagnosic patients. One impaired SDD subgroup had poor perception of facial structure but relatively preserved imagery, resembling prosopagnosic patients with medial occipitotemporal lesions. Another subgroup had better perception than imagery, resembling one prosopagnosic with bilateral anterior temporal lesions. Overall, SDD subgroup membership by face recognition did not correlate with a particular SDD diagnosis or subjective ratings of social impairment. We conclude that the social disturbance in SDD does not invariably lead to impaired face recognition. Abnormal face recognition in some SDD subjects is related to impaired perception of facial structure in a manner suggestive of occipitotemporal dysfunction. Heterogeneity in the perceptual processing of faces may imply pathogenetic heterogeneity, with important implications for genetic and rehabilitative studies of SDD.
15212111		The functional neuroanatomy of autism.	Functional neurology	2004	Paolo Brambilla, Antonio Y Hardan, Stefania Ucelli di Nemi, Edgardo Caverzasi, Jair C Soares, Jorge Perez, Francesco Barale		Autism is a neurodevelopmental syndrome characterized by impaired social and executive functions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive technique that allows investigation of the neural networks underlying cognitive impairments in autism. In this article, brain imaging studies investigating the functional brain anatomy of autism are reviewed. Face recognition, theory of mind and executive functions have all been explored in functional neuroimaging studies involving autistic patients. The available literature suggests an involvement of abnormal functional mechanisms in face recognition, mentalization and executive functions in adults with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome, possibly due to brain maturation abnormalities, and resulting in dysfunctional reciprocal cortico-subcortical connections. Future functional neuroimaging research should investigate subgroups of autistic children and adolescents longitudinally and attempt to integrate genetic, cognitive and empirical approaches. Such studies will be instrumental in furthering understanding of the pathophysiology of autism and in exploring the importance of dimensional measures of the broader phenotype currently defined as autism.
15198632		Nonverbal learning disability: a tutorial for speech-language pathologists.	American journal of speech-language pathology	2004	Joanne Volden	University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. joanne.volden@ualberta.ca	Nonverbal learning disability (NLD) is a diagnostic category that is unfamiliar to most speech-language pathologists. This brief tutorial describes NLD's characteristics, a theoretical model proposed to explain its source, and areas of overlap between NLD and similar diagnostic categories. The communicative profile, made up of difficulties in pragmatic and semantic language in the presence of relatively preserved syntactic skill, is also discussed. Empirical evidence relevant to NLD is also evaluated. Many questions remain unresolved, but until systematic research provides definitive answers, speech-language pathologists are encouraged to rely on careful description of the individual child's communicative strengths and weaknesses to identify appropriate targets and to focus intervention on improving the child's ability to communicate effectively in everyday contexts.

Language, speech, and hearing services in schools	2004	Alan G Kamhi	Department of Communicative Disorders, Northern Illinois University, DeKalb 60115, USA. akamhi@niu.edu	"In this article, the reason why certain terms, labels, and ideas prevail, whereas others fail to gain acceptance, will be considered. Borrowing the concept of ""meme"" from the study of evolution of ideas, it will be clear why language-based and phonological disorders have less widespread appeal than, for example, auditory processing and sensory integration disorders. Discussion will also center on why most speech-language pathologists refer to themselves as speech therapists or speech pathologists, and why it is more desirable to have dyslexia than to have a reading disability. In a meme's eye view, science and logic do not always win out because selection favors ideas (memes) that are easy to understand, remember, and copy. An unfortunate consequence of these selection forces is that successful memes typically provide superficially plausible answers for complex questions."

Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde	2004	I A van Berckelaer-Onnes	Universiteit Leiden, faculteit der Sociale Wetenschappen, Ambulatorium, Postbus 9555, 2300 RB Leiden. berck@fsw.leidenuniv.nl	The concept of autism has been broadened the last few years from 'early infantile autism' to 'an autistic spectrum'. Autism and related contact disorders are grouped together under 'pervasive developmental disorders' or 'autistic spectrum disorders'. The autistic disorder, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett's disorder and the childhood disintegrative disorder all belong to this group. People with an autistic spectrum disorder have severe difficulties in the integration of perceived stimuli into a meaningful entity. More than two-thirds of the people with the autistic disorder (classical autism) are also mentally retarded. Although autism can still only be diagnosed at the behavioural level, there is considerable consensus regarding an underlying organic aetiology. Autism is clearly a multifactorial condition. Autism cannot be cured, but adequate intervention can significantly improve the quality of life of people with this disorder. Diagnosis and intervention are highly interrelated. In the intervention, a distinction is made between family-oriented and child-oriented strategies. Augmentative communication plays a key role in the treatment. People with autism need a lot of structure, clarity and predictability, also when they have become adults.
15184241		Perinatal factors and the development of autism: a population study.	Archives of general psychiatry	2004	Emma J Glasson, Carol Bower, Beverly Petterson, Nick de Klerk, Gervase Chaney, Joachim F Hallmayer		Autism is considered to have a genetic basis, although exposure to certain stimuli in the prenatal period has been implicated to be causal in some cases. Some investigations have shown an association with obstetric complications but findings have been inconsistent owing to differences in sampling and methods.

15162938		Spatial frequency and face processing in children with autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Christine Deruelle, Cecilie Rondan, Bruno Gepner, Carole Tardif		Two experiments were designed to investigate possible abnormal face processing strategies in children with autistic spectrum disorders. A group of 11 children with autism was compared to two groups of normally developing children matched on verbal mental age and on chronological age. In the first experiment, participants had to recognize faces on the basis of identity, emotion, gaze direction, gender, and lip reading. All aspects of face processing, except for identity matching, were deficient in the autistic population compared with controls. In the second study, children had to match faces on either high-(i.e., local facial features) or low-spatial frequency information (i.e., global configuration of faces). Contrary to the control subjects, children with autism showed better performance when using high rather than low spatial frequency, confirming face-processing peculiarities in this population.
15162935		The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright		Empathy is an essential part of normal social functioning, yet there are precious few instruments for measuring individual differences in this domain. In this article we review psychological theories of empathy and its measurement. Previous instruments that purport to measure this have not always focused purely on empathy. We report a new self-report questionnaire, the Empathy Quotient (EQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 empathy items and 20 filler/control items. On each empathy item a person can score 2, 1, or 0, so the EQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1 we employed the EQ with n = 90 adults (65 males, 25 females) with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who are reported clinically to have difficulties in empathy. The adults with AS/HFA scored significantly lower on the EQ than n = 90 (65 males, 25 females) age-matched controls. Of the adults with AS/HFA, 81% scored equal to or fewer than 30 points out of 80, compared with only 12% of controls. In Study 2 we carried out a study of n = 197 adults from a general population, to test for previously reported sex differences (female superiority) in empathy. This confirmed that women scored significantly higher than men. The EQ reveals both a sex difference in empathy in the general population and an empathy deficit in AS/HFA.

15148861		Trends in autism.	International journal of adolescent medicine and health	2004	Joav Merrick, Isack Kandel, Mohammed Morad		Leo Kanner described autism in 1943, and Hans Asperger described the syndrome in 1944. The term Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) was first used in the 1980s to describe a class of disorders that include (1) Autistic disorder, (2) Rett disorder or syndrome, (3) Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, (4) Asperger's disorder or syndrome, and (5) Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, or PDDNOS. Autism prevalence studies published before 1985 showed prevalence rates of 4 to 5 per 10,000 children for the broader autism spectrum, and about 2 per 10,000 for the classic autism definition. Since 1985 there have been higher rates of autism reported from several countries. From the UK a prevalence rate of 16.8 per 10,000 children for autistic disorder was reported, and 62.6 per 10,000 for the entire autistic spectrum disorders. Sweden reported a prevalence of 36 per 10,000 for Asperger and 35 per 10,000 for social impairment, or a total prevalence of 71 per 10,000 for suspected and possible cases. From the US, 40 per 10,000 in three to ten year old children for autistic disorder and 67 per 10,000 children for the entire autism spectrum was reported. From the north region in Israel for children born between 1989-93 in the Haifa area, an incidence rate of 10 per 10,000 was found for autism. In recent years concern has been shown about the possible increase in the prevalence of autistic spectrum disorders. Studies have shown an increase, but during these last twenty years diagnostic criteria and definition have also changed. Although many factors are at play, it is evident that there has been an increase.
15145468		Persecutory beliefs, attributions and theory of mind: comparison of patients with paranoid delusions, Asperger's syndrome and healthy controls.	Schizophrenia research	2004	Jaime S Craig, Christopher Hatton, Fiona B Craig, Richard P Bentall		Schizophrenia patients with persecutory delusions and patients with Asperger's syndrome were compared using two measures of theory of mind (ToM; the ability to infer mental states in other people), the Hints task, and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes task, and a new measure of attributional style (style of inferring the causes of important events), the Attributional Style Structured Interview (ASSI). Paranoid beliefs were measured using Fenigstien and Vanable's Paranoia Scale (PS). The deluded group had the highest scores on the Paranoia Scale but the scores of the Asperger's group's were higher than those of the controls. Paranoid patients made more external-personal attributions for negative events than the Asperger's and control groups. Both the paranoid and Asperger's groups performed poorly on the ToM tasks compared to the controls. The findings support the hypothesis that both ToM and attributional abnormalities contribute to paranoid delusions. The lack of attributional abnormalities in the Asperger's group suggests that their low-level paranoid symptoms arise as a consequence of different mechanisms than those involved in psychotic delusions.

15134791		Finding meaning in parenting a child with Asperger syndrome: correlates of sense making and benefit finding.	Research in developmental disabilities	2004	Kenneth I Pakenham, Kate Sofronoff, Christina Samios		This study explored the nature of two construals of meaning, benefit finding and sense making, in parents of a child with Asperger syndrome, and examined relations between both meaning constructs and the Double ABCX family stress model variables (initial stressor and pile-up of demands, appraisal, social support, coping strategies and adjustment) [H.I. McCubbin, J.M. Patterson, Social Stress and the Family: Advances and Developments in Family Stress Theory and Research, Haworth, New York, 1983, pp. 7-37]. A total of 59 parents completed questionnaires. Content analyses of parents' responses to questions inquiring about gains and sense making explanations revealed 8 benefit and 12 sense making themes. Results of correlations indicated that one or more of the meaning variables were related to each of the Double ABCX model predictors of parental adjustment. The meaning variables were positively related to adaptive coping processes: social support, self-efficacy, and problem-focused and emotional approach coping strategies.
15132762		Increased repetitive behaviours and prolactin responsivity to oral m-chlorophenylpiperazine in adults with autism spectrum disorders.	The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology	2004	Sherie Novotny, Eric Hollander, Ann Phillips, Andrea Allen, Stacey Wasserman, Rupa Iyengar		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysfunction in three primary behavioural domains: repetitive behaviours, social deficits, and language abnormalities. There is evidence that abnormalities exist in the serotonin (5-HT) system in autism spectrum patients. Furthermore, 5-HT is known to play a role in repetitive and social behaviours. This study examined the effect of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) on repetitive behaviours and prolactin response in 11 adults with autism or Aspergers disorder and 8 age- and gender-matched healthy controls via randomized double-blind, m-CPP and placebo challenges. The primary outcome measure was an instrument rating six repetitive behaviours: need to know, repeating, ordering, need to tell/ask, self-injury, and touching. Patients with autism spectrum disorders showed a significant increase in repetitive behaviours at end-point following oral m-CPP in comparison to placebo. Additionally subjects with autism spectrum disorders showed a significantly increased prolactin response to m-CPP compared to normal controls, with neither group responding to placebo. This study provides further evidence for altered 5-HT sensitivity in individuals with autism spectrum disorders, as well as a possible relationship between repetitive behaviours in autism spectrum disorders and abnormalities in the 5-HT system.
15124148		Asperger's disorder: a review of its diagnosis and treatment.	Comprehensive psychiatry	2004	Hani Raoul Khouzam, Fayez El-Gabalawi, Nabeel Pirwani, Fiona Priest		Asperger's disorder is a pervasive developmental disorder that shares similar features of social impairment disorder, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors with autistic disorder. Although both Asperger's disorder and autistic disorder persist into adulthood, autistic disorder is usually apparent before the age of 3, while Asperger's disorder usually manifests itself at preschool age. Asperger's disorder in the majority of cases is not associated with delay in language development and there is an increased likelihood to seek social interactions and to engage in activities and friendship with others. In contrast to autistic disorder, most Asperger's disorder patients have normal intellectual functioning and some have motor clumsiness. Although the etiology of Asperger's disorder is still undetermined, this article will review the assessment and treatment interventions that could improve the prognosis of this illness. The historical background, epidemiology, diagnostic features, differential diagnosis, and course and overall management/treatment of Asperger's disorder will be discussed. Despite the absence of a cure for Asperger's disorder, the awareness of its distinctive clinical features that differentiate it from autistic disorder could improve its prognosis and differentiate response to treatment and comorbid conditions.
15121991		The genetics of autism.	Pediatrics	2004	Rebecca Muhle, Stephanie V Trentacoste, Isabelle Rapin		"Autism is a complex, behaviorally defined, static disorder of the immature brain that is of great concern to the practicing pediatrician because of an astonishing 556% reported increase in pediatric prevalence between 1991 and 1997, to a prevalence higher than that of spina bifida, cancer, or Down syndrome. This jump is probably attributable to heightened awareness and changing diagnostic criteria rather than to new environmental influences. Autism is not a disease but a syndrome with multiple nongenetic and genetic causes. By autism (the autistic spectrum disorders [ASDs]), we mean the wide spectrum of developmental disorders characterized by impairments in 3 behavioral domains: 1) social interaction; 2) language, communication, and imaginative play; and 3) range of interests and activities. Autism corresponds in this article to pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Except for Rett syndrome--attributable in most affected individuals to mutations of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) gene--the other PDD subtypes (autistic disorder, Asperger disorder, disintegrative disorder, and PDD Not Otherwise Specified [PDD-NOS]) are not linked to any particular genetic or nongenetic cause. Review of 2 major textbooks on autism and of papers published between 1961 and 2003 yields convincing evidence for multiple interacting genetic factors as the main causative determinants of autism. Epidemiologic studies indicate that environmental factors such as toxic exposures, teratogens, perinatal insults, and prenatal infections such as rubella and cytomegalovirus account for few cases. These studies fail to confirm that immunizations with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine are responsible for the surge in autism. Epilepsy, the medical condition most highly associated with autism, has equally complex genetic/nongenetic (but mostly unknown) causes. Autism is frequent in tuberous sclerosis complex and fragile X syndrome, but these 2 disorders account for but a small minority of cases. Currently, diagnosable medical conditions, cytogenetic abnormalities, and single-gene defects (eg, tuberous sclerosis complex, fragile X syndrome, and other rare diseases) together account for <10% of cases. There is convincing evidence that ""idiopathic"" autism is a heritable disorder. Epidemiologic studies report an ASD prevalence of approximately 3 to 6/1000, with a male to female ratio of 3:1. This skewed ratio remains unexplained: despite the contribution of a few well characterized X-linked disorders, male-to-male transmission in a number of families rules out X-linkage as the prevailing mode of inheritance. The recurrence rate in siblings of affected children is approximately 2% to 8%, much higher than the prevalence rate in the general population but much lower than in single-gene diseases. Twin studies reported 60% concordance for classic autism in monozygotic (MZ) twins versus 0 in dizygotic (DZ) twins, the higher MZ concordance attesting to genetic inheritance as the predominant causative agent. Reevaluation for a broader autistic phenotype that included communication and social disorders increased concordance remarkably from 60% to 92% in MZ twins and from 0% to 10% in DZ pairs. This suggests that interactions between multiple genes cause ""idiopathic"" autism but that epigenetic factors and exposure to environmental modifiers may contribute to variable expression of autism-related traits. The identity and number of genes involved remain unknown. The wide phenotypic variability of the ASDs likely reflects the interaction of multiple genes within an individual's genome and the existence of distinct genes and gene combinations among those affected. There are 3 main approaches to identifying genetic loci, chromosomal regions likely to contain relevant genes: 1) whole genome screens, searching for linkage of autism to shared genetic markers in populations of multiplex families (families with >1 affected family member; 2) cytogenetic studies that may guide molecular studies by pointing to relevant inherited or de novo chromosomal abnormalities in affected individuals and their families; and 3) evaluation of candidate genes known to affect brain development in these significantly linked regions or, alternatively, linkage of candidate genes selected a priori because of their presumptive contribution to the pathogenesis of autism. Data from whole-genome screens in multiplex families suggest interactions of at least 10 genes in the causation of autism. Thus far, a putative speech and language region at 7q31-q33 seems most strongly linked to autism, with linkages to multiple other loci under investigation. Cytogenetic abnormalities at the 15q11-q13 locus are fairly frequent in people with autism, and a ""chromosome 15 phenotype"" was described in individuals with chromosome 15 duplications. Among other candidate genes are the FOXP2, RAY1/ST7, IMMP2L, and RELN genes at 7q22-q33 and the GABA(A) receptor subunit and UBE3A genes on chromosome 15q11-q13. Variant alleles of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT) on 17q11-q12 are more frequent in individuals with autism than in nonautistic populations. In addition, animal models and linkage data from genome screens implicate the oxytocin receptor at 3p25-p26. Most pediatricians will have 1 or more children with this disorder in their practices. They must diagnose ASD expeditiously because early intervention increases its effectiveness. Children with dysmorphic features, congenital anomalies, mental retardation, or family members with developmental disorders are those most likely to benefit from extensive medical testing and genetic consultation. The yield of testing is much less in high-functioning children with a normal appearance and IQ and moderate social and language impairments. Genetic counseling justifies testing, but until autism genes are identified and their functions are understood, prenatal diagnosis will exist only for the rare cases ascribable to single-gene defects or overt chromosomal abnormalities. Parents who wish to have more children must be told of their increased statistical risk. It is crucial for pediatricians to try to involve families with multiple affected members in formal research projects, as family studies are key to unraveling the causes and pathogenesis of autism. Parents need to understand that they and their affected children are the only available sources for identifying and studying the elusive genes responsible for autism. Future clinically useful insights and potential medications depend on identifying these genes and elucidating the influences of their products on brain development and physiology."

Early human development	2004	S Lutchmaya, S Baron-Cohen, P Raggatt, R Knickmeyer, J T Manning		The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length (2D:4D) is sexually dimorphic (mean 2D:4D is lower in males than females) and is thought to be fixed early in development. 2D:4D has been reported to be related to fetal growth, hand preference, autism, Asperger's syndrome, sperm counts, family size, age at myocardial infarction in men and breast cancer in women. There is indirect evidence that 2D:4D is established in utero and is negatively related to prenatal testosterone and positively with prenatal estradiol. However, there are no studies which show direct relationships between fetal testosterone (FT), fetal estradiol (FE) and 2D:4D.

15098953		Matching strategies in cognitive research with individuals with high-functioning autism: current practices, instrument biases, and recommendations.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2004	Laurent Mottron	Centre de Recherche Fernand Seguin and Département de Psychiatrie, Université de Montréal, Montréal, Canada. mottronl@istar.ca	A meta-analysis was performed on the 133 cognitive and behavioral papers in autism using comparison groups in the 1999-2002 period. High-functioning (average IQ: 84.7), adolescents (average, 14.4 years) are largely dominant. IQ is the most frequent matching variable in use (51.2%). The instruments that are most frequently used to determine IQ or general level are Wechsler scales (46.9%), British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS; 22.3%), and Raven Progressive Matrices (RPM; 16.9%). In order to determine if these instruments were equivalent when applied to individuals with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), Wechsler IQ, EVIP (a French Canadian translation of the BPVS), and RPM were given to a group of 14 individuals with autism and 12 with Asperger syndrome. Comparison of Wechsler and RPM IQs values, expressed as percentiles, to percentile values of EVIP score revealed that EVIP (and to a lesser extent RPM) considerably overestimates the level of all PDD participants as compared to Wechsler Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), or Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), whereas these instruments are reported to be strongly correlated in typically developing individuals. This study reveals that identification of objects from a verbal label--the BPVS-PPVT-EVIP task--is a peak of ability in high functioning individuals with PDDs. This peak of ability, even superior to that of block design, has a detrimental effect on matching based on this instrument. A recommendation to replace BPVS/PPVT/EVIP or RPM by Wechsler scale as a basis of IQ/level matching is provided. Accordingly, the former instruments are a potential source of type-1 (for cognitive deficits) or type-2 (for cognitive hyperfunctioning) errors.

Journal of medical biography	2004	Muhammad Arshad, Michael Fitzgerald		In this paper evidence is presented that Michelangelo met the criteria for Asperger's disorder, or high-functioning autism. The evidence relates to his single-minded work routine, unusual lifestyle, limited interests, poor social and communication skills, and issues of life control. Depression and various medical conditions, including gout, renal colic and renal stones, did not stop his obsessive working habits.

Neuroreport	2004	Taina S Nieminen-von Wendt, Liisa Metsähonkala, Tuula A Kulomäki, Sargo Aalto, Taina H Autti, Raija Vanhala, Olli Eskola, Jörgen Bergman, Jarmo A Hietala, Lennart O von Wendt		The etiology of Asperger syndrome is essentially unknown, but abnormality of the dopamine system has been shown in clinically overlapping disorders. The present study was designed to investigate the presynaptic dopamine function in Asperger syndrome. Eight healthy, drug-free males with Asperger syndrome and five healthy male controls were examined with positron emission tomography using 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA ([18F]FDOPA) as a tracer. In the Asperger syndrome group, the [18F]FDOPA influx (Ki) values were increased in the striatum, i.e. in the putamen and caudate nucleus and in the frontal cortex. The results indicate that the dopamine system is affected in subjects with Asperger syndrome. Partially similar results have also been obtained in schizophrenia, suggesting an overlap not only of the clinical features but also of pathogenesis.
15072534		Effects of peer training and written text cueing on social communication of school-age children with pervasive developmental disorder.	Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR	2004	Kathy S Thiemann, Howard Goldstein		This study consecutively examined the effects of 2 social interventions-- peer training and written text treatment--on the social communication of 5 elementary students with pervasive developmental disorder. Each child with autism was paired with 2 peers without disabilities to form 5 triads. In Intervention 1 (peer training), peers were taught to use 5 facilitative social skills over 5 days. After peer training, 4 children with autism increased or used more stable rates of initiations and contingent responses overall. However, all children continued to demonstrate deficits in specific social-communication skills. Once Intervention 2 (direct instruction using written text cues) was implemented, increased use of 3 different communication skills was observed across all 5 participants. In addition, social validity outcomes revealed improved quality of child-peer interactions, 2 teacher reports of improved social skill development, and improved acceptance and friendship ratings for the children with autism. Results support the use of written text cues to improve children's social communication with peers, and suggest that combining approaches may be necessary to improve the quality of children's relationships.

15053835		Does routine child health surveillance contribute to the early detection of children with pervasive developmental disorders? An epidemiological study in Kent, U.K.	BMC pediatrics	2004	Marc Tebruegge, Vridhagiri Nandini, Jane Ritchie		Recently changed guidelines for child health surveillance in the United Kingdom (U.K.) suggest targeted checks only, instead of the previously conducted routine or universal screening at 2 years and 3.5 years. There are concerns that these changes could lead to a delay in the detection of children with autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD). Recent U.K. studies have suggested that the prevalence of PDD is much higher than previously estimated. This study establishes to which extent the routine checks contributed to the early detection and assessment of cases of PDD. Simultaneously we have evaluated the process involved and estimate the prevalence of PDD in our district.
15048895		Abnormal imitation-related cortical activation sequences in Asperger's syndrome.	Annals of neurology	2004	Nobuyuki Nishitani, Sari Avikainen, Riitta Hari		Subjects with Asperger's syndrome (AS) are impaired in social interaction and imitation, but the underlying brain mechanisms are poorly understood. Because the mirror-neuron system (MNS) that matches observed and executed actions has been suggested to play an important role in imitation and in reading of other people's intentions, we assessed MNS functions in 8 adult AS subjects and in 10 healthy control subjects during imitation of still pictures of lip forms. In the control subjects, cortical activation progressed in 30 to 80-millisecond steps from the occipital cortex to the superior temporal sulcus, to the inferior parietal lobe, and to the inferior frontal lobe, and finally, 75 to 90 milliseconds later, to the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres. Similar activation sites were found in AS subjects but with slightly larger scatter. Activation of the inferior frontal lobe was delayed by 45 to 60 milliseconds and activations in the inferior frontal lobe and in the primary motor cortex were weaker than in control subjects. The observed abnormal premotor and motor processing could account for a part of imitation and social impairments in subjects with AS.

15024396		Association of the homeobox transcription factor, ENGRAILED 2, 3, with autism spectrum disorder.	Molecular psychiatry	2004	N Gharani, R Benayed, V Mancuso, L M Brzustowicz, J H Millonig		Mouse mutants of the homeobox transcription factor Engrailed2 (En2) and autistic individuals display similar cerebellar morphological abnormalities, which include hypoplasia and a decrease in the number of Purkinje cells. Human EN2 maps to 7q36, a chromosomal region that has demonstrated suggestive linkage to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To investigate EN2 for evidence of association with ASD, four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs3735653, rs1861972, rs1861973, rs2361689) that span the majority of the 8.0 kb gene were assessed by the transmission/disequilibrium test. Initially, 138 triads of autistic individuals and their parents were tested. Two intronic SNPs (rs1861972 and rs1861973) demonstrated significant association with autism (rs1861972, P=0.0018; rs1861973, P=0.0003; haplotype, P=0.000005). Flanking exonic SNPs (rs3735653 and rs2361689) did not display association. This analysis was then extended to include 167 small nuclear ASD pedigrees and significant association was again only observed for rs1861972 and rs1861973 under both the narrow and broad diagnostic criteria (narrow: rs1861972 P=0.0290, rs1861973 P=0.0073, haplotype P=0.0009; broad: rs1861972 P=0.0175, rs1861973 P=0.0107, haplotype P=0.0024). These data demonstrate association between a cerebellar patterning gene and ASD, suggesting a role for EN2 as a susceptibility locus and supporting a neurodevelopmental defect hypothesis in the etiology of autism.

Revista de neurologia	2004	J A Muñoz Yunta, M Palau Baduell, B Salvado Salvado, C Amo, A Fernandez Lucas, F Maestu, T Ortiz		Autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) is a term that is not included in DSM IV or in ICD 10, which are the diagnostic tools most commonly used by clinical professionals but can offer problems in research when it comes to finding homogenous groups.
14999173		Subject selection and characterization in clinical trials in children with autism.	CNS spectrums	2004	Lawrence Scahill, Catherine Lord		The goal of psychopharmacologic research in autism is to provide guidance to clinicians and families on the risks and benefits of specific interventions. Careful subject selection and subject characterization in clinical trials are necessary for replication, to inform clinicians about the sample, and to elucidate the type of patients who might benefit from the treatment. At minimum, subject characterization includes demographic information, diagnosis (autism, Asperger's syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified), intellectual functioning, adaptive functioning, symptom severity, general behavioral profile, health status, pertinent clinical laboratory measures, height, weight, current treatments, and educational placements. Subject selection, sample size, and choice of the primary outcome measure are closely interrelated and linked to the study hypothesis. The magnitude of expected improvement on the primary outcome measure, which can be expressed by effect size, has direct implications for sample size. Large sample sizes are required to detect small effect sizes. To facilitate interpretation of study results, research reports should provide descriptive characteristics of the sample as well as the mean change and standard deviation on the primary outcome measure data to permit calculation of the effect size.
14998891		Functional neuroimaging of social cognition in pervasive developmental disorders: a brief review.	Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences	2003	Adriana Di Martino, F Xavier Castellanos		An emerging literature on the neuroanatomical correlates of social cognition in pervasive developmental disorders is reviewed. Studies conducted with high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger's syndrome highlight patterns of decreased activation in ventromedial prefrontal cortex, temporo-parietal junction, amygdala, and periamygdaloid cortex, along with aberrantly increased activation in primary sensory cortices. Future studies should extend these important initial results to younger and more severely affected subjects.
14993117		Investigation of neuroanatomical differences between autism and Asperger syndrome.	Archives of general psychiatry	2004	Linda J Lotspeich, Hower Kwon, Cynthia M Schumann, Susanna L Fryer, Beth L Goodlin-Jones, Michael H Buonocore, Cathy R Lammers, David G Amaral, Allan L Reiss		Autism and Asperger syndrome (ASP) are neurobiological conditions with overlapping behavioral symptoms and of unknown etiologies. Results from previous autism neuroimaging studies have been difficult to replicate, possibly owing to site differences in subject samples, scanning procedures, and image-processing methods. We sought (1) to determine whether low-functioning autism (LFA; IQ<70), high-functioning autism (HFA; IQ>or=70), and ASP constitute distinct biological entities as evidenced by neuroanatomical measures, and (2) to assess for intersite differences.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2004	L Dorris, C A E Espie, F Knott, J Salt		Previous research suggests that the phenotype associated with Asperger's syndrome (AS) includes difficulties in understanding the mental states of others, leading to difficulties in social communication and social relationships. It has also been suggested that the first-degree relatives of those with AS can demonstrate similar difficulties, albeit to a lesser extent. This study examined 'theory of mind' (ToM) abilities in the siblings of children with AS relative to a matched control group.
14981336		Asperger syndrome, alexithymia and perception of sleep.	Neuropsychobiology	2004	Pekka Tani, Nina Lindberg, Matti Joukamaa, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Björn Appelberg, Ranan Rimón, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen		Two research traditions, the one on Asperger syndrome (AS) and the other on alexithymia, have produced similar findings independently of each other indicating a possible association between these two phenomena. Both conditions are also associated with impaired initiation and continuity of sleep. Twenty AS adults were compared with 10 healthy controls using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire. AS subjects were significantly more alexithymic and reported lower sleep quality as compared with controls. AS and alexithymia are associated although the mediating factors are unknown. It is possible that alexithymic traits predispose to anxiety, which in turn lowers the sleep quality in AS adults. Alternatively, low sleep quality might be due to AS itself.

14972707		Inner and outer face perception in children with autism.	Child neuropsychology : a journal on normal and abnormal development in childhood and adolescence	2003	Cecilie Rondan, Bruno Gepner, Christine Deruelle		Possible peculiarities in face perception in the autistic population were explored through two experiments. Fourteen autistic children (mean age=10 years 1 month) were individually matched to verbal mental age (VMA) and chronological age (CA) subjects. In a first experiment, subjects were to match faces on the basis of either their outer (hair, chin, ears) or their inner (eyes, nose, mouth) aspects. Autistic children performed equally well in both conditions, while VMA-matched children performed better in the outer than the inner part condition. In a second experiment, chimeric faces consisting of the outer part of an individual's face and the inner part of another individual's face were presented to the subjects. None of the groups showed a preference for neither the outer nor the inner part of the face in this condition. Results were discussed in terms of the existence of a local visual processing strategy in this population.
14966474		Genome-wide scan for loci of Asperger syndrome.	Molecular psychiatry	2004	T Ylisaukko-oja, T Nieminen-von Wendt, E Kempas, S Sarenius, T Varilo, L von Wendt, L Peltonen, I Järvelä		Asperger syndrome (AS), characterised by inadequate social interaction, lack of empathy and a dependence of routines and rituals, is classified as belonging to the autism spectrum disorders (DSM-IV and ICD-10). Although the prevalence of AS has been estimated to range from 0.3 up to 48.4 per 10 000, the phenotype still remains relatively unrecognised by clinicians. Several reports, including the original description by Hans Asperger (1944), have suggested that AS has a strong genetic component. Here, we have performed a genome-wide scan on Finnish families ascertained for AS with a strictly defined phenotype. In the initial scan, Z(max)>1.5 was observed on nine chromosomal regions, 1q21-22, 3p14-24, 3q25-27, 4p14, 4q32, 6p25, 6q16, 13q31-33 and 18p11. In the fine mapping stage, the highest two-point LOD scores were observed on chromosomes 1q21-22 (D1S484, Z(max dom)=3.58), 3p14-24 (D3S2432, Z(max dom)=2.50) and 13q31-33 (D13S793, Z(max dom)=1.59). The loci on 1q21-22 and 3p14-24 overlap with previously published autism susceptibility loci, and the loci on 1q21-22 and 13q31-33 overlap with the reported schizophrenia susceptibility loci. The present study is the first genome-wide screen in AS and therefore replication data sets are needed to evaluate further the significance of the AS-loci identified here.
14962402		Frontal lobe dysfunction and everyday problem-solving: social and non-social contributions.	Acta psychologica	2004	Shelley Channon	Subdepartment of Clinical Health, Department of Psychology, University College London, UCL, Gower Street, London WC1E 6BT, UK.	Everyday problem-solving involves both non-social executive processes, social and emotional processes, and draws upon social and practical knowledge. A series of studies including both adult-acquired lesions and neurodevelopmental disorders is reviewed examining problem-solving on a real-life-type task that involves generating a range of solutions to brief problem scenarios and selecting preferred solutions to solve the problems. Impairments in problem-solving are described in groups of participants with left anterior frontal lobe lesions, Tourette's syndrome and Asperger's syndrome. By contrast, healthy older people did not show problem-solving deficits on the same task. The possible contributions of non-social executive skills, social and emotional skills, and knowledge acquired from experience are each considered in relation to everyday performance. Multiple cognitive/emotional routes to the development of everyday life difficulties pose a complex challenge both in understanding the nature of the relevant processes and in developing adequate methods for management and rehabilitation.

14959806		Autism and pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2004	Fred R Volkmar, Catherine Lord, Anthony Bailey, Robert T Schultz, Ami Klin		The quantity and quality of research into autism and related conditions have increased dramatically in recent years. Consequently we selectively review key accomplishments and highlight directions for future research. More consistent approaches to diagnosis and more rigorous assessment methods have significantly advanced research, although the boundaries of the 'broader phenotype' remain to be defined and the validity of Asperger's disorder as a discrete syndrome remains controversial. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that Autism Spectrum Disorders are common, but there continues to be debate about the causes of the increase in the frequency with which autism is diagnosed. Psychological research has helped to develop new developmental models for the disorder and there have also been significant advances in the molecular genetics of autism and understanding of the underlying neurobiological processes. Areas important for future research include the study of autism as it first develops, i.e., in infants and very young children, and of specific processes (psychological and neurobiological) which underlie the disorder. Significant challenges lie ahead in evaluating the growing number of treatments for autism and in integrating the results of research into treatment and educational settings.

14640308		Why bother about clumsiness? The implications of having developmental coordination disorder (DCD).	Neural plasticity	2003	Christopher Gillberg, Björn Kadesjö		Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is a common motor problem affecting--even in rather severe form--several percent of school age children. In the past, DCD has usually been called 'clumsy child syndrome' or 'non-cerebral-palsy motor-perception dysfunction'. This disorder is more common in boys than in girls and is very often associated with psychopathology, particularly with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorders/ autistic-type problems. Conversely, children with ADHD and autism spectrum problems, particularly those given a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, have a very high rate of comorbid DCD. Psychiatrists appear to be unaware of this type of comorbidity in their young patients. Neurologists, on the other hand, usually pay little attention to the striking behavioral and emotional problems shown by so many of their 'clumsy' patients. A need exists for a much clearer focus on DCD-in child psychiatry and in child neurology-both in research and in clinical practice.
14633433		The use of observation in the psychoanalytic treatment of a 12-year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome.	The International journal of psycho-analysis	2003	Maria E Pozzi	maria@pozzi-monzo.freeserve.co.uk	The author describes some aspects of a once-weekly psychoanalytic psychotherapy of a 12-year-old boy diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. The patient's emotional and cognitive development had been impaired since early life, possibly due to an internal deficit and to the likelihood of inadequate environmental holding. He was unaware of having difficulties but was underachieving academically, was socially isolated and often visibly unhappy in his life. The patient's denial, splitting, and projection of emotion and insight presented the therapist with the difficult task of how to reach him. In order to communicate with him emotionally, the therapist created a modified technique which reflected the patient's development from part-object to whole-object relationships. This development became apparent in the sessions and was interpreted in the transference relationship. An account of the patient's early years was pieced together from a detailed commentary of what was being observed and intuited by the therapist during the sessions, as well as by an understanding of the countertransference. By the end of two years' treatment, the patient's sensitivity and creativity, which had been buried beneath a self-sufficient, autistic-like encapsulation, finally began to emerge in his communications with his therapist.

14594330		The Friendship Questionnaire: an investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, and normal sex differences.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright		Friendship is an important part of normal social functioning, yet there are precious few instruments for measuring individual differences in this domain. In this article, we report a new self-report questionnaire, the Friendship Questionnaire (FQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. A high score on the FQ is achieved by the respondent reporting that they enjoy close, empathic, supportive, caring friendships that are important to them; that they like and are interested in people; and that they enjoy interacting with others for its own sake. The FQ has a maximum score of 135 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1, we carried out a study of n = 76 (27 males and 49 females) adults from a general population, to test for previously reported sex differences in friendships. This confirmed that women scored significantly higher than men. In Study 2, we employed the FQ with n = 68 adults (51 males, 17 females) with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism to test the theory that autism is an extreme form of the male brain. The adults with Asperger Syndrome or high-functioning autism scored significantly lower on the FQ than both the male and female controls from Study 1. The FQ thus reveals both a sex difference in the style of friendship in the general population, and provides support for the extreme male brain theory of autism.
14593431		Serotonin transporter missense mutation associated with a complex neuropsychiatric phenotype.	Molecular psychiatry	2003	N Ozaki, D Goldman, W H Kaye, K Plotnicov, B D Greenberg, J Lappalainen, G Rudnick, D L Murphy		Two common serotonin transporter (SERT) untranslated region gene variants have been intensively studied, but remain inconclusively linked to depression and other neuropsychiatric disorders. We now report an uncommon coding region SERT mutation, Ile425Val, in two unrelated families with OCD and other serotonin-related disorders. Six of the seven family members with this mutation had OCD (n=5) or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (n=1) and some also met diagnostic criteria for multiple other disorders (Asperger's syndrome, social phobia, anorexia nervosa, tic disorder and alcohol and other substance abuse/dependence). The four most clinically affected individuals--the two probands and their two slbs--had the I425V SERT gene gain-of-function mutation and were also homozygous for 5'-UTR SERT gene variant with greater transcriptional efficacy.

14577289		[Delinquency by a juvenile with pervasive developmental disorder: a case in which interaction between disorder and family dysfunction played a key role].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2003	Takahiro Kurumatani, Mahoko Yamashita		Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) is characterized by peculiar psycho-behavioral patterns. Youths with PDD who commit delinquent acts often exhibit strange behavior beyond ordinary comprehension. In order to fully understand and identify PDD it is important to take a comprehensive psychosocial history. Here we report on a 19-year-old delinquent male from a juvenile detention home who was exhibiting PDD. Both the psycho-behavioral patterns of the subject and the dysfunctional family background were key factors in this case. The subject persistently stalked and harassed an elementary school girl despite repeated intervention by police and the girl's parents to stop doing so. This behavior culminated in the subject being arrested and put on probation. While on probation his behavior continued, leading to his arrest and confinement to a correctional facility for juveniles with medical needs. Several features that included sustained impairment in social interaction and repetitive patterns of behavior that are often identified in delinquents with PDD were found to exist in the subject and he was diagnosed with PDD (probably Asperger's disease). The subject presented with a superficial understanding of the consequences his behavior had on others and for himself. Also, impaired family function was found to be a major contributing factor to his delinquency. Together theses factors hindered the subject from acquiring appropriate social skills. The major responsibility for providing care and support of an individual with PDD is within the family. Failure of the family to undertake such responsibilities can lead to ineffective treatment even after a specialist has identified the disorder. Given the slow decline of the nuclear family in Japan, it is important to understand the role of the family in caring for a child with PDD. Also, public recognition of PDD and social support for individuals with the disorder is important.
14577288		[Developmental consideration on the loss of self-evidence (natürlichen Selbstverständlichkeit) in pervasive developmental disorders].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2003	Ryuji Kobayashi	Faculty of Social Work, Tokai University School of Health Sciences.	"The ""loss of self-evidence"" has been noted by many, particularly in our country, as a fundamental dysfunction in schizophrenia. Recent recognition of this ""loss of self-evidence"" in personality disorders such as borderline cases, and developmental disorders such as autism and Asperger's syndrome is focusing renewed interest on this perspective. It is possible that investigation into this ""loss of self-evidence"" noted in the pervasive developmental disorders may provide clues into the process of its development and acquisition. This paper takes up the issue of ""loss of self-evidence"" illustrated through the treatment process of 2 patients (female, adulthood autism, adolescent Asperger's syndrome) the author has treated. The psychopathology of the ""loss of self-evidence"" seen in the pervasive developmental disorders is discussed through these cases in terms of development from the standpoint of clinical intervention for relationship disturbance. The conclusions are as follows. First, the grave psychopathology pertaining to ""self-evidence"" in the adult autism and adolescent Asperger's syndrome cases is discussed, wherein difficulty in controlling one's action by one's own will giving rise to serious estrangement between experience and consciousness is noted as the pathology held in common by the two. Next, through examination of the normal acquisition process of words and language, it is shown that the essence of the language disorder seen in pervasive developmental disorders lies in the acquisition of meanings of objects being based upon the absence of common experience between subject and caregiver. As such, words representing meaning and content as we see them are imprinted on such individuals, never harmonizing with their own experiential world, giving rise to serious estrangement between their experience and consciousness. Third, sharing what the child is focusing upon in the outer world and how he/she is relating to it in their experiential world, and approaching them with words appropriate to their interpretation, is pointed out as being of critical importance in the self-evidence. In support of this, it is asserted that the establishment of affective communication characterized by mutual resonance of body and affect, and the development of communication upon this basis will, for the first time, enable transmission of culture to such individuals in favorable form, emphasizing the exceptional importance of attachment formation (amae) as being the key to this process."

BMC psychiatry	2003	Pekka Tani, Nina Lindberg, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Lennart von Wendt, Lauri Alanko, Björn Appelberg, Tarja Porkka-Heiskanen		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder belonging to autism spectrum disorders with prevalence rate of 0,35% in school-age children. It has been most extensively studied in childhood while there is scarcity of reports concerning adulthood of AS subjects despite the lifelong nature of this syndrome. In children with Asperger syndrome the initiation and continuity of sleep is disturbed because of the neuropsychiatric deficits inherent of AS. It is probable that sleep difficulties are present in adulthood as well. Our hypothesis was that adults with AS suffer from difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep and nonrestorative sleep (insomnia).
14561452		Functional anatomy of impaired selective attention and compensatory processing in autism.	Brain research. Cognitive brain research	2003	Matthew K Belmonte, Deborah A Yurgelun-Todd		In autism, physiological indices of selective attention have been shown to be abnormal even in situations where behaviour is intact. This divergence between behaviour and physiology suggests the action of some compensatory process of attention, one which may hold clues to the aetiology of autism's characteristic cognitive phenotype. Six subjects with autism spectrum disorders and six normal control subjects were studied with functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a bilateral visual spatial attention task. In normal subjects, the task evoked activation in a network of cortical regions including the superior parietal lobe (P<0.001), left middle temporal gyrus (P=0.002), left inferior (P<0.001) and middle (P<0.02) frontal gyri, and medial frontal gyrus (P<0.02). Autistic subjects, in contrast, showed activation in the bilateral ventral occipital cortex (P<0.03) and striate cortex (P<0.05). Within the task condition, a region-of-interest comparison of attend-left versus attend-right conditions indicated that modulation of activation in the autistic brain as a function of the lateral focus of spatial attention was abnormally decreased in the left ventral occipital cortex (P<0.03), abnormally increased in the left intraparietal sulcus (P<0.01), and abnormally variable in the superior parietal lobe (P<0.03). These results are discussed in terms of a model of autism in which a pervasive defect of neural and synaptic development produces over-connected neural systems prone to noise and crosstalk, resulting in hyper-arousal and reduced selectivity. These low-level attentional traits may be the developmental basis for higher-order cognitive styles such as weak central coherence.
14516061		Use of a Social Story intervention to improve mealtime skills of an adolescent with Asperger syndrome.

14516059		Developmental changes of autistic symptoms.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2003	Shirley Fecteau, Laurent Mottron, Claude Berthiaume, Jacob A Burack		The study examined developmental changes in autistic symptoms retrospectively in a sample of 28 verbal children and adolescents with autism. Individuals with Asperger syndrome, PDD-NOS, and related medical conditions were not included in the study. We compared autistic symptoms present at the retrospective assessment and during the 4- to 5-year age period using the ADI-R. Our findings revealed a significant improvement in the three domains relevant for the diagnosis of autism, independent of age or IQ level. Improvement occurred in more symptoms from the social than the communication domain, and for more symptoms from the latter than the restricted interest and repetitive behavior domains. The finding that improvement was not linked to level of functioning and was found in individuals still positive for a diagnosis of autism suggests that improvement belongs to the 'natural history' of the handicap.
14515138		Evidence for allelic association on chromosome 3q25-27 in families with autism spectrum disorders originating from a subisolate of Finland.	Molecular psychiatry	2003	M Auranen, T Varilo, R Alen, R Vanhala, K Ayers, E Kempas, T Ylisaukko-Oja, L Peltonen, I Järvelä		Recent molecular studies on autism and related disorders have supported a multilocus etiology for the disease spectrum. To maximize genetic and cultural homogeneity, we have focused our molecular studies to families originating from a subisolate of Central Finland. Genealogical studies enabled the identification of a megapedigree comprising of 12 core families with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS). We analyzed two chromosomal regions on Iq and 3q showing highest lod scores in our genome-wide scan, as well as the AUTS1 locus on chromosome 7q. For markers on 3q25-27, more significant association was observed in families from subisolate compared to families from the rest of Finland. In contrast, no clear evidence for association on AUTS1 locus was obtained. The wide interval showing association, in particular, on chromosome 3q suggests a locus for autism spectrum of disorders on this chromosomal region.

The diagnosis of Asperger syndrome is increasingly common, and it is timely to review its phenomenology and treatment.
14505068		Changes in cerebral blood flow in Asperger syndrome during theory of mind tasks presented by the auditory route.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2003	Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Liisa Metsähonkala, Tuula Kulomäki, Sargo Aalto, Taina Autti, Raija Vanhala, Lennart von Wendt		Lack of theory of mind (ToM) has been considered to be a key feature in Asperger syndrome (AS). The main aim of the present study was to determine whether an exclusively auditory input of ToM stories activated the same brain areas as demonstrated previously using visual stimuli. Eight right-handed otherwise healthy men with AS and eight healthy right-handed male controls participated in a PET activation study using auditory given ToM stories and stories about physical events for induction. Both subjects with AS and controls showed increased activation in the occipitotemporal area bilaterally and in thalamus during ToM tasks. Both groups also showed activation in the medial frontal area during ToM tests.However, this activation was more intensive and extensive in the control group, especially when a more sensitive analysis method was used. As a group, unrelated to the tasks, the AS subjects showed increased activation of the cerebellum. It was concluded that the activation pattern was mainly in agreement with earlier studies using comparable stimuli administered differently. There was no support for a right hemisphere specific dysfunction.

12959421		Validation of a brief quantitative measure of autistic traits: comparison of the social responsiveness scale with the autism diagnostic interview-revised.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	John N Constantino, Sandra A Davis, Richard D Todd, Matthew K Schindler, Maggie M Gross, Susan L Brophy, Lisa M Metzger, Christiana S Shoushtari, Reagan Splinter, Wendy Reich		Studies of the broader autism phenotype, and of subtle changes in autism symptoms over time, have been compromised by a lack of established quantitative assessment tools. The Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-formerly known as the Social Reciprocity Scale) is a new instrument that can be completed by parents and/or teachers in 15-20 minutes. We compared the SRS with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) in 61 child psychiatric patients. Correlations between SRS scores and ADI-R algorithm scores for DSM-IV criterion sets were on the order of 0.7. SRS scores were unrelated to I.Q. and exhibited inter-rater reliability on the order of 0.8. The SRS is a valid quantitative measure of autistic traits, feasible for use in clinical settings and for large-scale research studies of autism spectrum conditions.
12959419		Autism families with a high incidence of alcoholism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Judith H Miles, T Nicole Takahashi, Andrew Haber, Laura Hadden		To determine the significance of neuropsychiatric disorders in autism families, we analyzed 167 pedigrees ascertained through an autistic child; 39% had alcoholism in patterns consistent with transmission of a genetic trait. Children from high alcoholism families were more likely to have the onset of their autistic behavior occur with a loss of language (52.5% vs. 35.8%, p = 0.04). This occurred primarily in families where the mother was alcoholic (80% vs. 40%, p = 0.05), suggesting an association between maternal alcoholism and regressive onset autism. Children from high alcoholism families were less likely to be macrocephalic (14.7% vs. 40.6%, p = 0.0006). Children from high alcohol and low alcohol families did not differ in dysmorphology status, IQ, sex ratio or sib recurrence risk.
12959417		Sibling relationships when a child has autism: marital stress and support coping.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Jessica Wood Rivers, Zolinda Stoneman		Family systems theory was employed to study sibling relationships in 50 families with a child with autism. Typically developing siblings expressed satisfaction with their sibling relationships. Parents were somewhat less positive about the sibling relationship than were the siblings themselves. As hypothesized, stress in the marital relationship was associated with compromised sibling relationships. Informal social support buffered the deleterious effects of marital stress on positive, but not negative, aspects of the sibling relationship. Contrary to predictions, families experiencing high marital stress who sought greater support from formal resources external to the family had typically developing siblings who reported a higher level of negative sibling behaviors than families who sought low levels of formal support. Findings reinforce the importance of considering family context as a contributor to the quality of the sibling relationship.
12959416		Epidemiological surveys of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders: an update.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Eric Fombonne	McGill University, Department of Psychiatry, The Montreal Children's Hospital, 4018 St. Catherine St. W., Montreal, QC H3Z 1P2, Canada. eric.fombonne@mcgill.ca	This paper was commissioned by the committee on the Effectiveness of Early Education in Autism of the National Research Council (NRC). It provides a review of epidemiological studies of pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) which updates a previously published article (The epidemiology of autism: a review. Psychological Medicine 1999; 29: 769-786). The design, sample characteristics of 32 surveys published between 1966 and 2001 are described. Recent surveys suggest that the rate for all forms of PDDs are around 30/10,000 but more recent surveys suggest that the estimate might be as high as 60/10,000. The rate for Asperger disorder is not well established, and a conservative figure is 2.5/10,000. Childhood disintegrative disorder is extremely rare with a pooled estimate across studies of 0.2/10,000. A detailed discussion of the possible interpretations of trends over time in prevalence rates is provided. There is evidence that changes in case definition and improved awareness explain much of the upward trend of rates in recent decades. However, available epidemiological surveys do not provide an adequate test of the hypothesis of a changing incidence of PDDs.
12954440		Autism: a large unmet medical need and a complex research problem.	Physiology & behavior	2003	Julia Gerlai, Robert Gerlai		"Autism has been becoming the focus of attention as its apparently increasing prevalence is better appreciated. According to some estimates, the frequency of children with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) can be as high as 1 in 150. The diagnosis can be made as early as 2 years of age, and autistic patients often have a normal life span. Thus, in terms of the number of ""patient years,"" ASD represents a market that is as large as that of the biggest neurological indication, Alzheimer's disease. Despite the clear unmet medical need, no effective treatment is available. This may be because the mechanism of ASD is not understood. The aim of the present paper is to review recent advances in autism research and to discuss some of the most stressing problems mainly from a preclinical research standpoint. We hope to draw attention to the need to study this devastating disease that places an enormous burden on the society in general and the relatives and caregivers of autistic patients in particular."

22033547		Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders.	Dialogues in clinical neuroscience	2003	Andrea Allen, Audrey King, Eric Hollander		The obsessive-compulsive spectrum is an important concept referring to a number of disorders drawn from several diagnostic categories that share core obsessive-compulsive features. These disorders can be grouped by the focus of their symptoms: bodily preoccupation, impulse control, or neurological disorders. Although the disorders are clearly distinct from one another, they have intriguing similarities in phenomenology, etiology, pathophysiology, patient characteristics, and treatment response. In combination with the knowledge gained through many years of research on obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the concept of a spectrum has generated much fruitful research on the spectrum disorders. It has become apparent that these disorders can also be viewed as being on a continuum of compulsivity to impulsivity, characterized by harm avoidance at the compulsive end and risk seeking at the impulsive end. The compulsive and impulsive disorders differ in systematic ways that are just beginning to be understood. Here, we review these concepts and several representative obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders including both compulsive and impulsive disorders, as well as the three different symptom clusters: OCD, body dysmorphic disorder, pathological gambling, sexual compulsivity, and autism spectrum disorders.
12937074		Absence of auditory 'global interference' in autism.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2003	Jessica M Foxton, Mary E Stewart, Louise Barnard, Jacqui Rodgers, Allan H Young, Gregory O'Brien, Timothy D Griffiths		There has been considerable recent interest in the cognitive style of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). One theory, that of weak central coherence, concerns an inability to combine stimulus details into a coherent whole. Here we test this theory in the case of sound patterns, using a new definition of the details (local structure) and the coherent whole (global structure). Thirteen individuals with a diagnosis of autism or Asperger's syndrome and 15 control participants were administered auditory tests, where they were required to match local pitch direction changes between two auditory sequences. When the other local features of the sequence pairs were altered (the actual pitches and relative time points of pitch direction change), the control participants obtained lower scores compared with when these details were left unchanged. This can be attributed to interference from the global structure, defined as the combination of the local auditory details. In contrast, the participants with ASD did not obtain lower scores in the presence of such mismatches. This was attributed to the absence of interference from an auditory coherent whole. The results are consistent with the presence of abnormal interactions between local and global auditory perception in ASD.
12916490		Disorders of face perception and recognition.	Neurologic clinics	2003	Jason J Barton	Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA. jbarton@caregroup.harvard.edu	Face recognition is one of the most complex visual tasks performed by the human brain. Data from monkeys suggest that area IT may play a key role in identifying faces, and functional imaging research suggests that the human homologue of IT may be located in the medial occipitotemporal cortex, where a FFA has been located. Damage to medial occipitotemporal structures on the right or bilaterally leads to prosopagnosia, the failure to recognize facial identity. Prosopagnosia is not a single functional disorder but a family of dysfunctions, with different patients having different degrees of impairments to various perceptual and memory stages involved in face processing. Understanding the perceptual basis of this disorder and epiphenomena, such as covert recognition, is a goal of current research. Deficits in face perception also may contribute to Capgras syndrome and may be related to the impaired social development of patients with Asperger syndrome. More recently, identified deficits in face processing include the false recognition of unfamiliar faces and the impaired extraction of social information from faces, independent of the recognition of identity. Many of these prosopagnosia and other face processing deficits can be placed in the context of cognitive models of face processing stages, which are being refined continually by data from neurologic patients and functional imaging in normal subjects.
12908836		The HOXA1 A218G polymorphism and autism: lack of association in white and black patients from the South Carolina Autism Project.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Julianne S Collins, Richard J Schroer, Jeffrey Bird, Ron C Michaelis		A recent study has suggested that the A218G polymorphism in the homeobox A1 (HOXA1) gene may influence susceptibility to autism. We have determined the frequencies of the A and G alleles of the HOXA1 A218G polymorphism in both white and black patients from the South Carolina Autism Project (SCAP) and controls. Marked differences were found in allele frequencies between the races, but no deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were seen in either white or black SCAP family members. More direct tests, comparing genotype frequencies between probands and controls and tracking transmission of the A versus G alleles to affected offspring, did not support the contention that allele status for the HOXA1 A218G polymorphism influences one's susceptibility to autism.
12908829		Further evidence of preserved priming and impaired recall in adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	John M Gardiner, Dermot M Bowler, Sarah J Grice		Two experiments compared incidental (implicit) and intentional (explicit) memory performance in adults with Asperger's syndrome and individually matched controls. Experiment 1 involved perceptual tests using word fragment cues, following study tasks in which the participants either generated the words from contextual cues or read the words alone, with no contextual cues. Experiment 2 involved conceptual tests using paired associate cues, following study tasks in which the paired associates were rated either for their relatedness or for their readability. Performance in both the incidental tests was similar for both groups. Performance in both the intentional tests was also similar for both groups, with one exception. The adults with Asperger's syndrome were more likely to falsely recall words that had not actually been studied. These findings further delimit the nature of memory impairments in adults with Asperger's syndrome, which seem restricted to certain aspects of episodic memory that include the tendency to make more intrusion errors in recall.
12908828		The comprehension of humorous materials by adolescents with high-functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	David M Emerich, Nancy A Creaghead, Sandra M Grether, Donna Murray, Carol Grasha		This study investigated the ability of adolescents with Asperger's syndrome or high-functioning autism and an age-matched group of typical adolescents to comprehend humorous materials. The analysis of humor focused on picking funny endings for cartoons and jokes. As expected, the adolescents with autism had significantly poorer comprehension of cartoons and jokes. Both groups had more difficulty with the joke than the cartoon task, but when compared with the typical group, the adolescents with autism performed significantly poorer. Examination of the error patterns revealed that subjects with autism had difficulty handling surprise and coherence within humorous narratives.
12908827		Narrative ability in high-functioning children with autism or Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Molly Losh, Lisa Capps		This study examines the narrative abilities of 28 high-functioning children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome and 22 typically developing children across two different discourse contexts. As compared with the typically developing children, the high-functioning group performed relatively well in the storybook context but exhibited difficulty imbuing their narratives of personal experience with the more sophisticated characteristics typically employed by the comparison group. Furthermore, children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome demonstrated impairments inferring and building on the underlying causal relationships both within and across story episodes in both narrative contexts. Findings further revealed that the narrative abilities of children with autism or Asperger's Syndrome were associated with performance on measures of emotional understanding, but not theory of mind or verbal IQ. Findings are discussed in relation to the social and emotional underpinnings of narrative discourse.
12908751		Rett syndrome as a minicolumnopathy.	Clinical neuropathology	2003	M F Casanova, D Buxhoeveden, A Switala, E Roy		Rett syndrome is a progressive neurological disorder affecting primarily females. It is characterized by the early regression of acquired language, cognitive functions, social skills, and purposeful hand function. Patients with Rett syndrome are often misdiagnosed as autistic. Recent reports of minicolumnar abnormalities in the brains of autistic and Asperger's syndrome prompted us to search for similar pathology in Rett syndrome.
12880798		In search of the hidden: an fMRI study with implications for the study of patients with autism and with acquired brain injury.	NeuroImage	2003	Zina M Manjaly, John C Marshall, Klaas E Stephan, Jennifer M Gurd, Karl Zilles, Gereon R Fink		The Embedded Figures Task involves a search for a target hidden in a more complex visual pattern. The task has been used to study local perception and visual search in a range of normal and pathological populations. After acquired brain damage, impairment on embedded figures is strongly associated with aphasia; in the context of developmental disorder, people with autism or with Asperger's syndrome are reliably found to be better than normal controls on the task. The current study employed functional MRI with healthy volunteers to elucidate the brain regions that are specifically involved in the local search aspects of the Embedded Figures Task. We did so by analyzing the neural activations that are implicated in the task over and above those involved in an easier visual search task and in a straightforward shape recognition task. Significant activations (P < 0.05, corrected) specific in the above sense to the Embedded Figures Task were found in left inferior and left superior parietal cortex and in left ventral premotor cortex (inferior frontal gyrus). By contrast, comparing the overall effect of visual search within geometric figures to pure recognition of geometric shapes revealed more widespread activations in parietal, occipital, cerebellar, and frontal areas bilaterally. The implications of these findings for some developmental and acquired pathologies of perceptual functioning are outlined. We also relate our results to studies of local/global processing in other tasks.

All the patients received 10 microinjections (intramuscularly and perinervously) of 0.1 ml CL daily during 5 days. Clinical study was combined with device estimation of cognitive functions and communicative skills. CL therapy resulted in improvement of cognitive functions (expressive and receptive speech, fine motoring, playing). Positive effects were revealed in all the patients with Asperger's syndrome and in 89% of the patients with childhood autism. Any negative effects were not found. With regard to cognitive functions development, therapeutic efficacy proved to be more pronounced in the patients with Asperger's syndrome as compared to childhood autistic group (p < 0.005).

12860373		Low prevalence of smoking in patients with autism spectrum disorders.	Psychiatry research	2003	Susanne Bejerot, Lena Nylander		Psychiatric patients are significantly more often smokers than the general population, the only known exception being obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and catatonic schizophrenia. We have investigated nicotine use in subjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Ninety-five subjects (25 females and 70 males) consecutively diagnosed with any ASD and of normal intelligence were included in the study. Only 12.6% were smokers, compared with 19% in the general population and 47% in a control group of 161 outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia or a schizophreniform disorder. The results suggest that smoking is rare among subjects with ASD, while the opposite was shown for schizophrenia. If replicated, this finding could suggest biological differences between non-catatonic schizophrenia and ASD, and support the theory of a biological link between ASD and a subtype of OCD, and between ASD and catatonic schizophrenia.

It is thus likely that physicians in adult psychiatric departments may see a number of patients with ASD. Identification of patients with ASD is helpful and important for rehabilitation. This study estimated the prevalence of ASD among adult psychiatric outpatients in a Taiwanese medical center. A total of 660 patients were screened with Nylander and Gillberg's ""Autism Spectrum Disorder in Adult Screening Questionnaire."" Patients with high scores then underwent a diagnostic clinical interview conducted by child psychiatrists. Four patients (0.6%) were found to have ASD."
12848436		Differences in assertive speech acts produced by children with autism, Asperger syndrome, specific language impairment, and normal development.	Development and psychopathology	2003	Kathryn Ziatas, Kevin Durkin, Chris Pratt		The assertive speech acts of children with autism (n = 12) and Asperger syndrome (n = 12), individually matched to children with specific language impairment (SLI; n = 24) and children with normal development (n = 24) were studied in the context of gently structured conversation. These children also completed the false belief test of theory of mind. The children with autism used significantly lower proportions of assertions involving explanations and descriptions than the children with SLI or normal development and significantly lower proportions of assertions involving internal state and explanations than the children with Asperger syndrome. The children with autism used a higher proportion of assertions involving identifications than any other group. The assertions of the children with Asperger syndrome were generally not different than those of the children with SLI or normal development except for a higher proportion of assertions involving own internal state. Further analysis of the mental assertions revealed that the children with autism and Asperger syndrome predominantly referred to desire and made few references to thought and belief, whereas the children with SLI and those with normal development used a higher proportion of references to thought and belief.

Archives of disease in childhood	2003	E Newson, K Le Maréchal, C David		"A proposal is made to recognise pathological demand avoidance syndrome (PDA) as a separate entity within the pervasive developmental disorders, instead of being classed under ""pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified"" (PDDnos, DSM-IV). Discriminant functions analysis shows PDA to be significantly different on many counts from classic autism and Asperger's syndrome, both separately and together, including an equal sex ratio (150 cases). Demand avoidance using social manipulation is seen in all children, which strongly contrasts with the features of autistic spectrum disorders. A criterial structure is described, supported by statistical data from a random sample of 50 children diagnosed with PDA, together with a follow up sample of 18 young adults."
12806492		Genetic and neurological evaluation in a sample of individuals with pervasive developmental disorders.	Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria	2003	Carlos Eduardo Steiner, Marilisa Mantovani Guerreiro, Antonia Paula Marques-de-Faria		With the aim of analyzing which complementary tests are relevant in the diagnostic evaluation of individuals with pervasive developmental disorders, a protocol of clinical and laboratory evaluation was applied in 103 outpatients. The protocol included chromosomal analysis, screening for inborn errors of metabolism, cytogenetic and molecular study of the FRAXA, FRAXE, and FRAXF mutations, EEG, SPECT, and magnetic resonance imaging study. Eighty-four subjects concluded the complementary tests and were classified either as having autism, atypical autism or Asperger syndrome according to the DSM-IV criteria. Sixteen individuals, all bellonging to the two autistic groups, presented genetic or enviromental factors that may have lead to the behavioral disorders, showing the importance of diagnostic evaluation in this group of conditions. Neuroimaging and EEG findings were non-specific and occurred in similar proportion among the groups, being considered of relative low significance in the diagnostic evaluation of individuals with pervasive developmental disorders.
12804129		Effectiveness of melatonin in the treatment of sleep disturbances in children with Asperger disorder.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2003	E Juulia Paavonen, Taina Nieminen-von Wendt, Raija Vanhala, Eeva T Aronen, Lennart von Wendt		Sleep disturbances are common in patients with Asperger disorder. Although these sleep problems are often persistent and may significantly impair the child's daytime well-being, no treatment studies have been reported. In this open clinical trial, the effectiveness of melatonin was studied in a sample of 15 children with Asperger disorder (13 boys, 2 girls) aged 6-17 years using several questionnaires and actigraph measurements. They included assessments of sleep quality, tiredness, and behavior. Melatonin (3 mg/day) was used for 14 days. All the measurements were made three times: before the treatment period, during the treatment (days 12-14), and 3 weeks after the discontinuation of the treatment. The sleep patterns of all the children improved, and half of them displayed excellent responses to melatonin. In particular, actigraphically measured sleep latency decreased from 40.02 +/- 24.09 minutes to 21.82 +/- 9.64 minutes (p = 0.002), whereas sleep duration remained steady at 477.40 +/- 55.56 minutes and 480.48 +/- 50.71 minutes. Despite the short duration of the treatment, behavioral measures also displayed a significant improvement, and most of the effect disappeared after the discontinuation of the melatonin (p = 0.001). In conclusion, melatonin may provide an interesting new and well-tolerated treatment option for children with Asperger disorder suffering from chronic insomnia. However, these results must be confirmed in a controlled study.
12785438		Prevalence of autistic spectrum disorder in children attending mainstream schools in a Welsh education authority.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2003	E Webb, J Morey, W Thompsen, C Butler, M Barber, W I Fraser		All mainstream primary schools in Cardiff were invited in July 1998 to participate in a prevalence survey of autistic spectrum disorder. Teachers of each class filled in a questionnaire based on ICD-10 criteria for autistic disorders. The Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) was completed on children identified with problems identified by the questionnaire. A total of 11692 children born between 1 September 1986 and 31 August 1990 were screened: 234 (2%) children were identified as requiring an ASSQ; 151 of 234 (65%) ASSQs were returned. Of the 151, 60 children (52 male, 8 female; 40%) scored 22 or more. Their notes and the involved professionals were consulted. Thirty-five children, unknown to specialist services or with complex features, required additional assessment. Seventeen children (all male) were found to be on the autistic spectrum. When the overall rubric was disentangled we found a diverse population of affected children including a handful who did not fit easily into ICD-10 classification. Correcting for incomplete ascertainment we found a minimum prevalence of 20.2 out of every 10 000 (SE = 4.5) for autistic spectrum disorder in this population.

12708584		Plasma amino acid levels in children with autism and their families.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Sarah Aldred, Kieran M Moore, Michael Fitzgerald, Rosemary H Waring		Plasma amino acid levels were measured in autistic and Asperger syndrome patients, their siblings, and parents. The results were compared with values from age-matched controls. Patients with autism or Asperger syndrome and their siblings and parents all had raised glutamic acid, phenylalanine, asparagine, tyrosine, alanine, and lysine (p < .05) than controls, with reduced plasma glutamine. Other amino acids were at normal levels. These results show that children with autistic spectrum disorders come from a family background of dysregulated amino acid metabolism and provide further evidence for an underlying biochemical basis for the condition.
12708582		Low-dose fluvoxamine treatment of children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders: a prospective, open-label study.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Andrés Martin, Kathleen Koenig, George M Anderson, Lawrence Scahill		The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose fluvoxamine (1.5 mg/kg/day) in youngsters with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). This was a prospective, open-label trial that included 18 subjects with a mean age of 11.3 +/- 3.6 years. Fourteen children (78%) completed the 10-week study. Premature discontinuation due to behavioral activation occurred in three participants. Although there was no response for the group as a whole, eight subjects (including all four females) were considered at least partial responders in intent-to-treat analyses. Neither pubertal status nor serotonin levels predicted clinical response. Fluvoxamine can be beneficial in the treatment of select children and adolescents with PDDs. Gender differences in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) response warrant further investigation.
12708578		The PDD Behavior Inventory: a rating scale for assessing response to intervention in children with pervasive developmental disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Ira L Cohen, Susan Schmidt-Lackner, Raymond Romanczyk, Vicki Sudhalter		The PDD Behavior Inventory (PDDBI) is a rating scale filled out by caregivers or teachers that was designed to assess children having a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD; autism, Asperger disorder, PDD-NOS, or childhood disintegrative disorder). Both adaptive and maladaptive behaviors are assessed in the scale, making it useful for treatment studies in which decreases in maladaptive behaviors and improvements in adaptive social and language skills relevant to PDD are expected. The adaptive behaviors assessed include core features of the disorder such as joint attention skills, pretend play, and referential gesture. The maladaptive behaviors sample a wide variety of behaviors observed in both lower- and higher-functioning individuals and include stereotyped behaviors, fears, aggression, social interaction deficits, and aberrant language. The inventory was found to have a high degree of internal consistency. Inter-rater reliability was better for adaptive behaviors than for maladaptive behaviors. Factor analyses confirmed the structure of the PDDBI and indicated good construct validity. In a subsample of children between 3 and 6 years of age, raw scores for adaptive behaviors increased with age in the parent and teacher versions, as did measures of social pragmatic problems. It was concluded that the PDDBI is both reliable and valid and is useful in providing information not typically available in most instruments used to assess children with PDD.
12708576		Stability and change among high-functioning children with pervasive developmental disorders: a 2-year outcome study.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Elizabeth Starr, Peter Szatmari, Susan Bryson, Lonnie Zwaigenbaum		This study prospectively compared the 2-year outcome of children diagnosed with autism or Asperger syndrome at age 6-8 years in terms of symptoms from the Autism Diagnostic Interview. Significant differences were seen in the three-domain summary scores of social interaction, communication, and repetitive activities, with the Asperger syndrome group demonstrating fewer and/or less severe symptoms at both times. There was a trend for the trajectories to come together over time on the socialization and communication domains, but not the repetitive activities domain. Differences were not attributable to IQ. Analysis of individual items indicated that the autism group improved over time on seven items and showed increased symptom severity on three items. On the other hand, the Asperger syndrome group improved on only two items and showed increased symptom severity on six items. Results suggest that the two PDD subtypes represent similar developmental trajectories, although the Asperger syndrome group maintains its advantage. Educational and clinical implications of the results are discussed.
12708575		Outcome in high-functioning adults with autism with and without early language delays: implications for the differentiation between autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2003	Patricia Howlin	Department of Psychology, St. George's Hospital Medical School, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 ORE, UK. phowlin@sghms.ac.uk	The question of whether Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism should be considered as the same or different conditions has been a source of debate and controversy over recent years. In the present study, 34 adults with autism who had shown early delays in language were compared with 42 individuals who were reported to have had no such delays, either in their use of words or phrases. All participants were at least 18 years of age, had a nonverbal IQ of 70 or above and met ADI-R criteria for age of onset, communication and social impairments, and stereotyped behaviors. Those in the language delay group were diagnosed as having high-functioning autism. The remainder were designated as having Asperger syndrome. The groups were matched for age, nonverbal IQ and gender. No significant differences were found between the groups either in their total ADI-R algorithm scores, or in their algorithm scores on individual domains. Social outcome ratings and ADI-R scores based on current functioning also failed to differentiate between the groups. Scores on tests of language comprehension and expression were also similar, but in both groups language abilities were well below chronological age level. The implications of these results with respect to the differences between Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism are discussed. The poor performance on language tests also challenges the assumption that early language development in Asperger syndrome is essentially normal.
12692455		Use of citalopram in pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2003	Lisa B Namerow, Prakash Thomas, Jeff Q Bostic, Jefferson Prince, Michael C Monuteaux		This study assessed the effectiveness and tolerability of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram in the treatment of patients with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). The medical charts of 15 children and adolescents (aged 6-16 yr) with Asperger syndrome, autism, or PDD not otherwise specified treated with citalopram were retrospectively reviewed. The final dose of citalopram was 16.9 +/- 12.1 mg/day with a treatment duration of 218.8 +/- 167.2 days. Independent ratings of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Severity and Improvement scales allowed comparison between baseline and PDD symptoms at the last visit. Eleven adolescents (73%) exhibited significant improvement in PDD, anxiety, or mood CGI score (z = 2.95; p =.003). Anxiety symptoms associated with PDDs improved significantly in 66% of patients (z = 2.83, p =.005), and mood symptoms improved significantly in 47% of patients (z = 2.78, p =.005). Mild side effects were reported by five patients (33%). These data suggest citalopram may be effective, safe, and well tolerated as part of the treatment of PDDs.

12639334		Towards an understanding of the mechanisms of weak central coherence effects: experiments in visual configural learning and auditory perception.	Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences	2003	Kate Plaisted, Lisa Saksida, José Alcántara, Emma Weisblatt		The weak central coherence hypothesis of Frith is one of the most prominent theories concerning the abnormal performance of individuals with autism on tasks that involve local and global processing. Individuals with autism often outperform matched nonautistic individuals on tasks in which success depends upon processing of local features, and underperform on tasks that require global processing. We review those studies that have been unable to identify the locus of the mechanisms that may be responsible for weak central coherence effects and those that show that local processing is enhanced in autism but not at the expense of global processing. In the light of these studies, we propose that the mechanisms which can give rise to 'weak central coherence' effects may be perceptual. More specifically, we propose that perception operates to enhance the representation of individual perceptual features but that this does not impact adversely on representations that involve integration of features. This proposal was supported in the two experiments we report on configural and feature discrimination learning in high-functioning children with autism. We also examined processes of perception directly, in an auditory filtering task which measured the width of auditory filters in individuals with autism and found that the width of auditory filters in autism were abnormally broad. We consider the implications of these findings for perceptual theories of the mechanisms underpinning weak central coherence effects.
12639333		The systemizing quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism, and normal sex differences.	Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences	2003	Simon Baron-Cohen, Jennifer Richler, Dheraj Bisarya, Nhishanth Gurunathan, Sally Wheelwright		Systemizing is the drive to analyse systems or construct systems. A recent model of psychological sex differences suggests that this is a major dimension in which the sexes differ, with males being more drawn to systemize than females. Currently, there are no self-report measures to assess this important dimension. A second major dimension of sex differences is empathizing (the drive to identify mental states and respond to these with an appropriate emotion). Previous studies find females score higher on empathy measures. We report a new self-report questionnaire, the Systemizing Quotient (SQ), for use with adults of normal intelligence. It contains 40 systemizing items and 20 control items. On each systemizing item, a person can score 2, 1 or 0, so the SQ has a maximum score of 80 and a minimum of zero. In Study 1, we measured the SQ of n = 278 adults (114 males, 164 females) from a general population, to test for predicted sex differences (male superiority) in systemizing. All subjects were also given the Empathy Quotient (EQ) to test if previous reports of female superiority would be replicated. In Study 2 we employed the SQ and the EQ with n = 47 adults (33 males, 14 females) with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), who are predicted to be either normal or superior at systemizing, but impaired at empathizing. Their scores were compared with n = 47 matched adults from the general population in Study 1. In Study 1, as predicted, normal adult males scored significantly higher than females on the SQ and significantly lower on the EQ. In Study 2, again as predicted, adults with AS/HFA scored significantly higher on the SQ than matched controls, and significantly lower on the EQ than matched controls. The SQ reveals both a sex difference in systemizing in the general population and an unusually strong drive to systemize in AS/HFA. These results are discussed in relation to two linked theories: the 'empathizing-systemizing' (E-S) theory of sex differences and the extreme male brain (EMB) theory of autism.
12639327		A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna.	Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological sciences	2003	Kathrin Hippler, Christian Klicpera		To date, it is questionable whether the diagnostic criteria for Asperger syndrome (AS) as stated by ICD-10 or DSM-IV still reflect Asperger's original account of 'autistic psychopathy' (AP) from the 1940s. The present study examined 74 clinical case records of children with AP diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the Viennese Children's Clinic and Asperger's private practice between 1950 and 1986. The characteristic features of the children are outlined, including reasons for referral, parental background, behavioural problems, cognitive functioning, communication and interests. Results show that the patients of Asperger described in our study represent a subgroup of children with very high intellectual functioning, specific circumscribed interests and talents but impaired social, communication and motor skills. Sixty-eight percent of the sample met ICD-10 criteria for AS, while 25% fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for autism. Implications for the diagnosis of AS are discussed.
12638767		Psychosocial functioning in a group of Swedish adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2003	I Engström, L Ekström, B Emilsson		This study reports on psychosocial functioning in Swedish adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA). A systematically selected sample of patients and relatives was interviewed concerning their psychosocial situation. The majority was living independently. All persons but one were unemployed. None was married and none had children. Only a few had some kind of partner. Most persons needed a high level of public and/or private support. The overall adjustment was rated good in 12 percent, fair in 75 percent and poor in 12 percent. Adult persons with AS/HFA have extensive need for support from their families and/or society. This information is important in order to provide adequate interventions that are in accordance with the expressed needs of the individuals themselves.
12638763		The disclosure of a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder: determinants of satisfaction in a sample of Scottish parents.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2003	Clare A Brogan, Christina Knussen		Satisfaction with disclosure of the diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder was investigated using a self-report questionnaire completed by 126 parents. On a rating of satisfaction, 55 percent indicated that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the disclosure. Parents were more likely to be satisfied if they gave positive ratings to the manner of the professional and the quality of the information provided; if they had been given written information and the opportunity to ask questions; and if their early suspicions had been accepted by professionals. These factors were combined into a global index of satisfaction; those gaining higher scores were more likely to have been given the diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (as opposed to autism), to have had a definite diagnosis, and to have children who were not currently in an educational placement. These results underline the importance of the interaction between parent and professional during the disclosure interview.
12634868		A candidate region for Asperger syndrome defined by two 17p breakpoints.	European journal of human genetics : EJHG	2003	Dmitry Tentler, Tonnie Johannesson, Maria Johansson, Maria Råstam, Christopher Gillberg, Christina Orsmark, Birgit Carlsson, Jan Wahlström, Niklas Dahl		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a mild form of autistic disorder characterised by impairment in social interaction as well as a restricted pattern of behaviour, interests, and activities. Two patients with AS and balanced translocations t(13;17) and t(17;19), respectively, were identified. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis with chromosome 17 specific clones to metaphase chromosomes from both patients showed that the chromosome 17 breakpoints are located within a 300 kb region at 17p13. The region spans 14 known genes. The expression of these genes was analysed in lymphoblastoid RNA derived from the patients and healthy control individuals. The CHRNE, DKFZP566H073, LOC90048, PFN1, SPAG7, KIAA0909, ZNF232 and KIF1C genes showed similar levels of expression in cell lines with the translocations when compared with cell lines with normal karyotype. No expression was detected for the MINK, GP1BA, SLC25A11, ENO3, FLJ10060 and USP6 genes in any of the cell lines. The close physical relation of the two 17p breakpoints suggest a common genetic aetiology for the phenotype in the patients. Structural and functional analysis of the genes located around the two 17p breakpoints in t(13;17) and t(17;19) patients may reveal candidate sequences for the AS phenotype.
12613779		Comorbid Asperger and Tourette syndromes with localized mesencephalic, infrathalamic, thalamic, and striatal damage.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2003	Marcelo L Berthier, Jaime Kulisevsky, Beatriz Asenjo, Jesús Aparicio, Diego Lara		We describe the coexistence of Asperger and Tourette syndromes (AS and TS) caused by discrete hypoxic-ischaemic necrosis of the midbrain, infrathalamic and thalamic nuclei, and striatum in an adolescent male with positive family history for tics and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Behavioural ratings, cognitive tests, and volumetric measurements of the basal ganglia were performed in the patient and five other individuals with AS-TS unassociated with MRI lesions. Cognitive deficits in attentional, executive, and visual-spatial domains were found both in the patient and control AS-TS group, though deficits were more severe in the former. MRI showed reduction of the left basal ganglia volume compared with the right in the patient, whereas the control group showed reduction of right basal ganglia volume compared with the left. It is suggested that individuals with a genetic predisposition to TS may develop AS and TS after involvement of midbrain and related components of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits normally implicated in the integration of emotional, cognitive, and motor functions.

30440230	doi: 10.1017/S0790966700007503	Did Alan Turing have Asperger's syndrome?	Irish journal of psychological medicine	2003	Henry O'Connell, Michael Fitzgerald	Ballyfermot Child Guidance Clinic,Ballyfermot Road,Ballyfermot,Dublin 10,Ireland. Mercer's Institute for Research on Ageing,St. James's Hospital,Dublin 8,Ireland.	Alan Turing was born in Paddington, London on June 23, 1912 . His family were middle-class and well-off. He was fascinated with science from an early age and showed precocious talent, especially in the areas of chemistry and mathematics. He attended Sherbourne Public School and then King's College, Cambridge where he studied mathematics. His areas of interest at Cambridge were probability theory and mathematical logic. It was at Cambridge that he first conceptualised the Universal Turing Machine, an idea that was to evolve into the modern theory of computing. He has been referred to as the father of the computer. He worked on a cipher machine at Princeton University between 1936 and 1938. He worked for the British Government during World War II with the Government Code and Cipher School at Bletchley Park. He was ultimately the key player in deciphering the German 'Enigma' code used by its submarines during the war. After the war he took up a post in Manchester University where he continued to work on ideas of artificial intelligence. He was arrested and charged for homosexual activity in 1952 and underwent a course of oestrogen therapy. He committed suicide in 1954. He was regarded as being socially aloof and eccentric by colleagues and friends. He was interested in mathematics, chemistry and logic from an early age, to the exclusion of other activities. This paper attempts to establish whether he fulfilled the criteria for Asperger's syndrome.

12593801		Impaired mirror-image imitation in Asperger and high-functioning autistic subjects.	Current biology : CB	2003	Sari Avikainen, Andreas Wohlschläger, Sasu Liuhanen, Ritva Hänninen, Riitta Hari		Imitation is crucial for proper development of social and communicative skills. Here, we argue that, based on an error analysis of a behavioral imitation task, adult Asperger and high-functioning autistic subjects suffer from an intriguing deficit of imitation: they lack the natural preference for imitation in a mirror-image fashion. The imitation task consisted of a simple movement sequence of putting a pen with the left or right hand into a green or a blue cup using one of two possible grips. The subjects were asked to imitate the experimenter's hand movements either using the crossed hand (e.g., the subject's right hand corresponding to the experimenter's right hand) for imitation or to imitate as if looking in a mirror (e.g., the subject's left hand corresponding to the experimenter's right hand). When people normally view other persons face-to-face, they prefer to imitate as in a mirror, and observation of mirror-image-like movements speeds up performance in nonimitative tasks. However, our autistic subjects, defective in social cognition, did not profit from mirror-image movements of others. These results provide a new insight into the difficulties that autistic subjects face in viewing and understanding actions of others.
12593341		Differences in stress and coping for mothers and fathers of children with Asperger's syndrome and nonverbal learning disorders.	Pediatric nursing	2002	Liza Little	Department of Nursing, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA.	Research conducted on families of children with disabilities shows that family cohesion and positive family outcomes are influenced by how mothers and fathers cope with raising their child with disabilities. This study was designed to examine stress and coping differences between mothers and fathers (n = 103) of children with Asperger's syndrome (AS) and nonverbal learning disorders (NLD). A repeated measure design was used to compare how mothers and fathers cope with caring for a particular child to control for differences in the severity and nature of the disability across children. Few studies that compare mothers and fathers do so at the couple level. Responses indicated that mothers had higher rates of stress related to family problems and pessimism about their child's future, higher rates of antidepressant use, and higher rates of therapy use than did fathers. Mothers found some coping strategies more helpful than fathers did. Maternal education and child's age also were related to some stress and coping variables. Implications for nurses and future research are discussed.

International journal of circumpolar health	2002	Sigita Lesinskiene	Center of Child Psychiatry and Social Paediatrics, Vilnius University, Lithuania. Sigita.Lesinskiene@vrc.vu.lt	Free drawings of children with AS, aged 7-16 years, were analysed in relation to the clinical picture comprising their difficulties in communication, social behaviour and cognition. All children showed good abilities in drawing. Pictures had some common traits and were distinctly original, reflecting peculiarities of the syndrome features. Analysis of free drawings was found to be a helpful tool in understanding the inner world and the dynamic changes during the therapy process of these children.
12585823		Asperger syndrome with comorbid emotional disorder--treatment with psychoanalytic psychotherapy.	International journal of circumpolar health	2002	Mervi-Marja Mero	Clinic of Child Psychiatry, University Hospital of Oulu, Oulu, Finland. mervi-marja.mero@pp.inet.fi	The purpose of psychoanalytic psychotherapy is to help the child to grow and develop normally. Children who are able to play, process their problems in the play. The therapist's role is to engage with the play and verbalize the emotions and the interactions demonstrated in it. This case-presentation illustrates how the child can express and work his inner fears and anxieties in play-situations with the therapist and shows how this interaction helps the child to develop and individuate. Children diagnosed as having Asperger syndrome may have emotional problems, in which case psychoanalytical psychotherapy is one of the means of helping the child and the family.
12585821		The development and evaluation of a computer-based program to test and to teach the recognition of facial affect.	International journal of circumpolar health	2002	Sven Bölte, Sabine Feineis-Matthews, Simone Leber, Thomas Dierks, Daniela Hubl, Fritz Poustka		"Autism is a chronic pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the early onset of social and communicative impairments as well as restricted, ritualized, stereotypic behavior. The endophenotype of autism includes neuropsychological deficits, for instance a lack of ""Theory of Mind"" and problems recognizing facial affect. In this study, we report the development and evaluation of a computer-based program to teach and test the ability to identify basic facially expressed emotions. 10 adolescent or adult subjects with high-functioning autism or Asperger-syndrome were included in the investigation. A priori the facial affect recognition test had shown good psychometric properties in a normative sample (internal consistency: rtt=.91-.95; retest reliability: rtt=.89-.92). In a prepost design, one half of the sample was randomly assigned to receive computer treatment while the other half of the sample served as control group. The training was conducted for five weeks, consisting of two hours training a week. The trained individuals improved significantly on the affect recognition task, but not on any other measure. Results support the usefulness of the program to teach the detection of facial affect. However, the improvement found is limited to a circumscribed area of social-communicative function and generalization is not ensured."

12581830		Deficient auditory processing in children with Asperger Syndrome, as indexed by event-related potentials.	Neuroscience letters	2003	Eira Jansson-Verkasalo, Rita Ceponiene, Marko Kielinen, Kalervo Suominen, Ville Jäntti, Sirkka Liisa Linna, Irma Moilanen, Risto Näätänen		Asperger Syndrome (AS) is characterized by normal language development but deficient understanding and use of the intonation and prosody of speech. While individuals with AS report difficulties in auditory perception, there are no studies addressing auditory processing at the sensory level. In this study, event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded for syllables and tones in children with AS and in their control counterparts. Children with AS displayed abnormalities in transient sound-feature encoding, as indexed by the obligatory ERPs, and in sound discrimination, as indexed by the mismatch negativity. These deficits were more severe for the tone stimuli than for the syllables. These results indicate that auditory sensory processing is deficient in children with AS, and that these deficits might be implicated in the perceptual problems encountered by children with AS.
12570979		Gender and coping: the parents of children with high functioning autism.	Social science & medicine (1982)	2003	David E Gray	Discipline of Sociology, School of Social Science, University of New England, NSW 2351, Armidale, Australia. dgray@metz.une.edu.au	Gender is a concept that is frequently discussed in the literature on stress, coping and illness. Research has reported that women are more vulnerable than men are to stressful events and use different strategies to cope with them. Furthermore, it is often asserted that these gender-based differences in coping may partially explain the differential impact of stressful events on men and women. Unfortunately, much of this research has equated gender with sex and failed to contextualise the experience of illness and coping. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the role of gender and coping among parents of children with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome in an Australian sample. It attempts to analyse the different meanings of the disability for mothers and fathers and describes the various strategies that parents use to cope with their child's disability.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	Sam Goldstein	Neurology, Learning, and Behavior Center, Salt Lake City, Utah 84102-2015, USA. info@samgoldstein.com	The Asperger's Syndrome Diagnostic Scale (2001) was reviewed to determine it's reliability, validity, and clinical utility in the diagnostic process for pervasive developmental disorder, specifically Asperger's syndrome. Concerns were raised about validity of the instrument, population upon which the instrument was normed, capability of the instrument to provide accurate differential diagnoses, and properties of the scale. The measure was determined to hold promise as a research tool, but there appears to be little evidence that it can distinguish among the various types of pervasive developmental disorder or diagnosis Asperger syndrome specifically.
12549756		Prosopagnosia in a preschool child with Asperger syndrome.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2003	Joachim Pietz, Friedrich Ebinger, Dietz Rating		We investigated a male, aged 4 years 11 months, who fulfilled the criteria of Asperger syndrome). In addition to the typical pattern of autistic symptoms, psychological testing revealed prosopagnosia in tasks for face recognition and matching. Prosopagnosia was also present when he tried to identify the faces of his parents and himself in photographs whenever these were presented with photographs of other persons. Although impairment in reciprocal social interaction in individuals with Asperger syndrome is closely correlated to their impaired perceptional abilities in non-verbal communication, especially facial expression, overt prosopagnosia seems to be a rare neuropsychological symptom in persons with autistic disorders.

12519463		Childhood autism rating scale--Tokyo version for screening pervasive developmental disorders.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	2003	Hisateru Tachimori, Hirokazu Osada, Hiroshi Kurita		To assess the utility of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale - Tokyo Version (CARS-TV), its total score was compared among 430 children with DSM-IV per subgroup (i.e. autistic disorder (AD), childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), Asperger's disorder, and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) not otherwise specified (PDDNOS)). Values of Cronbach's alpha were 0.91 for the PDD group and 0.89 for the non-PDD mental retardation (MR) group, and 0.93 for both groups combined. The total score was significantly higher in PDD (mean = 30.1, SD = 4.5) than in non-PDD MR (mean = 22.9, SD = 3.3), t(503) = 13.7, P< 0.0001. The cut-off to distinguish PDD from non-PDD MR was 25.5/26, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 0.86, 0.83, 0.97 and 0.50, respectively. The total score differed significantly among the four groups, with CDD and AD being significantly higher than both PDDNOS and Asperger's disorder, PDDNOS being significantly higher than Asperger's disorder and no significant difference between CDD and AD. The cut-off to distinguish AD from PDDNOS was 30/30.5, with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 0.71, 0.75, 0.77 and 0.69, respectively. CARS-TV seems to be a useful instrument for differentiating between PDD and non-PDD MR and between AD and PDDNOS, although further replication is needed.

The reasons for this lack of awareness lie in the history of the disorder and in the historical development of mental health services. Because, as Santayana wrote, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,"" this article reprises some of the history given elsewhere in this issue, but in a highly partial way, to bring out what the author believes to be the historically grounded prejudices that are the first challenge to anyone wanting to help adolescents and adults with Asperger syndrome."
12512402		Behavioral forms of stress management for individuals with Asperger syndrome.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Brenda Smith Myles	Department of Special Education, University of Kansas, Joseph R. Pearson Hall, 1122 West Campus Road, 5th Floor, Lawrence, KS 66045-3101, USA. bmyles@ku.edu	Although many children and youth with AS exhibit anxiety that may lead to challenging behaviors, stress and subsequent behaviors should be viewed as an integral part of the disorder [36]. As such, it is important to understand the cycle of behaviors to prevent seemingly minor events from escalating. Although understanding the cycle of tantrums, rage, and meltdowns is important, behavior changes will not occur unless the function of the behavior is understood and the student is provided instruction and support in using (1) strategies that increase social understanding and problem solving, (2) techniques that facilitate self-understanding, and (3) methods of self-calming. Because little research exists on the cycle of behaviors exhibited by students with AS and interventions appropriate at each stage, a systematic program of research is required to identify which techniques are most appropriate for children and youth, the context in which they can be used, and methods to ensure that individuals with AS generalize these skills to home, school, and community.
12512401		Social skills interventions for the autism spectrum: essential ingredients and a model curriculum.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Lori Krasny, Brenda J Williams, Sherri Provencal, Sally Ozonoff		"This article outlines the ingredients the authors feel are critical to making social skills interventions successful for children with autism spectrum disorders. The authors described basic principles for teaching social skills that capitalize on the strengths of such children, while specifically addressing their deficits. The authors applied these widely used principles to group social skills intervention. In particular, social skills groups for children with ASD need to break down complex social behaviors into concrete steps and rules that can be memorized and practiced in a variety of settings. Abstract concepts must be made concrete through a variety of visual, tangible, ""hands-on"" activities that make socialization fun. Visual structure and predictable routines are essential. Also critical to the success of social skills intervention are instruction and activities that provide necessary support for the language abilities of the participants. A variety of learning opportunities must be used to teach the goals and skills most relevant to children with ASD. These skills must be integrated as intervention progresses. Furthermore, interactions that require the children to focus on peers create a positive social group culture. Within this culture and environment, self-awareness and positive self-esteem can be fostered. A behavior plan that specifies individual goals for group members and a specific system for delivering rewards should be included. Other important ingredients include generalization, which is encouraged through community outings, skill practice in more naturalistic settings, and collaboration with parents and teachers to work on skills outside the group intervention. Weekly therapy does little to change basic deficits of ASD unless there is daily practice and reinforcement of the skills being learned in more natural situations. The authors hope that outlining these principles and specific techniques will encourage more clinicians to offer social skills groups and thus increase their availability around the nation and world. Continued research and treatment for social skills is necessary to provide much needed empiric evidence to determine effectiveness of such interventions."

Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Rhea Paul	Department of Communication Disorders, Southern Connecticut State University, Yale Child Study Center, New Haven, CT, USA. rhea.paul@yale.edu	This article reviews a range of social communication interventions that have been developed for students with autism at the preschool, school age, and adolescent level. Adult-mediated and peer-mediated methods that use highly structured, child-centered, and hybrid methods are examined. Programs that provide information on generalization and maintenance are identified. A set of recommendations for programs that would seem to be most appropriate for students with Asperger syndrome is presented.

12512398		Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Katherine D Tsatsanis	Harvard Medical School, Yale Child Study Center, 149 Thirteenth Street, Floor 10, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA. ktsatsanis@partners.org	This article presents findings from the outcome literature on autism, Asperger syndrome (AS), and related disorders. The discussion of outcome principally focuses on life adaptation, but also considers outcome in AS in relationship to other diagnostic groups and across time. The current research in this area is neither substantial nor systematic. Thus, in this examination of the literature, the goal is to highlight salient findings, but also to put forward questions that might direct meaningful research in this area for the future and to consider implications for treatment.
12512397		Strategies for pharmacologic treatment of high functioning autism and Asperger syndrome.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Kenneth E Towbin	Departments of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and Pediatrics, George Washington University School of Medicine, Children's National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20010, USA. Kenneth.Towbin@nih.gov	The treatment of complex, polymorphous disorders like HFA/AS always brings a particular challenge to pharmacotherapy. Additionally, the specific characteristics presented by HFA/AS introduce unique complications to patient care and place unusual demands on a clinician's skill and experience. To provide safe and effective treatment, the clinician must understand the core features of the disorder and the manifestations of the condition in his or her patient. Furthermore, a thorough understanding of the family, school, and community resources and limitations is necessary. Once an assessment has been made, focusing on target symptoms provides a crucial framework for care. Knowing manifestations of symptoms and characterizing their distribution and behavior in that patient is most important. For patients with HFA/AS it is particularly essential to coordinate behavioral and pharmacologic objectives. The target symptoms should be tracked carefully and placed into a priority system that is based on the risks and disability they create for the patient. The skill of pharmacotherapy also means setting out realistic expectations, keeping track of the larger systems of care at school and home, and collaboration with parents and care providers. There is an expanding range and pace of biologic and intervention research into HFA/AS. The genetic work has produced exciting leads that are likely to be helpful to future generations [82-84], but the task of clinicians is to tend to today's patients. As we discover more about the complex neural circuitry subserving repetitive behaviors, reward systems, and social cognition, there are good reasons to believe our treatments will become more sophisticated and specific. Psychopharmacology is also moving to design medications that target more specific populations of receptor and brain functions. This is likely to produce medicines that have fewer side effects, are more effective, and are more symptom-specific. Pharmacotherapy is not the ultimate treatment for HFA/AS but it has a definite place. Medication can be a critical element in a comprehensive treatment plan. There is a wider range of medications with more specific biologic effects than ever before. For patients with HFA/AS these newer agents are safer and less disruptive. When paired with clinicians who are becoming more skilled at recognizing and managing symptoms, patients have a greater opportunity to reach their potential and lead pleasurable lives.
12512396		Epidemiologic data on Asperger disorder.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Eric Fombonne, Lee Tidmarsh		In 1944, Asperger described a syndrome that was subsequently given his name, although there is evidence from earlier European literature that clinical descriptions matching this disorder were available in the 1920s. Asperger's work was largely ignored until the seminal article by Wing, however, which led to a resurgence of interest in this diagnostic concept. Asperger disorder (AD) was only introduced as a separate diagnostic category in the latest revisions of ICD-10 and DSM-IV. Epidemiologic research on this disorder has only started in recent years and therefore data are still scarce on the prevalence of this syndrome. This article reviews available epidemiologic surveys that have shed light on the prevalence of AD.
12512395		Asperger syndrome: diagnosis and external validity.	Child and adolescent psychiatric clinics of North America	2003	Ami Klin, Fred R Volkmar		This article provides an overview of the history and clinical features of Asperger syndrome and considers guidelines for clinical assessment and treatment. A review of issues related to external validity is provided that points out the limitations of current research and lists several potentially beneficial areas of investigation into the nosologic status of the condition. It concludes with a discussion of the unequivocal need of individuals with severe social disabilities for comprehensive and adequate educational services and other treatments, regardless of the fact that the validity and usefulness of this specific diagnostic concept is far from resolved.

12496956		Oxytocin infusion reduces repetitive behaviors in adults with autistic and Asperger's disorders.	Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology	2003	Eric Hollander, Sherie Novotny, Margaret Hanratty, Rona Yaffe, Concetta M DeCaria, Bonnie R Aronowitz, Serge Mosovich		Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by dysfunction in three core behavioral domains: repetitive behaviors, social deficits, and language abnormalities. There is evidence that abnormalities exist in peptide systems, particularly the oxytocin system, in autism spectrum patients. Furthermore, oxytocin and the closely related peptide vasopressin are known to play a role in social and repetitive behaviors. This study examined the impact of oxytocin on repetitive behaviors in 15 adults with autism or Asperger's disorder via randomized double-blind oxytocin and placebo challenges. The primary outcome measure was an instrument rating six repetitive behaviors: need to know, repeating, ordering, need to tell/ask, self-injury, and touching. Patients with autism spectrum disorders showed a significant reduction in repetitive behaviors following oxytocin infusion in comparison to placebo infusion. Repetitive behavior in autism spectrum disorders may be related to abnormalities in the oxytocin system, and may be partially ameliorated by synthetic oxytocin infusion.
12462862		The autistic spectrum: subgroups, boundaries, and treatment.	The Psychiatric clinics of North America	2002	Sophie H N Willemsen-Swinkels, Jan K Buitelaar		"There is consensus about the disorders that comprise the autistic spectrum, with autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, and PDD-NOS as the most typical examples and Rett's disorder and disintegrative disorder as the other components. Important controversies regarding the precise definitions of autistic spectrum disorders and the boundaries between the milder manifestations of those disorders, particularly PDD-NOS, and non-autistic conditions have not been and cannot be resolved fully as long as there is no known biologic cause or consistent biologic or psychological marker. This includes issues as basic as whether the autistic spectrum is a predominantly unitary entity or a collection of more or less similar phenotypes with multiple, varying etiologies. This is why the highest long-term priority in the area of definite diagnosis is the search for biologic marker(s) for autism and related autism spectrum disorders [91]. In the absence of a medical test to unequivocally diagnose autism, definitions of autism and related conditions are based only on manifestations in overt behavior, with all the unreliability this entails. In the future, the discovery of biologic correlates, causes, and pathogenetic pathways will undoubtedly change the way in which autism is diagnosed and lead to a new nosology [95]. Until that time the definitions in the current versions of the classification systems should be considered in a state of evolution. The key problem of the current classification systems is the fact that the boundaries between the various disorders are fuzzy. Instead of a categorical approach, a more useful description might be that of ""autistic spectrum disorder,"" which reflects the range of severity of symptoms. Such a dimensional understanding of PDD is useful to clinicians, who may otherwise use nonspecific terms to avoid the categorical diagnosis of autism [31]. Rutter and Schopler [96] argued for separate clinical and research schemes because clinical and research needs are different. For research purposes it is desirable to have as much direct comparability across studies as possible. The focus is on a high degree of homogeneity within diagnostic groupings. A price must be paid for this detailed specification, and the main cost lies in the proportion of cases left undiagnosed. For example, there may be good scientific reasons for a narrowly defined categorical diagnosis that includes only individuals who definitely and clearly have a specifically defined condition and excludes individuals who may have the condition. For clinicians and educators, classification helps guide the selection of treatments for an individual. From this point of view, broader diagnostic concepts may be most appropriate [95]."
12462859		The social anxiety spectrum.	The Psychiatric clinics of North America	2002	Franklin R Schneier, Carlos Blanco, Smita X Antia, Michael R Liebowitz		Social anxiety disorder is well suited to the spectrum concept because it has trait-like qualities of early onset, chronicity, and no empirically derived threshold that demarcates normal from clinically significant trait social anxiety. Social anxiety disorder has been shown to respond to relatively specific pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral therapies, which makes identification of other conditions that may lie on the social anxiety disorder spectrum important because of possible treatment implications. Biologic markers associated with social anxiety disorder also may be shared by similar but nonidentical traits, such as behavioral inhibition and detachment. Clarification of the trait spectrums associated with specific biologic systems offers an opportunity for improving the understanding of the origin of these conditions. Strong evidence exists that at least some forms of shyness, avoidant personality disorder, and selective mutism lie on a social anxiety disorder spectrum. For several other disorders that share a prominent focus on social comparison, significant subgroups of patients seem to have features of social anxiety disorder. These disorders include major depression (especially the atypical subtype), body dysmorphic disorder, and eating disorders. Several other disorders marked by social dysfunction or inhibition, including substance use disorders (especially alcoholism), paranoid disorder, bipolar disorder, autism, and Asperger's disorder, also may show some overlap with social anxiety disorder features (e.g., social anxiety as a cause or complication of substance abuse, social avoidance in paranoid disorder, social disinhibiton in bipolar disorder, and social communication deficits in autism and Asperger's disorder). Social anxiety disorder also is associated with other anxiety disorders in general and other phobias in particular. In respect to traits, a growing body of evidence links behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar to a social anxiety disorder spectrum with some specificity. Biologic measures of dopamine system hypoactivity have been linked to social anxiety disorder, trait detachment, and general deficits in reward and incentive function. It remains to be clarified, however, whether this brain system function is best characterized by a social anxiety disorder spectrum or some variant that incorporates social reward deficits or social avoidance behavior. Social anxiety disorder, shyness, and behavioral inhibition all seem to have a genetic component, but more research is needed to attempt to identify a more specifically heritable temperament associated with these conditions. Finally, the emergent concept of a social anxiety spectrum needs maturation. Although the notion of a single social anxiety disorder spectrum currently has some clinical use, the authors believe that exclusive focus on the notion of a single continuum with two extremes--from social disinhibition in mania to the most severe form of social anxiety, avoidant personality disorder--is premature and limiting in respect to etiologic research. An alternative approach is to conceptualize multiple, probably overlapping spectra in this area of social psychopathology. Individual dimensions might be based on various core phenomenologic, cognitive, or biologic characteristics. A bottom-up biologic approach holds promise for identifying spectra with a common etiology that might respond to specific treatments. Taking a pluralistic view of the concept of spectrum at this stage may help accelerate our understanding of social anxiety and related disorders.
12455663		The case of Jeffrey Dahmer: sexual serial homicide from a neuropsychiatric developmental perspective.	Journal of forensic sciences	2002	J Arturo Silva, Michelle M Ferrari, Gregory B Leong		Sexual serial homicidal behavior has received considerable attention during the last three decades. Substantial progress has been made in the development of methods aimed at identifying and apprehending individuals who exhibit these behaviors. In spite of these advances, the origins of sexual serial killing behavior remain for the most part unknown. In this article we propose a biopsychosocial psychiatric model for understanding the origins of sexual serial homicidal behavior from both neuropsychiatric and developmental perspectives, using the case of convicted serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer as the focal point. We propose that his homicidal behavior was intrinsically associated with autistic spectrum psychopathology, specifically Asperger's disorder. The relationship of Asperger's disorder to other psychopathology and to his homicidal behavior is explored. We discuss potential implications of the proposed model for the future study of the causes of sexual serial homicidal crime.
12441598		The stress of the university experience for students with Asperger syndrome.	Work (Reading, Mass.)	2001	Tara J. Glennon	Department of Occupational Therapy, Quinnipiac University, Mt. Carmel Avenue, Hamden, CT 06518, USA and Pediatric Occupational Therapy Services, Inc., 1300 Post Road, Suite 204, Fairfield, CT 06430, USA.	College students, with or without disabilities, are faced with numerous stressful situations within the university environment. For an individual diagnosed with Asperger syndrome, success at this level requires non-traditional supports. With limited knowledge of this disorder, the university staff are faced with a distinct disadvantage in their efforts to outline an appropriate plan. While providing traditional academic assistance is now commonplace, federal laws mandate that universities widen the scope of support so as not to exclude any student from campus activities or programs. In an effort to provide a framework for support, this article interfaces diagnostic information with the realities of college life. Areas of focus include the transition process, social rules, engagement in academic activities, and mastering a new life of independence. It is hoped that the presented suggestions might prove helpful as universities begin to establish service support teams and outline plans of support.

12432978		Seizures and extrapyramidal symptoms in a patient with Tourette's syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis treated with interferon beta-1a and clomipramine.	Pharmacotherapy	2002	Beth M Dubisar, Steven C Stoner, Rintu Khan, Cynthia D Farrar		Seizure activity is a known complication associated with multiple sclerosis; however, it may also result from side effects of the treatments for the disease. A 21-year-old man with Tourette's syndrome, pedophilia, Asperger's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis experienced seizures after receiving therapy with interferon beta-1a. Adjustments in his drug regimen led to the discovery of pseudoparkinsonism and other extrapyramidal symptoms. This case report illustrates how pharmacodynamic properties of drugs can complicate the treatment of neurologic disorders. Clinicians must be aware of the delicate balance between the signs and symptoms of disease states and the effects of drugs.
12427298		A retrospective assessment of citalopram in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2002	Jennifer L Couturier, Rob Nicolson		Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used to treat symptoms of aggression and anxiety in children and adolescents with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs), there are no published reports of the use of citalopram in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine the benefits and adverse effects of citalopram in a group of children and adolescents with PDDs. Target behaviors included aggression, anxiety, stereotypies, and preoccupations. Seventeen patients with PDDs (14 with autistic disorder, three with Asperger's disorder) (mean age = 9.4 +/- 2.9 years; range 4-15 years) were treated with citalopram for at least 2 months (mean duration of treatment = 7.4 +/- 5.3 months; range 1-15 months). Treatment was initiated at a low dose (5 mg daily) and was increased by 5 mg weekly as tolerated and as necessary. The mean final dose was 19.7 +/- 7.8 mg (range 5-40 mg). Outcome was based on a consensus between clinician and parents, using the Improvement item of the Clinical Global Impressions Scale as a guide. Ten (59%) children were judged to be much improved or very much improved regarding target behaviors. Core symptoms of PDDs (social interactions, communication) did not show clinically significant improvement. Citalopram was generally well tolerated, although four patients developed treatment-limiting adverse effects: two with increased agitation, one with insomnia, and one with possible tics. The results of this case series suggest that citalopram has beneficial effects on some interfering behaviors associated with PDDs with few adverse effects. Controlled trials are warranted.
12422404		[Three criminal cases with Asperger's disorder: how their handicap was reflected in their antisocial behaviors].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2002	Motomi Toichi, Morimitsu Sakihama		Three patients with Asperger's disorder who were sent to Juvenile Court for sexual offenses are presented, and the relationship between this disorder and their crimes is discussed. All three adolescents showed unusual behaviors related to their crimes. The analysis of these cases suggested: 1) the idiosyncrasies seen in the crimes were closely related to their social deficits and obsessive traits, which are the two major problems in pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), 2) their offensive behaviors were not the direct results of their deficits due to PDD, and 3) their criminal behaviors should be understood in the unique context that is specific to PDD, not from conventional psychological viewpoints. Finally, current problems associated with PDD in Japan are discussed.

12297988		On the twin risk in autism.	American journal of human genetics	2002	Joachim Hallmayer, Emma J Glasson, Carol Bower, Beverly Petterson, Lisa Croen, Judith Grether, Neil Risch		Autism is considered by many to be the most strongly genetically influenced multifactorial childhood psychiatric disorder. In the absence of any known gene or genes, the main support for this is derived from family and twin studies. Two recent studies (Greenberg et al. 2001; Betancur et al. 2002) suggested that the twinning process itself is an important risk factor in the development of autism. If true, this would have major consequences for the interpretation of twin studies. Both studies compared the number of affected twin pairs among affected sib pairs to expected values in two separate samples of multiplex families and reported a substantial and significant excess of twin pairs. Using data from our epidemiological study in Western Australia, we investigated the possibility of an increased rate of autism in twins. All children born between 1980 and 1995 with autism, Asperger syndrome, or pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) were ascertained. Of the 465 children with a diagnosis, 14 were twin births (rate 30.0/1,000) compared to 9,640 children of multiple births out of a total of 386,637 births in Western Australia between 1980 and 1995 (twin rate weighted to number of children with autism or PDD per year 26.3/1,000). These data clearly do not support twinning as a substantial risk factor in the etiology of autism. We demonstrate that the high proportion of twins found in affected-sib-pair studies can be adequately explained by the high ratio of concordance rates in monozygotic (MZ) twins versus siblings and the distribution of family size in the population studied. Our results are in agreement with those of two similar studies by Croen et al. (2002) in California and Hultman et al. (2002) in Sweden.
12217224		Asperger's syndrome: implications for nursing practice.	Issues in mental health nursing	2002	Margaret Cole Marshall	University of Texas Health Science Center-San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA. PeggyMarshall@bigplanet.com	The most common disorders within the category of Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD) are the Autistic Disorders. In the 1994 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV, Asperger's Disorder became a distinct diagnosis within the Autistic category, as part of the disorders first diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. The terms Asperger's Disorder and Asperger's Syndrome are used interchangeably. Attention to and knowledge of Asperger's Syndrome (AS) are necessary to differentiate it from closely related disorders that have overlapping symptoms. There is much discussion about different definitions of Asperger's, different viewpoints of experts in the field, and the diagnostic dilemmas related thereto. Last, and most important, are the nursing implications. Nurses are in a position to identify children with Asperger's early. After identification, the necessary referrals, treatment options, support, and follow-up are essential for these children. Nurses need more knowledge about this disorder and need to be proactive in defining their role to help children with the disorder in the schools and the community.
12216059		The epidemiology of autistic spectrum disorders: is the prevalence rising?	Mental retardation and developmental disabilities research reviews	2002	Lorna Wing, David Potter		For decades after Kanner's original paper on the subject was published in 1943, autism was generally considered to be a rare condition with a prevalence of around 2-4 per 10,000 children. Then, studies carried out in the late 1990s and the present century reported annual rises in incidence of autism in pre-school children, based on age of diagnosis, and increases in the age-specific prevalence rates in children. Prevalence rates of up to 60 per 10,000 for autism and even more for the whole autistic spectrum were reported. Reasons for these increases are discussed. They include changes in diagnostic criteria, development of the concept of the wide autistic spectrum, different methods used in studies, growing awareness and knowledge among parents and professional workers and the development of specialist services, as well as the possibility of a true increase in numbers. Various environmental causes for a genuine rise in incidence have been suggested, including the triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR]. Not one of the possible environmental causes, including MMR, has been confirmed by independent scientific investigation, whereas there is strong evidence that complex genetic factors play a major role in etiology. The evidence suggests that the majority, if not all, of the reported rise in incidence and prevalence is due to changes in diagnostic criteria and increasing awareness and recognition of autistic spectrum disorders. Whether there is also a genuine rise in incidence remains an open question.
12212919		Temperament and character in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2002	Henrik Soderstrom, Maria Rastam, Christopher Gillberg		To study the personality characteristics of adults with Asperger syndrome, and investigate the value of self-rating personality inventories, we administered the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) to 31 outpatients with Asperger syndrome. The TCI is a self-rating personality inventory that has been validated in the Swedish general population. The results were compared with age- and sex-matched norm groups. Participants with Asperger syndrome scored significantly higher on harm avoidance and lower on self-directedness and cooperativeness. Reward dependence and novelty seeking tended to be low. They also had significantly higher rarity scores, reflecting idiosyncratic perspectives. The most common temperament configurations were 'obsessional', 'passive-dependent' and'explosive'. Character, reflecting conceptual maturity, was poorly developed in the majority of our subjects. The self-ratings of persons with Asperger syndrome thus indicated anxious personalities with coping difficulties in the areas of social interaction and self-directedness, a picture corresponding to the clinical descriptions of Asperger syndrome.
12212918		The effectiveness of parent management training to increase self-efficacy in parents of children with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2002	Kate Sofronoff, Michelle Farbotko		This study was a trial of an intervention programme aimed to improve parental self-efficacy in the management of problem behaviours associated with Asperger syndrome. The intervention was compared across two formats, a 1 day workshop and six individual sessions, and also with a non-intervention control group. The results indicated that, compared with the control group, parents in both intervention groups reported fewer problem behaviours and increased self-efficacy following the interventions, at both 4 weeks and 3 months follow-up. The results also showed a difference in self-efficacy between mothers and fathers, with mothers reporting a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy following intervention than fathers. There was no significant difference between the workshop format and the individual sessions.
12212915		Brief report: prevalence of autism spectrum conditions in children aged 5-11 years in Cambridgeshire, UK.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2002	Fiona J Scott, Simon Baron-Cohen, Patrick Bolton, Carol Brayne		The study aimed to establish prevalence of the broader autistic spectrum, including Asperger syndrome, in 5- to 11-year-olds in Cambridgeshire, UK. Cases of diagnosed autism spectrum condition (ASC) in children who were in Cambridgeshire schools and aged between 5 and 11 years on 31 December 1999 were sought using public records, screening instruments, educational psychology and special educational needs coordinator (SENCO) records. We report a prevalence of ASC in the age group 5-11 years of almost 0.6 percent (57 in 10,000). This is 11 times higher than the rate of classic autism but in line with other recent national and international rates for the broader spectrum. In the responding mainstream schools the prevalence was 0.33 percent. In the responding special school population it was 12.5 percent. The overall sex ratio of the children with ASC replicated findings for classical autism of 4:1 (M:F), but in those children being educated in mainstream schools the sex ratio was 8:1 (M:F).
12211417		Risperidone: a potential treatment for autism.	Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)	2002	David J Posey, Christopher J McDougle		Autistic disorder (autism) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by marked deficits in reciprocal social relatedness, communication impairment and a narrow range of interests and/or repetitive behaviors. Autism is frequently associated with, but distinct from, mental retardation. It is classified as a subtype of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) along with 'PDD not otherwise specified' (NOS) and Asperger's disorder. These disorders have in common marked impairments in social relatedness. Individuals with autism may also have other symptoms that become the primary focus of psychiatric treatment. These associated symptoms include aggression, self-injury, irritability and anxiety.
12210285		No evidence for linkage of liability to autism to HOXA1 in a sample from the CPEA network.	American journal of medical genetics	2002			A recent study by Ingram et al. [2000b: Teratology 62:393-405] suggests a (His)73(Arg) polymorphism (A:G) in HOXA1 contributes substantially to a liability for autism. Using 68 individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders, they found a significant dearth of G homozygotes and biased transmission of G alleles from parents to affected offspring, especially from mothers. Because the connection between HOXA1 and liability to autism is compelling, we attempted to replicate their finding using a larger, independent sample from the Collaborative Programs of Excellence in Autism (CPEA) network. In our data, genotype frequencies conform to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; allele transmissions meet Mendelian expectations; and there is no obvious sex-biased allele transmission. Based on our sample size, calculations suggest that we would have at least 95% power to detect linkage and association even if the A:G polymorphism were to account for only 1% of the heritability of autism. Therefore, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the samples in the two studies are intrinsically different, our data from our sample argue against a major role for HOXA1 (His)73(Arg) in liability to autism.
12208164		The ratio of 2nd to 4th digit length: a proxy for transactivation activity of the androgen receptor gene?	Medical hypotheses	2002	J T Manning, P E Bundred, B F Flanagan		The androgen receptor gene (AR) contains a domain which includes a variable number of CAG sequences and alleles with low numbers of CAG repeats show high transactivation activity when complexed with testosterone. The ratio of 2nd and 4th digit length (2D:4D) is negatively correlated with phenotypic effects of testosterone. Low numbers of CAG repeats and low 2D:4D are both associated with high sperm numbers and protection against breast cancer. This suggests that CAG number and 2D:4D are correlated i.e. low CAG number and low 2D:4D indicate high activation of androgen-responsive genes. Findings from AR studies predict that low 2D:4D will be associated with prostate and hepatocellular cancer, urolithiasis, ADHD, ankylosing spondylitis, spontaneous abortion, and polycystic ovaries, while high 2D:4D will be associated with motor neuron diseases and endometrial cancer. Findings from 2D:4D studies predict that short CAG length will be common in autism and Asperger's syndrome, while high numbers of CAG repeats will be found in men who are prone to early myocardial infarction.

12201069		Case history of co-morbid Asperger's syndrome and paraphilic behaviour.	Medicine, science, and the law	2002	John Milton, Conor Duggan, Andy Latham, Vincent Egan, Digby Tantam		We report a case of a man with Asperger's syndrome, paraphilic behaviour and convictions for sexual offences. We describe his assessment within a secure mental health setting to determine issues of diagnosis, treatment and risk. We also highlight the difficulty in reducing the risk of further offending because of the apparent ineffectiveness of interventions for the small group with Asperger's syndrome and an offending history. Consequently, they are likely to face long periods in institutional settings.

12199137		Lateralization in individuals with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder: a frontostriatal model.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	Nicole J Rinehart, John L Bradshaw, Avril V Brereton, Bruce J Tonge		Neurobiological and behavioural studies of possible left hemisphere dysfunction in autism have generated conflicting results. Left hemisphere dysfunction may manifest in autism only in tasks that invoke executive functions. Moreover, left hemisphere dysfunction may underpin autism but not Asperger's disorder. We thus aimed to systematically investigate reports of anomalous lateralization in individuals with high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder. Two of the tasks were sensitive to executive dysfunction: a serial choice reaction-time task and a Posner-type paradigm; the remaining tasks instead investigated aspects of perceptual lateralisation. Compared with age- and IQ-matched controls, the autism group displayed deficiencies in right hemispace (and by implication, left hemisphere) performance on both executive function tasks; however, this group demonstrated normal lateralization effects on the nonexecutive, visual-perceptual tasks. In contrast, the Asperger's disorder group showed similar laterality effects to their age- and IQ-matched controls on both executive and nonexecutive function tasks. The etiological relevance of this neurobehavioral dissociation between high-functioning autism and Asperger's disorder was discussed; in particular, it was suggested that the period where dominance shifts from right to left hemisphere is important in whatever process might dictate the emergence of either autism or Asperger's disorder.
12199132		Asperger syndrome: tests of right hemisphere functioning and interhemispheric communication.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	Helen L Gunter, Mohammad Ghaziuddin, Hadyn D Ellis		The primary aim of this investigation was to assess to what extent Rourke's (1989, 1995) nonverbal learning disabilities syndrome (NLD) model resembles the pattern of assets and deficits seen in people with Asperger syndrome (AS). NLD can be characterized by a cluster of deficits primarily affecting nonverbal aspects of functioning, in the presence of proficiency in single word reading and a superior verbal memory. The neurological underpinnings of this syndrome may be dysfunction of white matter affecting right hemisphere functioning and interhemispheric communication. To explore this hypothesis, eight participants with AS (ages 10 to 41 years) were assessed in the following areas: the pragmatics of language and communication, verbal and visual memory, visual-spatial abilities, and bimanual motor skills. Results confirmed the close similarity in the neuropsychologic profiles of NLD and AS.
12192642		A genomewide screen for autism-spectrum disorders: evidence for a major susceptibility locus on chromosome 3q25-27.	American journal of human genetics	2002	Mari Auranen, Raija Vanhala, Teppo Varilo, Kristin Ayers, Elli Kempas, Tero Ylisaukko-Oja, Janet S Sinsheimer, Leena Peltonen, Irma Järvelä		To identify genetic loci for autism-spectrum disorders, we have performed a two-stage genomewide scan in 38 Finnish families. The detailed clinical examination of all family members revealed infantile autism, but also Asperger syndrome (AS) and developmental dysphasia, in the same set of families. The most significant evidence for linkage was found on chromosome 3q25-27, with a maximum two-point LOD score of 4.31 (Z(max )(dom)) for D3S3037, using infantile autism and AS as an affection status. Six markers flanking over a 5-cM region on 3q gave Z(max dom) >3, and a maximum parametric multipoint LOD score (MLS) of 4.81 was obtained in the vicinity of D3S3715 and D3S3037. Association, linkage disequilibrium, and haplotype analyses provided some evidence for shared ancestor alleles on this chromosomal region among affected individuals, especially in the regional subisolate. Additional potential susceptibility loci with two-point LOD scores >2 were observed on chromosomes 1q21-22 and 7q. The region on 1q21-22 overlaps with the previously reported candidate region for infantile autism and schizophrenia, whereas the region on chromosome 7q provided evidence for linkage 58 cM distally from the previously described autism susceptibility locus (AUTS1).
12164013		Asperger's syndrome and aberrant neurofunctional organization--a case report.	The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences	2002	Huei-Lin Huang, Yu-Lien Shieh, Hsiu-Jung Wu, Sheng-Fa Chuang, Pinchen Yang, Yuh-Jyh Jong		Asperger's Syndrome(AS) is a severe developmental disorder characterized primarily by marked and sustained difficulties in social interaction and unusual patterns of circumscribed interests and behavioral peculiarities. AS differs from autism primarily in that there is no general delay or retardation in language. A 3. 5 year-old boy with AS was referred for psychological assessment and treatment. When the boy was 23 months old, he was assessed with Bayley Scales of Infant Development (2nd ed.). Both MDI and PDI were within normal limits. After the referral, this boy was assessed with WPPSI-R and then prescribed 5 weekly intervention sessions consisting of communication skills training. At a one week's follow-up the boy was reassessed with Leiter-R. The results of WPPSI-R and Leiter-R showed the boy was in the normal intelligence range. From the second session to the fifth session, the boy's mother recorded 526 of his utterances. According to the analysis of these speech data, the language development for this boy was at Stage V, which indicated that his language development was in the superior range for his age. After 5 intervention sessions, the improvements in the child's communication skills were such that no further sessions were warranted. This boy might represent a case of aberrant neurofunctional organization. He has defects in perceptual organization but has good pattern recognition, which is based on features. It is theorized that his excellent verbal ability competed with the perceptual organization, so that he compensated for perceptual organization with verbal ability. An intervention designed to inhibit verbal compensation and facilitate configural processing is recommended.
12150548		Trace determination of priority pesticides in water by means of high-speed on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry using turbulent-flow chromatography columns for enrichment and a short monolithic column for fast liquid chromatographic separation.	Journal of chromatography. A	2002	Arndt Asperger, Jürgen Efer, Therese Koal, Werner Engewald		An integrated on-line SPE-HPLC-MS/MS system has been developed for the rapid analysis of various trace level priority pesticides in surface and drinking water. Eleven pesticides were included in this study, with various phenylureas, triazines and organophosphorous species among them. Use of turbulent-flow chromatography columns (TFC, 50 x 1 mm, 30-50 microm particle size) as extraction cartridges enables fast on-line SPE at high sampling flow-rate (5 ml/min). Polymeric and carbon based TFC columns (Oasis HLB, Cyclone, Hypercarb) allow complete extraction with good recoveries from water volumes up to 50 ml. On-line coupling to HPLC is performed with re-mixing of the organic TFC eluate with water in front of the analytical column to ensure efficient band focussing. For fast HPLC analysis, a short monolithic column is applied in combination with highly selective API-MS/MS detection. Matrix effects on the APCI-MS/MS signal were found to be reduced by the system to an acceptable minimum. Limits of detection, determined for 10-ml samples of river water were in the range between 0.4 and 13 ng/l typically, except trifluralin (approximately 280 ng/l), which is less susceptible to ionization under atmospheric pressure conditions. At an enriched water volume of 10 ml, the whole SPE-HPLC-MS/MS procedure requires less than 14 min. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of drinking and surface water samples taken from several sampling sites around the city of Leipzig, Germany. Concentrations measured (maximum: 16 ng/l simazine in river water) were far below the concentration limits scheduled by law.
12135974		Autism, Asperger syndrome and brain mechanisms for the attribution of mental states to animated shapes.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2002	Fulvia Castelli, Chris Frith, Francesca Happé, Uta Frith		Ten able adults with autism or Asperger syndrome and 10 normal volunteers were PET scanned while watching animated sequences. The animations depicted two triangles moving about on a screen in three different conditions: moving randomly, moving in a goal-directed fashion (chasing, fighting), and moving interactively with implied intentions (coaxing, tricking). The last condition frequently elicited descriptions in terms of mental states that viewers attributed to the triangles (mentalizing). The autism group gave fewer and less accurate descriptions of these latter animations, but equally accurate descriptions of the other animations compared with controls. While viewing animations that elicited mentalizing, in contrast to randomly moving shapes, the normal group showed increased activation in a previously identified mentalizing network (medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal sulcus at the temporo-parietal junction and temporal poles). The autism group showed less activation than the normal group in all these regions. However, one additional region, extrastriate cortex, which was highly active when watching animations that elicited mentalizing, showed the same amount of increased activation in both groups. In the autism group this extrastriate region showed reduced functional connectivity with the superior temporal sulcus at the temporo-parietal junction, an area associated with the processing of biological motion as well as with mentalizing. This finding suggests a physiological cause for the mentalizing dysfunction in autism: a bottleneck in the interaction between higher order and lower order perceptual processes.
12125303		Psychotherapy of children with pervasive developmental disorders.	American journal of psychotherapy	2002	Louise Ruberman	Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx Children's Psychiatric Center, 1000 Waters Place, Bronx, N.Y. 10461, USA. rubuch01@aol.com	In recent years, the role of psychotherapy in the treatment of children with pervasive developmental disorders, such as autism and Asperger's Syndrome, has been questioned. Advances in neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and genetics, as well as the refinement of behavioral and educational techniques, have relegated discussions about psychotherapy mostly to reviews about the history of treatment for autism. Even when psychotherapeutic work is suggested, it is typically only very structured supportive counseling for older and high functioning children and adolescents that is considered. This paper argues that there is a central role for psychotherapy for children with pervasive developmental disorders, and that psychotherapeutic interventions should begin at a younger, rather than older age.
12123243		Atypical face gaze in autism.	Cyberpsychology & behavior : the impact of the Internet, multimedia and virtual reality on behavior and society	2002	Cheryl Trepagnier, Marc M Sebrechts, Rebecca Peterson		An eye-tracking study of face and object recognition was conducted to clarify the character of face gaze in autistic spectrum disorders. Experimental participants were a group of individuals diagnosed with Asperger's disorder or high-functioning autistic disorder according to their medical records and confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Controls were selected on the basis of age, gender, and educational level to be comparable to the experimental group. In order to maintain attentional focus, stereoscopic images were presented in a virtual reality (VR) headset in which the eye-tracking system was installed. Preliminary analyses show impairment in face recognition, in contrast with equivalent and even superior performance in object recognition among participants with autism-related diagnoses, relative to controls. Experimental participants displayed less fixation on the central face than did control-group participants. The findings, within the limitations of the small number of subjects and technical difficulties encountered in utilizing the helmet-mounted display, suggest an impairment in face processing on the part of the individuals in the experimental group. This is consistent with the hypothesis of disruption in the first months of life, a period that may be critical to typical social and cognitive development, and has important implications for selection of appropriate targets of intervention.
12120863		Conversational behaviour of children with Asperger syndrome and conduct disorder.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2002	Catherine Adams, Jonathan Green, Anne Gilchrist, Anthony Cox		Social communication problems in individuals who have Asperger syndrome constitute one of the most significant problems in the syndrome. This study makes a systematic analysis of the difficulties demonstrated with the use of language (pragmatics) in adolescents who have Asperger syndrome.
12120861		The severity and nature of motor impairment in Asperger's syndrome: a comparison with specific developmental disorder of motor function.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2002	Dido Green, Gillian Baird, Anna L Barnett, Leslie Henderson, Jörg Huber, Sheila E Henderson		The aims of this study were to measure objectively the extent and severity of motor impairment in children with Asperger's syndrome and to determine whether the motor difficulties experienced by such children differed in any way from those classified as having a Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function (SDD-MF). Criteria derived from ICD 10-R were used to identify 11 children with Asperger's syndrome and a matched group of 9 children with a Specific Developmental Disorder of Motor Function. Children in both groups were required to have a verbal IQ of 80 or greater on the WISC IIIR.
12119321		Empathy deficits in Asperger syndrome: a cognitive profile.	Neurocase	2002	S G Shamay-Tsoory, R Tomer, S Yaniv, J Aharon-Peretz		Although lack of empathy has been considered a central characteristic of Asperger syndrome, quantitative and qualitative assessments of empathy in this syndrome are lacking. We present two cases of adolescents with Asperger syndrome who show extreme deficits on measures of both cognitive and affective empathy. Analysis of their performance on tasks assessing cognitive and affective processing did not reveal significant impairment in executive functions, nor in their ability to recognize emotions or the ability to create a mental representation of another person's knowledge. However, both patients were unable to integrate the emotional content with mental representations and deduce the other person's emotional state. These results suggest that impaired empathy in individuals with Asperger syndrome may be due to impaired integration of the cognitive and affective facets of the other person's mental state.

12108625		Brief report: postural reactivity to fast visual motion differentiates autistic from children with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	Bruno Gepner, Daniel R Mestre		The aim of the present study was to search for a sensorimotor marker (i.e., visuopostural tuning) that could be correlated with the severity of motor impairments in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Given that autistic children were previously reported to be posturally hyporeactive to visually perceived environmental motion in comparison with normal control children (Gepner et al., 1995), we sought to determine whether children with Asperger syndrome (AS) would share the same postural hyporeactivity to visual motion. Three autistic children with mild to severe motor impairments, three AS children with soft motor signs, and nine normal control children were tested for overall postural instability and postural reactivity to environmental motion. Results indicate, first, that overall postural instability is significantly reduced in autistic children compared with both AS and normal children. Second, although postural oscillations in the fore-aft axis become more attuned to the oscillation frequency of an immersive dynamic visual display as visual speed is increased, in both control and AS subjects, this is not the case in autistic children. Despite the small number of subjects tested in this study, our data confirm the existence of a visuopostural detuning in autistic children. Third, they argue for a correlation between visuopostural tuning and severity of motor signs in children with autistic spectrum disorders. Finally, they suggest a differentiation between children with autism and children with AS with regard to postural reactivity to fast visual motion. Neurophysiological implications of these results are discussed. In particular, a visuocerebellar pathway deficit hypothesis in autism is proposed.
12108620		Reading the mind in the voice: a study with normal adults and adults with Asperger syndrome and high functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	M D Rutherford, Simon Baron-Cohen, Sally Wheelwright		People with high functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger syndrome (AS) have deficits in theory of mind (ToM). Traditional ToM tasks are not sensitive enough to measure ToM deficits in adults, so more subtle ToM tests are needed. One adult level test, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test has shown that AS and HFA subjects have measurable deficits in the ability to make ToM inferences. Here we introduce a test that extends the above task into the auditory domain and that can be used with adults with IQ Scores in the normal range. We report the use of the test with an adult sample of people with AS/HFA and with two adult control groups. Results suggest that individuals with AS/HFA have difficulty extracting mental state information from vocalizations. These results are consistent with previous results suggesting that people with HFA and AS have difficulties drawing ToM inferences.
12108619		A factor analytic study of the Autism Behavior Checklist.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	Fredrika M Miranda-Linné, Lennart Melin		The factor structure of the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) (Krug, Arick, & Almond, 1980a, 1980b), a 57-item screening instrument for autism, was examined on a sample of 383 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (i.e., autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, and other autism-like conditions) aged 5-22 years. A five-factor model accounted for 80% of the total variance in the checklist. Thirty-nine of the 57 items had factor loadings of 0.4 or more, with 13 items loading on Factor 1, 11 items on Factor 2, 6 items on Factor 3, 5 items on Factor 4, and 4 items on Factor 5. No support was found for classifying the 57 items into the five subscales proposed by Krug et al. (1980a, 1980b) or for the three-factor solution suggested by Wadden, Bryson, and Rodger (1991).
12083281		Prevalence of childhood disintegrative disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2002	Eric Fombone	McGill University, Department of Psychiatry, The Montreal Children's Hospital, QC, Canada. eric.fombonne@mcgill.ca	The prevalence of childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD) is unknown. In this study, 32 epidemiological surveys of autism and pervasive developmental disorders published in English language journals since 1966 were reviewed. Four surveys yielded estimates for CDD ranging from 1.1 to 6.4 per 100,000 subjects. A pooled estimate across these four surveys is 1.7 per 100,000 (95 percent Confidence Interval: 0.6-3.8 per 100,000). The conclusion is that CDD is very rare and its prevalence is 60 times less than that for autistic disorder, assuming a prevalence of 10 per 10,000 for autism. If a rate of 30 per 10,000 is taken for all PDDs, only one child out of 175 children with a PDD diagnosis would, on average, meet criteria for CDD.
12077008		Brain anatomy and sensorimotor gating in Asperger's syndrome.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2002	Grainne M McAlonan, Eileen Daly, Veena Kumari, Hugo D Critchley, Therese van Amelsvoort, John Suckling, Andrew Simmons, Thordur Sigmundsson, Kathyrn Greenwood, Ailsa Russell, Nicole Schmitz, Francesca Happe, Patricia Howlin, Declan G M Murphy		Asperger's syndrome (an autistic disorder) is characterized by stereotyped and obsessional behaviours, and pervasive abnormalities in socio-emotional and communicative behaviour. These symptoms lead to social exclusion and a significant healthcare burden; however, their neurobiological basis is poorly understood. There are few studies on brain anatomy of Asperger's syndrome, and no focal anatomical abnormality has been reliably reported from brain imaging studies of autism, although there is increasing evidence for differences in limbic circuits. These brain regions are important in sensorimotor gating, and impaired 'gating' may partly explain the failure of people with autistic disorders to inhibit repetitive thoughts and actions. Thus, we compared brain anatomy and sensorimotor gating in healthy people with Asperger's syndrome and controls. We included 21 adults with Asperger's syndrome and 24 controls. All had normal IQ and were aged 18-49 years. We studied brain anatomy using quantitative MRI, and sensorimotor gating using prepulse inhibition of startle in a subset of 12 individuals with Asperger's syndrome and 14 controls. We found significant age-related differences in volume of cerebral hemispheres and caudate nuclei (controls, but not people with Asperger's syndrome, had age-related reductions in volume). Also, people with Asperger's syndrome had significantly less grey matter in fronto-striatal and cerebellar regions than controls, and widespread differences in white matter. Moreover, sensorimotor gating was significantly impaired in Asperger's syndrome. People with Asperger's syndrome most likely have generalized alterations in brain development, but this is associated with significant differences from controls in the anatomy and function of specific brain regions implicated in behaviours characterizing the disorder. We hypothesize that Asperger's syndrome is associated with abnormalities in fronto-striatal pathways resulting in defective sensorimotor gating, and consequently characteristic difficulties inhibiting repetitive thoughts, speech and actions.

12035268		Harmonizing dilemmas. Siblings of children with DAMP and Asperger syndrome's experiences of coping with their life situations.	Scandinavian journal of caring sciences	2000	L Dellve, L Cernerud, L R Hallberg		The aim of this qualitative study was to describe, from their own perspective and experiences, how siblings of children with deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP) and Asperger syndrome cope with their life situations in their families. Fifteen adolescent females 12-18 years old, siblings of boys with DAMP (8 subjects) and Asperger syndrome (7 subjects), were interviewed. The method used in sampling and analysis of interview protocols was the constant comparative method for grounded theory. The inductive categorization of data produced two core concepts, one about the siblings' life situations in DAMP and Asperger syndrome ('dilemma of requirements and concerns') and one about the siblings' coping processes ('harmonizing'). Of the six categories identified, four were categories of the processes of coping ('gaining understanding', 'gaining independence', 'following a bonding responsibility' and 'balancing'). The qualitative differences between coping processes were related to the two categories of context to cope within the experienced dilemma 'requirements' and 'concerns'. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the siblings' life situations, and may be important for health personnel in encounter families and for identifying siblings with special needs. The findings may also aid in the development of preventive programs for siblings of children with DAMP and Asperger syndrome.
12033714		Head circumference in autism, Asperger syndrome, and ADHD: a comparative study.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2002	Christopher Gillberg, Linda de Souza		This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that children with autistic spectrum disorders often have macrocephalus, and that those without comorbid learning disability are most frequently affected. Fifty consecutive children with Asperger syndrome (45 males, five females; mean age 9 years, range 1 year 6 months to 16 years) without indications of underlying medical disorders were matched for birth year and sex with 50 children (45 males, five females; mean age 6 years 4 months, range 1 year 4 months to 13 years 11 months) who met criteria for autistic disorder (a lower-functioning disorder within the autism spectrum) and with 50 children (45 males, five females; mean age 8 years 4 months, range 1 year 6 months to 15 years 5 months) who met criteria for attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Birth and neuropsychiatric follow-up records were examined and data relating to occipitofrontal circumference, weight, and height were detailed. The group with Asperger syndrome included a subset of individuals with macrocephalus recorded both at birth and at follow-up after the first year of life. Another subgroup developed macrocephalus during early childhood. Autistic spectrum disorders include a subgroup with macrocephalus characterized by a relatively high level of functioning and a clinical presentation most often consistent with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome.

The chief complaint on admission was apnea attacks during sleep. She had severe obesity. Whole night polysomnography showed that the apnea attacks occurred during light and REM sleep, and that slow wave sleep and REM sleep volumes were decreased. These findings were the same as those on adult cases. Weight control was very difficult because of Asperger syndrome.
12027052		Linguistic processing in high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger's syndrome. Is global coherence impaired?	Psychological medicine	2000	T Jolliffe, S Baron-Cohen		Linguistic processing was explored in normally intelligent adults with either autism or Asperger's syndrome, to test if global coherence was impaired. Global coherence is the ability to establish causal connections and interrelate local chunks into higher-order chunks so that most linguistic elements are linked together thematically. Since individuals with autism are hypothesized to have weak central coherence then one would predict that the clinical groups would have difficulty integrating information globally so as to derive full meaning.
12025196		[Investigation of childhood neuropsychiatric disorders in adults often desirable. Functional disabilities can result in social maladjustment].	Lakartidningen	2002	Lena Nylander, Maria Holmqvist, Kerstin Zettervall		So-called child neuropsychiatric disorders (ADHD/DAMP, autism spectrum disorders, Tourette's syndrome) are being recognized with increasing frequency in child and adolescent psychiatry. Through follow-up studies, case reports and autobiographical accounts it has become evident that these disorders often persist into adulthood, and the need for diagnostic evaluation of adults is increasing. The Neuropsychiatric Diagnostic Team for Adults in Lund, Sweden, was established in 1998 to meet this need. 228 adults, mostly 18-30 years old, have completed the diagnostic process, resulting in one of the above-mentioned diagnoses in 64%. 80 patients had ADHD/DAMP, 59 had autism spectrum disorders and 7 had Tourette's syndrome. The diagnostic process involves clinical interviews and observation, neuropsychological evaluation and, if possible, a parent interview. So far, the impact on quality of life of a child neuropsychiatric diagnosis received in adulthood is not known. Follow-up studies are needed.

11952076		Asperger's syndrome and cortical neuropathology.	Journal of child neurology	2002	Manuel F Casanova, Daniel P Buxhoeveden, Andrew E Switala, Emil Roy		Asperger's disorder or syndrome is characterized by impaired social interaction, normal intelligence, and adequate language skills in the areas of grammar and vocabulary. The symptoms are pervasive in nature and usually manifested in childhood. Despite the gravity and chronicity of the condition, the medical literature remains sparse and offers no information about possible neuropathologic underpinnings. The present study is a case report on two patients with Asperger's syndrome. Neuropathologic examination revealed no degenerative changes or gliosis. A more detailed assessment with computerized image analysis indicated abnormalities in the minicolumnar organization of the three areas examined (9, 21, 22) (P = .032). Specifically, minicolumns were smaller, and their component cells were more dispersed than normal. A similar neuropathology has recently been reported for autism and disputes the uniqueness of these findings. The minicolumnar changes provide a possible link to receptive field abnormalities and a useful clinicopathologic correlate to Asperger's syndrome.
11934121		Middle-class mothers' perceptions of peer and sibling victimization among children with Asperger's syndrome and nonverbal learning disorders.	Issues in comprehensive pediatric nursing	2002	Liza Little	Family Research Laboratory & Department of Nursing, University of New Hampshire, Durham 03824, USA. liza.little@unh.edu	This article describes the yearly prevalence and frequency of peer and sibling victimization as reported by a large national sample of middle-class mothers of children with Asperger's syndrome and nonverbal learning disorders. An anonymous, mailed survey was sent to families solicited from two national Internet sites for parents of children with Asperger's and nonverbal learning disorders using the Comprehensive Juvenile Victimization scale and three questions designed to measure peer shunning. The overall prevalence rate reported by mothers of peer victimization was 94%. Mothers reported that almost three-quarters of their children had been hit by peers or siblings in the past year and 75% had been emotionally bullied. On the more severe end of peer victimization, 10% of the children were attacked by a gang in the past year and 15% were victims of nonsexual assaults to the genitals. Peer shunning also was common. A third of the children had not been invited to a single birthday party in the past year, and many were eating alone at lunch or were picked last for teams. Peer shunning was significantly correlated with peer bullying and assault. The high rates of peer shunning and peer victimization reported suggest that children with Asperger's and nonverbal learning disorders may require further scrutiny and attention concerning their victimization experiences by peers and siblings. Implications for nursing professionals are reviewed.

Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2002	Fiona J Scott, Simon Baron-Cohen, Patrick Bolton, Carol Brayne		The article describes a pilot and follow-up study of the preliminary development of a new tool to screen for Asperger syndrome (AS) and related social and communication conditions (the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test, CAST) in children aged 4-11 years, in a non-clinical setting. In the pilot study, parents of 13 children with AS and of 37 typically developing children completed the CAST. There were significant differences between the AS and typical sample means. The pilot was used to establish preliminary cut-off scores for the CAST. In the main study, parents of 1150 primary-school-age children were sent the CAST, and 174 took part in the full data analysis. Results suggest that compared with other tools currently available, the CAST may be useful for identifying children at risk for AS and related conditions, in a mainstream non-clinical sample. Further research is ongoing.

Retrospective analysis of the full blood count and, as far as available, serum ferritin measurements of 96 children (52 with autism and 44 with Asperger syndrome) was undertaken. Six of the autistic group were shown to have iron deficiency anaemia and, of the 23 autistic children who had serum ferritin measured, 12 were iron deficient. Only two of the Asperger group had iron deficiency anaemia and, of the 22 children who had their serum ferritin measured, only three were iron deficient. Iron deficiency, with or without anaemia, can impair cognition and affect and is associated with developmental slowing in infants and mood changes and poor concentration in children. This study showed a very high prevalence of iron deficiency in children with autism, which could potentially compromise further their communication and behavioural impairments.

11916331		Molecular and cytogenetic analyses on Brazilian youths with pervasive developmental disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2002	MarcosRobertoHigino Estécio, Agnes Cristina Fett-Conte, Marileila Varella-Garcia, Cíntia Fridman, Ana Elizabete Silva		The Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDDs) constitute a group of behavioral and neurobiological impairment conditions whose main features are delayed communicative and cognitive development. Genetic factors are reportedly associated with PDDs and particular genetic abnormalities are frequently found in specific diagnostic subgroups such as the autism spectrum disorders. This study evaluated cytogenetic and molecular parameters in 30 youths with autism or other PDDs. The fragile X syndrome was the most common genetic abnormality detected, presented by 1 patient with autism and 1 patient with PPD not-otherwise specified (PPD-NOS). One girl with PDD-NOS was found to have tetrasomy for the 15q11-q13 region, and one patient with autism exhibited in 2/100 metaphases an inv(7)(p35q36), thus suggesting a mosaicism 46,XX/46,XX,inv(7)(p15q36) or representing a coincidental finding. The high frequency of chromosomopathies support the hypothesis that PDDs may develop as a consequence to chromosomal abnormalities and justify the cytogenetic and molecular assessment in all patients with PDDs for establishment of diagnosis.
11885320		Understanding and caring for the child with Asperger syndrome.	The Journal of school nursing : the official publication of the National Association of School Nurses	2001	M R Gardner	School of Nursing, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Stratford, NJ, USA.	Nurses in a variety of settings encounter children with the unfamiliar diagnosis of Asperger syndrome (AS). This disorder, which falls clinically along the autism spectrum, is receiving increasing attention because of its inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) as one of the pervasive developmental disorders. The characteristic features of AS include deficits in social skills, atypical understanding of and use of pragmatic language, behavior problems, and a restricted set of interests. Cognitive abilities vary, and some children with AS have high intelligence. In addition, many children with AS have other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette's syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and depression. The disorder can result in significant functional difficulties in the home, school, and community contexts. A case study highlights the features of AS, and a related individualized school health care plan demonstrates the school nurse's role in family and staff education, monitoring for comorbidities, behavioral management, medication management, support to family members, and referral.

11827611		Autistic traits in obsessive-compulsive disorder.	Nordic journal of psychiatry	2001	S Bejerot, L Nylander, E Lindström		In contrast to other non-psychotic psychiatric populations, subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are more prone to have personality disorder from cluster A (the odd and eccentric cluster). The present study aims at further investigating the relationship between these and other personality traits in OCD subjects and their relation to high functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger disorder. Sixty-four subjects with OCD were included. Personality traits were assessed with the Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP), and personality disorders with DSM-adapted questionnaires. In addition, autistic traits were assessed in 29 videotaped subjects, by 3 independent raters. Twenty percent of the subjects with OCD were identified as also having autistic traits. These subjects scored higher on KSP scales measuring muscular tension, psychasthenia, and inhibition of aggression and lower on socialization as compared with OCD subjects without autistic traits. Additionally, subjects with autistic traits fulfilled criteria for anxious personality disorders and paranoid personality disorders significantly more often than subjects without autistic traits. We propose that OCD is often related to HFA and Asperger disorder. Self-report questionnaires may be useful in establishing the diagnosis. However, those with the most obvious autistic features seem to be less able to identify these traits in themselves.

11817503		A retrospective chart review of risperidone use in treatment-resistant children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders.	Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry	2002	Jovan Simeon, Robert Milin, Selena Walker		Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat a wide variety of child psychiatric disorders characterized by psychotic symptoms, aggression, excitement, tics, stereotypies and hyperactivity nonresponsive to other therapies. Unfortunately, typical antipsychotics have many adverse effects limiting their long-term use. Novel antipsychotics with combined dopaminergic and serotonergic action, such as risperidone, appear to offer better safety and efficacy profiles in controlled studies of adult patients, and therefore appeared as promising pharmacotherapeutic agents in child psychiatry. The purpose of this retrospective chart review was to obtain data on the potential effectiveness and tolerability of risperidone in children and adolescents presenting with a variety of chronic and severe psychiatric disorders who had been unresponsive to previous pharmacological treatments. Charts for 106 children and adolescents (males n = 81 or 76.4%; females n = 25 or 23.6%), presenting with attention deficit and/or hyperactivity disorder (n = 49 or 46.2%), conduct disorder (n = 13 or 12.3%), oppositional-defiant disorder (n = 5 or 4.7%), behavioural problems not otherwise specified (n = 2 or 1.9%), autism (n = 8 or 7.5%), Asperger's syndrome (n = 8 or 7.5%), pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) not otherwise specified (n = 4 or 3.8%), anxiety (n = 6 or 5.7%), depression (n = 2 or 1.9%), dysthymia (n = 2 or 1.9%), schizophrenia (n = 4 or 3.8%), adjustment disorder (n = 1 or 0.9%) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (n = 2 or 1.9%) were reviewed retrospectively to determine the tolerability and potential efficacy of risperidone treatment for a variety of psychiatric disorders. Six subjects also presented with mental retardation. The average length of illness prior to risperidone treatment was 5 years and the average age of risperidone treatment onset was 11 years. The mean daily dose of risperidone was 1.2 mg (range = 0.25 to 8.0 mg). Very few adverse effects were reported. The average length of risperidone treatment was 11 months with the majority (n = 75 or 76%) of patients maintained on risperidone following study termination. Seven cases (6.6%) were missing follow-up data. The majority (n = 78 or 74%) of patients were taking concurrent psychiatric medications, most commonly stimulants for the treatment of ADHD. Clinical global improvements for children and adolescents at the final study visit were marked (n = .37 or 34.9%), moderate (n = .40 or 37.7%), mild (n = 13 or 12.4%), none (n = 12 or 11.3%), or worse (n = 1 or 1%). Three cases (2.9%) were missing clinical improvement data. Results suggest that risperidone may be useful for managing behavioural disturbances and psychotic symptoms associated with a wide variety of childhood psychiatric disorders. For most patients in the study, a combination of risperidone and adjunctive pharmacotherapy was beneficial. Controlled and discontinuation studies of risperidone treatment in children and adolescents with behavioural and psychotic disorders are recommended.
11794411		Real-life-type problem-solving in Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2001	S Channon, T Charman, J Heap, S Crawford, P Rios		This study compared adolescents with Asperger's syndrome with typically developing adolescents on a novel problem-solving task that presented videotaped scenarios in real-life-type social contexts. The Asperger's group was impaired in several aspects of problem-solving, including recounting the pertinent facts, generating possible high-quality problem solutions, and selecting optimal and preferred solutions. This group's solutions differed most from those of the typically developing group in social appropriateness. The contributions of social experience, social understanding, and executive skills to performance on the novel problem-solving task are discussed.
11785613		Juvenile and young adult mentally disordered offenders: the role of child neuropsychiatric disorders.	The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law	2001	L Siponmaa, M Kristiansson, C Jonson, A Nydén, C Gillberg		A retrospective study of the prevalence of child neuropsychiatric disorders was done involving pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and Tourette syndrome in young offenders (15-22 years, n = 126) consecutively referred for presentencing forensic psychiatric investigation (FPI) in Stockholm, Sweden. Most offenders were referred for FPI because of serious offenses. Case report sheets were prepared, and retrospective neuropsychiatric DSM IV diagnoses were made by the first two authors. For best-estimated diagnoses, the case report sheets were then submitted to the fifth author, a child neuropsychiatrist with expertise in this area. Fifteen percent of the subjects had a definite diagnosis of ADHD, and another 15 percent had PDD, including 12 percent PDD not otherwise specified (NOS) and 3 percent Asperger syndrome. Autistic disorder was not found in any case. Tourette syndrome occurred in two percent of the cases. The rate of PDD is particularly striking. Neuropsychiatric diagnoses had been determined in the FPI in only a few cases. The contribution of constitutional problems to later criminal development may have been underestimated.

11769267		Parent and teacher report of pragmatic aspects of communication: use of the children's communication checklist in a clinical setting.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2001	D V Bishop, G Baird		The Children's Communication Checklist (CCC) was developed to provide an objective assessment of pragmatic aspects of children's communication difficulties. We aimed to (1) see whether the checklist provided valid and reliable information when completed by parents, and (2) consider its usefulness in a clinical context. Checklists were completed by parents and a professional who knew the child well for all 5 to 17-year-old referrals to a tertiary developmental paediatrics centre over a 31-month period. Children who were not yet speaking in sentences were excluded. From a sample of 151 children (81% male; mean age 8.7 years) with pervasive or specific developmental disorders, valid checklists were completed by 119 parents and 93 professionals. Reliability, as measured by internal consistency, was 0.7 or higher for most scales. Correlations between ratings for parents and professionals were in the range of 0.30 to 0.58 for individual pragmatic scales, with a correlation of 0.46 (n=82) for the pragmatic composite. For both parents and professionals, the pragmatic composite was lowest for children with a diagnosis of autism; intermediate for those with a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified or attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); and highest for those with a diagnosis of specific learning disability. The strongest relation between the pragmatic composite and diagnosis was seen when ratings from parents and professionals were combined. Differences between diagnostic groups were not explicable in terms of age or verbal IQ.

11766273		An approach towards public health and foodborne human listeriosis--the Austrian Listeria monitoring.	Berliner und Munchener tierarztliche Wochenschrift	2001	H Asperger, M Wagner, E Brandl		The Institute for Milk Hygiene, Milk Technology and Food Science has launched a Listeria monitoring for Austrian cheese factories in 1988 which is nowadays a valuable tool to control the safety of cheese production. It is a means to qualify the proper hygienic conditions in the participating cheese plants. Proper hygiene protects cheese plants from getting contaminated by L. monocytogenes. The preventive elimination of foodborne pathogens facilitates a thriving economical development of the domestic cheese industry as contamination by L. monocytogenes may lead to a stop of delivery, product recall and other costly measures. This report comprehensively describes the principle of the monitoring including a description of the microbiological and molecular tools. It summarizes data on the detection frequency of Listeria contamination with respect to the different matrices under investigation. Furthermore an overview is given on the course of 17 contamination periods in 10 cheese plants and the outcome of the decontamination endeavours is described. Apart from epidemiological investigations, this report summarizes data regarding molecular species confirmation in the genus Listeria as the species assignment was comparatively examined by both conventional microbiology and molecular tools. Genotyping by Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis was applied in three plants which were confronted with a long term contamination period. The data presented in this paper rely on results which were collected through a decade of investigation (1990-2000).
11765086		On the signal response of various pesticides in electrospray and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization depending on the flow-rate of eluent applied in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.	Journal of chromatography. A	2001	A Asperger, J Efer, T Koal, W Engewald		The API-MS signal response of several pesticides (atrazine, simazine, isoproturon, diuron, chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyrifos, alachlor, trifluralin) depending on the flow-rate of eluent entering the MS interface was investigated. The investigations were based on API-MS-MS analyses of standard pesticide mixtures in the flow injection mode (FIA) at systematically varied eluent flow-rates using both an ESI interface (Turboionspray) and a heated nebulizer type APCI source. In the result, the individual compounds included in this study showed significant differences in their signal response behaviour depending on the flow-rate of eluent applied. The most hydrophobic compounds among the investigated pesticides (chlorpyrifos and trifluralin) showed drastic losses of sensitivity with increasing eluent flow-rate in both ESI and APCI, while more hydrophilic compounds like atrazine, simazine and isoproturon showed the expected signal response (concentration-sensitive in ESI, mass-flow-sensitive in APCI) at least within a certain range of flow-rates (200-600 microl/min in ESI, 200-2000 microl/min in APCI). These findings lead to the conclusion that application of a programmed HPLC eluent flow-rate may be advantageous to achieve maximum sensitivity of API-MS detection for all pesticides of interest. This is exemplified by the implementation of a flow gradient into an online SPE-HPLC-APCI-MS/MS method for improved analysis of pesticides in drinking water.

Annual review of psychology	2002	B P Rourke, S A Ahmad, D W Collins, B A Hayman-Abello, S E Hayman-Abello, E M Warriner		"The neuropsychological assets and deficits of several types of pediatric neurological disease, disorder, and dysfunction are described. These are examined from the perspective of the syndrome of nonverbal learning disabilities (NLD) and the ""white matter model"" designed to explain its complex manifestations. It is concluded that children with some of these diseases exhibit the NLD phenotype, whereas others do not. For the most part, the diseases in which the NLD phenotype is particularly evident are those wherein it has been demonstrated that perturbations of white matter (long myelinated fibers) are particularly prominent."
11751642		Pervasive developmental disorder and parental adaptation: previewing and reviewing atypical development with parents in child psychiatric consultation.	Harvard review of psychiatry	2002	Peter Schuntermann	Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, Children's Hospital, and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.	"Parenting young children with pervasive developmental disorder engenders unique sustained stresses, which have been termed ""burden of care."" One specific source of stress for parents is the children's uneven developmental progress, in which delays and accelerations of adaptive functioning may exist side by side. This paper proposes a clinical method that may be incorporated into periodic child psychiatric consultations with parents of young children who have high-functioning autism or Asperger's disorder. Using a semistructured technique, the clinician reviews with the parents the details of the child's recent developmental course and attempts to identify emergent skills that may serve to preview upcoming developmental issues and gains. This method is aimed at enhancing parental abilities to track and anticipate developmental progress and the resultant shifts in the parent-child relationship, in order to reduce one source of sustained parental stress. Case illustrations of children ages 2-8 years old are discussed in light of recent literature on adaptive issues in families of individuals with a chronic medical or psychiatric condition and, specifically, families of children with pervasive developmental disorder."
11725423		Drawing ability in autism: a window into the imagination.	The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences	2001	J Craig, S Baron-Cohen, F Scott		This study investigated imagination via drawing tasks, in 15 children with autism and 15 children with Asperger Syndrome, compared to verbal mental age matched normal children and children with moderate learning difficulties (MLD). Experiment 1 used the Draw an Impossible Man Task. While children with autism were impaired relative to the normal group, they were not impaired relative to the children with MLD. In order to probe for an imagination deficit, Experiment 2 employed a more challenging measure of imaginative drawing, a task involving mixing categories to produce drawings of real or unreal entities (e.g., drawing half-fish/half-mouse). This revealed an autism-specific deficit. Experiment 3 confirmed this was not due to difficulties in combining elements per se. Experiment 4 required subjects to transform a picture (e.g., a cloud into a swan) and again found an autism-specific deficit. Children with Asperger Syndrome were only impaired when required to make such transformations spontaneously.
11708589		Evaluation of a new computer intervention to teach people with autism or Asperger syndrome to recognize and predict emotions in others.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	M Silver, P Oakes		This randomized controlled trial looked at the effect of a new computer program designed to teach people with autistic spectrum disorders to better recognize and predict emotional responses in others. Two groups of 11 children (age 12-18) with autism or Asperger syndrome at two special schools participated: one group used the computer program for 10 half-hour sessions over 2 weeks. Within-program data showed a significant reduction in errors made from first to last use. Students were assessed pre- and post-intervention using facial expression photographs, cartoons depicting emotion-laden situations, and non-literal stories. Scores were not related to age or verbal ability. The experimental group made gains relative to the control group on all three measures. Gains correlated significantly with the number of times the computer program was used and results suggest positive effects. Further research could assess whether these gains generalized into real life or improved performance on theory of mind measures.
11708530		Speech and prosody characteristics of adolescents and adults with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR	2001	L D Shriberg, R Paul, J L McSweeny, A M Klin, D J Cohen, F R Volkmar		Speech and prosody-voice profiles for 15 male speakers with High-Functioning Autism (HFA) and 15 male speakers with Asperger syndrome (AS) were compared to one another and to profiles for 53 typically developing male speakers in the same 10- to 50-years age range. Compared to the typically developing speakers, significantly more participants in both the HFA and AS groups had residual articulation distortion errors, uncodable utterances due to discourse constraints, and utterances coded as inappropriate in the domains of phrasing, stress, and resonance. Speakers with AS were significantly more voluble than speakers with HFA, but otherwise there were few statistically significant differences between the two groups of speakers with pervasive developmental disorders. Discussion focuses on perceptual-motor and social sources of differences in the prosody-voice findings for individuals with Pervasive Developmental Disorders as compared with findings for typical speakers, including comment on the grammatical, pragmatic, and affective aspects of prosody.
11708393		Non-significance of early speech delay in children with autism and normal intelligence and implications for DSM-IV Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	S D Mayes, S L Calhoun		According to the DSM-IV, children with Asperger's disorder do not have significant cognitive or speech delays, whereas children with autistic disorder may or may not. In our study, children with normal intelligence who had clinical diagnoses of autism or Asperger syndrome were divided into two groups: those with and without a significant speech delay. The purpose was to determine if clinically meaningful differences existed between the two groups that would support absence of speech delay as a DSM-IV criterion for Asperger's disorder. No significant differences were found between the 23 children with a speech delay and the 24 children without a speech delay on any of the 71 variables analyzed, including autistic symptoms and expressive language. Results suggest that early speech delay may be irrelevant to later functioning in children who have normal intelligence and clinical diagnoses of autism or Asperger syndrome and that speech delay as a DSM-IV distinction between Asperger's disorder and autism may not be justified.
11708391		A deficit in shifting attention present in high-functioning autism but not Asperger's disorder.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	N J Rinehart, J L Bradshaw, S A Moss, A V Brereton, B J Tonge		The aim of this study was to examine executive functioning, in particular, attentional set-shifting deficits in high-functioning autism (n = 12) and Asperger's disorder (n = 12). A large or global digit composed of smaller or local digits was presented during each trial. The participants indicated the presence of 1s or 2s by pressing the appropriate button. These targets could appear globally or locally Relative to IQ, sex and age matched controls, reaction time to global targets in individuals with autism was retarded when the previous target appeared locally. This deficiency in shifting from local to global processing, however, was not observed in individuals with Asperger's disorder. The theoretical and neurobiological significance of this dissociation in executive functioning in these clinically related disorders was explored.
11708390		The Asperger Syndrome (and high-functioning autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI): a preliminary study of a new structured clinical interview.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	C Gillberg, C Gillberg, M Råstam, E Wentz		The development of the Asperger Syndrome (and high-functioning autism) Diagnostic Interview (ASDI) is described. Preliminary data from a clinical study suggest that inter-rater reliability and test-retest stability may be excellent, with kappas exceeding 0.90 in both instances. The validity appears to be relatively good. No attempt was made in the present study to validate the instrument as regards the distinction between Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism.
11708388		Perceptions of school by two teenage boys with Asperger syndrome and their mothers: a qualitative study.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	S Carrington, L Graham		This qualitative study aimed to develop an understanding of the challenges faced by teenage boys with Asperger syndrome and their mothers. A case study approach was used to collect data from two 13-year-old boys who have Asperger syndrome and their mothers in Queensland, Australia. Data were collected through the use of semistructured interviews. The words of the boys and their mothers provide a valuable insight into the personal experiences and feelings of the participants. An inductive approach to data analysis identified four themes: (1) developmental differences; (2) problems associated with the general characteristics of Asperger syndrome (i.e. communication and social difficulties, restricted range of interests, a need for routine); (3) stress; and (4) 'masquerading'. The first three themes relate strongly to the current literature, but the emergence of masquerading is of particular interest in developing a fuller understanding of the experiences of individuals with Asperger syndrome at school.
11708387		Social and language skills in adolescent boys with Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	C Koning, J Magill-Evans		Twenty-one adolescent boys with Asperger syndrome and 21 boys matched on age and an estimate of IQ were assessed using standardized measures of social perception (Child and Adolescent Social Perception Measure, CASP), social skills (parent, teacher, and student forms of the Social Skills Rating System, SSRS), number of close friends and frequency of contact (Child Behavior Checklist) and expressive and receptive language (Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised). There were significant differences between groups on CASP scores, SSRS scores, number of friends, frequency of contact and social competence. There was also a significant difference on receptive language. The clinically and statistically significant differences between the groups on the measures of social skills help us understand the nature of the social deficits in Asperger syndrome and suggest the need to focus on specific deficits. These findings are discussed in relation to diagnostic criteria and intervention.
11706863		Theory of mind, causal attribution and paranoia in Asperger syndrome.	Autism : the international journal of research and practice	2001	A J Blackshaw, P Kinderman, D J Hare, C Hatton		Theory of mind (ToM) deficits are central to autistic spectrum disorders, including Asperger syndrome. Research in psychotic disorders has developed a cognitive model of paranoid delusions involving abnormal causal attributions for negative events. Possible aetiologies of these include deficits in social reasoning, specifically ToM. The present study investigated this attributional model of paranoia in Asperger syndrome. Participants diagnosed with Asperger syndrome scored significantly higher on a measure of paranoia and lower on a measure of ToM, compared with the control group. They did not differ in self-concept and causal attributions, contrary to the attributional model of paranoia. A regression analysis highlighted private self-consciousness as the only predictor of paranoia. The theoretical and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

11686649		A comparison of WAIS-R profiles in adults with high-functioning autism or differing subtypes of learning disability.	Applied neuropsychology	2001	G Goldstein, S R Beers, D J Siegel, N J Minshew		To examine cognitive differences among adults with differing developmental disorders, a comparison of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revisedprofiles was made with samples of 35 individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and 102 individuals with adult learning disability (LD). All participants had Verbal andPerformance IQ scores of 70 or higher. The LD group was divided into 3 subtypes based on relative achievement levels in mechanical reading and arithmetic. The group with HFA had a profile characterized by a high score on Block Design with a low Comprehension score. The HFA group most resembled the LD subtype that had superior achievement in reading relative to arithmetic, with the exception of their poor performance on measures of social perception and judgment. Results are discussed in terms of the substantial differences in cognitive structure between these 2 neurodevelopmental disorders and are considered in the context of the learning deficits reported for Asperger 's Disorder and nonverbal learning disability.

Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	2001	D J Posey, K D Guenin, A E Kohn, N B Swiezy, C J McDougle		The aim of this study was to conduct a naturalistic, open-label examination of the efficacy and tolerability of mirtazapine (a medication with both serotonergic and noradrenergic properties) in the treatment of associated symptoms of autism and other pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs).
11600171		Asperger's disorder in the emergency psychiatric setting.	General hospital psychiatry	2001	M Raja, A Azzoni		Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder that may be unrecognized, especially if signs of other psychiatric disorders coexist. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to ascertain the prevalence of AS in the emergency psychiatric setting; and 2) to describe features of AS which may help to differentiate these patients from patients with psychotic disorders. Among 2500 patients admitted to a psychiatric intensive care unit, 5 (0.2%) received a diagnosis of AS, for the first time. Besides impairment of social interaction, common features were the following: male gender, left handedness, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, cognitive hyper-abilities, violent behavior, sense of humor, low WAIS total score, high WAIS verbal/performance score ratio, unusual, restricted interest and clumsiness. Comorbid schizophrenia is difficult to rule out in these patients. Psychotic symptoms should not be overvalued in making the diagnosis when specific features of AS are present.

Series B, Biological sciences	2001	J M Gardiner	Psychology Group, School of Cognitive & Computing Sciences, University of Sussex, Falmer, Brighton BN1 9RH, UK. johngar@cogs.susx.ac.uk	Episodic memory is identified with autonoetic consciousness, which gives rise to remembering in the sense of self-recollection in the mental re-enactment of previous events at which one was present. Autonoetic consciousness is distinguished from noetic consciousness, which gives rise to awareness of the past that is limited to feelings of familiarity or knowing. Noetic consciousness is identified not with episodic but with semantic memory, which involves general knowledge. A recently developed approach to episodic memory makes use of 'first-person' reports of remembering and knowing. Studies using this approach have revealed many independent variables that selectively affect remembering and others that selectively affect knowing. These studies can also be interpreted in terms of distinctiveness and fluency of processing. Remembering and knowing do not correspond with degrees of confidence in memory. Nor does remembering always control the memory response. There is evidence that remembering is selectively impaired in various populations, including not only amnesic patients and older adults but also adults with Asperger's syndrome. This first-person approach to episodic memory represents one way in which that most elusive aspect of consciousness, its subjectivity, can be investigated scientifically. The two kinds of conscious experiences can be manipulated experimentally in ways that are systematic, replicable and intelligible theoretically.

Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk	2001	V M Bashina		The paper provides clinical and catamnestic descriptions of 240 children with infantile autism; 160 with atypical autism (of them 100 had schizophrenic attacks, 60 presented with mental retardation concurrent with atypical autism (in phenylketonuria, tuberose sclerosis, Down syndrome, Martin-Bell syndrome), 20 with Asperger's syndrome, 60 with Rett's syndrome, 20 with psychogenic paraautism according the Nissen classification. The similarity of autism-like disorders and atypical autism was considered. Syndromal verifications in accordance with ICD-10 (1994) and ICD-10 (1999) in Russian versions and clinical nosological verifications adopted in Russia were studied in all the examinees. New approaches to treating patients with autistic disorders were developed.

11518482		Obstetric complications and risk for severe psychopathology in childhood.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2001	W W Eaton, P B Mortensen, P H Thomsen, M Frydenberg		The purpose of the study was to assess the association of obstetric complications with risk for mental disorders resulting in hospitalization before the age of 15. Records from all births in Denmark from 1973 through 1993 were linked to records of all psychiatric hospitalizations. Diagnoses were grouped into seven broad categories. A reference population of 10% of births in Denmark from 1973 to 1990 was used for comparison. Obstetric complications were associated with the range of mental disorders occurring in childhood. The strongest predictors were a variable indicating the interaction of birth weight with speed of growth and the 5-minute Apgar score. There was no diagnostic group that stood out as different with respect to obstetric complications. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of the continuum of reproductive casualty.

11511110		Molecular characterization of the 56-kDa CYP153 from Acinetobacter sp. EB104.	Biochemical and biophysical research communications	2001	T Maier, H H Förster, O Asperger, U Hahn		CYP153 a cytochrome P450 from Acinetobacter sp. EB104 catalyzes the hydroxylation of unsubstituted n-alkanes. We have decided to use the CYP153 system as a model for mechanistic studies on regioselective n-alkane oxidation and the interaction of hydrophobic substrates with soluble enzymes. Here the molecular cloning of the CYP153 gene is reported. Single specific primer PCR was applied to yield the whole gene sequence via chromosomal walks. CYP153 consists of 497 amino acids (M(r) = 56 kDa) and thus represents an unusually long bacterial P450, containing all P450 typical structural elements. It constitutes the new P450 family CYP153. The prolonged N-terminus of about 90 amino acids does not contain a so far known membrane-anchoring sequence but a 28-amino acid long amphipathic helix. The relevance of the remarkably long N-terminus and of other sequence motives like the hydrophobic F-G loop is discussed with respect to substrate binding and recognition.

Journal of personality assessment	2001	M Holaday, J Moak, M A Shipley		Rorschach protocols from 24 boys with Asperger's Disorder matched by age to 24 boys with other emotional or behavioral disorders (the contrast group) were compared to each other and to Exner' s (1995) normative data. Eight variables based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed. [DSM-IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) criteria and a review of the literature for Asperger's Disorder were predicted to discriminate between groups with the Asperger's group having more extreme scores. Five variables (COP, CDI, H, M, and EA) were significantly different from the contrast group and T and WSumC were significantly different from the normative data in both the Asperger's group and the contrast group.
11488363		An open trial of divalproex sodium in autism spectrum disorders.	The Journal of clinical psychiatry	2001	E Hollander, R Dolgoff-Kaspar, C Cartwright, R Rawitt, S Novotny		Autism spectrum disorders are characterized by core deficits in social interaction and speech/communication skills, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. Other abnormalities include seizures, electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities, affective instability, impulsivity, and aggression. Divalproex sodium is indicated as both an anticonvulsant in epilepsy and a mood stabilizer in bipolar illness and thus might be useful for these complicating symptoms in autism.
11478225		[Speech development and intelligence in autism. How uniform is Asperger syndrome?].	Der Nervenarzt	2001	D Rühl, S Bölte, F Poustka		"Since the introduction of a separate diagnosis for Asperger's syndrome in the ICD-10 and DSM-IV classification systems, a controversial debate has continued on whether Asperger's syndrome is a specific, clearly distinguishable disorder within the autistic spectrum or whether it represents a milder phenotypical variation of autism. The effect on the amount of autistic symptoms of the variables language delay and level of intelligence was analyzed within a sample of individuals exhibiting autism diagnosed by standardized methods. Both variables showed a significant effect on the degree of autistic symptoms in that impairments in social interaction were less noticeable. In addition, a subsample of individuals exhibited symptoms assumed to be characteristic for Asperger's syndrome. The findings support the assumption that autism and Asperger's syndrome represent ""extreme points"" on a scale of severity, which leads to the suggestion that the classification of different subtypes of autism could be abandoned in favor of a dimensional (multiaxial) approach."
11469282		Do autism spectrum disorders differ from each other and from non-spectrum disorders on emotion recognition tests?	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2001	M J Dyck, K Ferguson, I M Shochet		We tested whether dimensional measures of empathic ability, theory of mind, and intelligence would differentiate autism spectrum disorders from each other and from non-spectrum disorders. Tests were administered to children with a diagnosis of Autistic Disorder (AutD; n = 20), Asperger's Disorder (AspD; n = 28), Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (Inattentive Type) (ADHD; n = 35), Mental Retardation (Mild) (MR; n = 34), Anxiety Disorder (AnxD; n = 14), or No Psychological Disorder (NPD; n = 36). Results showed that empathic ability discriminated among groups on the autism spectrum (AutD < AspD < NPD). Because empathic ability is not independent of intelligence (AutD < AspD < NPD on intelligence; MR < ADHD < NPD on empathic ability), both dimensions are necessary to discriminate autism spectrum from non-spectrum disorders. When intelligence is covaried, empathic ability discriminated AutD, but not AspD, from other disorders (AutD < MR < ADHD < NPD = AnxD = AspD).
11466160	doi: 10.1017/S1461145701002280	Effect of fluoxetine on regional cerebral metabolism in autistic spectrum disorders: a pilot study.	The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology	2001	M S Buchsbaum, E Hollander, M M Haznedar, C Tang, J Spiegel-Cohen, T C Wei, A Solimando, B R Buchsbaum, D Robins, C Bienstock, C Cartwright, S Mosovich		The regional metabolic effects of fluoxetine were examined in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Six adult patients with DSM-IV and Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI) diagnoses of autism (n = 5) and Asperger's syndrome (n = 1), entered a 16-wk placebo-controlled cross-over trial of fluoxetine. The patients received (18)F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography with co-registered magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and at the end of the period of fluoxetine administration. After treatment, the patients showed significant improvement on the scores of the Yale--Brown Obsessive--Compulsive Scale -- Obsessions subscale and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale; Clinical Global Impressions -- Autism scores showed 3 of the patients much improved and 3 unchanged. Relative metabolic rates were significantly higher in the right frontal lobe following fluoxetine, especially in the anterior cingulate gyrus and the orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with higher metabolic rates in the medial frontal region and anterior cingulate when unmedicated were more likely to respond favourably to fluoxetine. These results are consistent with those in depression indicating that higher cingulate gyrus metabolic rates at baseline predict SRI response.
11452361		A genomewide screen for autism susceptibility loci.	American journal of human genetics	2001			"We report the analysis of 335 microsatellite markers genotyped in 110 multiplex families with autism. All families include at least two ""affected"" siblings, at least one of whom has autism; the remaining affected sibs carry diagnoses of either Asperger syndrome or pervasive developmental disorder. Affected sib-pair analysis yielded multipoint maximum LOD scores (MLS) that reach the accepted threshold for suggestive linkage on chromosomes 5, X, and 19. Nominal evidence for linkage (point-wise P<.05) was obtained on chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, and 20, and secondary loci were found on chromosomes 5 and 19. Analysis of families sharing alleles at the putative X chromosomal linked locus and one or more other putative linked loci produced an MLS of 3.56 for the DXS470-D19S174 marker combination. In an effort to increase power to detect linkage, scan statistics were used to evaluate the significance of peak LOD scores based on statistical evidence at adjacent marker loci. This analysis yielded impressive evidence for linkage to autism and autism-spectrum disorders with significant genomewide P values <.05 for markers on chromosomes 5 and 8 and with suggestive linkage evidence for a marker on chromosome 19."
11439759		Brief report: macrographia in high-functioning adults with autism spectrum disorder.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2001	D Q Beversdorf, J M Anderson, S E Manning, S L Anderson, R E Nordgren, G J Felopulos, M L Bauman		The initial description of Asperger syndrome commented on the poor handwriting and motor coordination difficulties of individuals with this condition. Early descriptions of autism do not remark upon such difficulties. Recent evidence, however, suggests that individuals with both conditions have a similar motor control impairment. Handwriting has not been formally assessed in this context. Our study compared handwriting size between individuals with autism spectrum disorder and age- and IQ-matched control subjects. Macrographia was observed among subjects with autism spectrum disorder which remained statistically significant when covaried with educational level. This finding may correlate with the anatomical abnormalities present in the cerebellum of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.
11439757		Movement preparation in high-functioning autism and Asperger disorder: a serial choice reaction time task involving motor reprogramming.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2001	N J Rinehart, J L Bradshaw, A V Brereton, B J Tonge		"Autism and Asperger disorder have long been associated with movement abnormalities, although the neurobehavioural details of these abnormalities remain poorly defined. Clumsiness has traditionally been associated with Asperger disorder but not autism, although this is controversial. Others have suggested that both groups demonstrate a similar global motor delay. In this study we aimed to determine whether movement preparation or movement execution was atypical in these disorders and to describe any differences between autism and Asperger disorder. A simple motor reprogramming task was employed. The results indicated that individuals with autism and Asperger disorder have atypical movement preparation with an intact ability to execute movement. An atypical deficit in motor preparation was found in Asperger disorder, whereas movement preparation was characterized by a ""lack of anticipation"" in autism. The differences in movement preparation profiles in these disorders were suggested to reflect differential involvement of the fronto-striatal region, in particular the supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate."
11439754		The autism-spectrum quotient (AQ): evidence from Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism, males and females, scientists and mathematicians.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2001	S Baron-Cohen, S Wheelwright, R Skinner, J Martin, E Clubley		Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0-50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4% of men did so. Twice as many men (40%) as women (21%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6% of the student sample scored 32+ on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test-retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.
11439753		Inferential language in high-function children with autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2001	M Dennis, A L Lazenby, L Lockyer		Despite average verbal intelligence, high-function children with autism have social comprehension deficits that are expressed by how they use and understand language. In this paper, we explored the general hypothesis that high-function children with autism make some, but not all, of the pragmatic inferences necessary for successful communication, even when they have the ability to perform noninferential language tasks. We contrasted the ability of 8 high-function children with autism (each with Verbal IQ > 70) and typically developing children to use and understand: pragmatic inferences about given or presupposed knowledge in mental state words; pragmatic inferences about new or implied knowledge in mental state words; bridging inferences essential for coherence; elaborative inferences involved in enriching a communication by means of figurative language; and the intentional inferences involved in speech acts. High-function children with autism could define words and identify multiple meanings for ambiguous words. In understanding words for mental states, they made inferences from mental state verbs to given or presupposed knowledge. However, they failed to infer what mental state verbs implied in context; to make inferences about social scripts; to understand metaphor; and to produce speech acts, all of which are inferences that are the basis of successful social communication because they elaborate meaning or convey intentions.

Indian journal of psychiatry	2001	H S Duggal, S Dutta, V K Sinha, S Basu, S Pandey, H S Nizamie, A Nizamie		Asperger's syndrome is an autistic spectrum disorder, which has engendered lesser attention in comparison to autism. Recent literature has focused on the involvement of cortical areas of the brain in this syndrome. We report a case of Asperger's syndrome in which an extensive work-up, including neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroimaging procedures, were undertaken. The findings of the various investigative procedures are discussed and literature supporting the neurobiological basis of Asperger's syndrome is highlighted. Finally, we briefly touch upon the 'Theory of Mind' construct in autistic spectrum disorders.
11417262		[The course of infantile autism through adulthood. An overview of long-term follow-up data].	Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie	2001	K Schonauer, M Klar, H E Kehrer, V Arolt		The symptoms of infantile autism were first described almost 60 years ago. In contrast to its course in puberty and adolescence, follow-up-data on the late course in adulthood are decidedly sparse. As the outcome of research in the literature, we found 21 methodologically heterogeneous follow-up-studies. The arithmetic mean age of all subjects investigated was 24.0 years. The results are supplemented by various case reports and sporadic biographical reports by affected persons. On the basis of the available data, the discontinuous and dynamic changes of course verified in puberty and adolescence are not applicable to the third and fourth decades to the same extent. Gains in competence and autonomy appear to develop in the vocational rather than in the domestic sphere. The significantly more favorable courses of the form described by Asperger are continued in adulthood. The disorder-associated lack of empathy and social interaction is by no means experienced in terms of self-satisfaction by those concerned but rather as a loss. Interpersonal sexual needs are expressed by a substantial proportion of autistic adults. The cumulative mortality rates of the follow-up-studies suggest that the mortality rate among autistic patients is higher than among their non-autistic peers.
11411788		Does DSM-IV Asperger's disorder exist?	Journal of abnormal child psychology	2001	S D Mayes, S L Calhoun, D L Crites		DSM-IV criteria for autistic and Asperger's disorders were applied to 157 children with clinical diagnoses of autism or Asperger's disorder. All children met the DSM-IV criteria for autistic disorder and none met criteria for Asperger's disorder, including those with normal intelligence and absence of early speech delay. The reason for this was that all children had social impairment and restricted and repetitive behavior and interests (required DSM-IV symptoms for both autistic and Asperger's disorders) and all had a DSM-IV communication impairment (which then qualified them for a diagnosis of autistic disorder and not Asperger's disorder). Communication problems exhibited by all children were impaired conversational speech or repetitive, stereotyped, or idiosyncratic speech (or both), which are DSM-IV criteria for autism. These findings are consistent with those of 5 other studies and indicate that a DSM-IV diagnosis of Asperger's disorder is unlikely or impossible.
11407161		Clinical considerations in the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders.	Indian journal of pediatrics	2001	G Baird, T Charman, P J Santosh		The diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) is being made more frequently in children and at younger ages. This paper discusses various factors to be considered in the screening of autism, early features of presentation, relevant to assessment and diagnosis, subtypes or different syndromes within the spectrum of autistic conditions including Asperger syndrome, the differential diagnosis from learning and language disorders and the medical and behavioural commonly associated disorders.
11391493		[Sleep in infantile autism].	Revista de neurologia		B Abril, M Méndez, O Sans, J R Valdizán		Analysis of nocturnal sleep in infantile autism has been presented in various studies. However, there has been no systematization including the different structural and paroxystic alterations at the same time as permitting the development of a general theory of the effect of sleep on prognosis and treatment, particularly in a spectrum in which there is currently no definite solution.
11383970		Susceptibility to illusions and performance on visuospatial tasks in individuals with autism.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2001	D Ropar, P Mitchell		The current study follows a recent paper reporting that individuals with autism were just as susceptible to visual illusions as those without autism (Ropar & Mitchell, 1999). The possibility that individual differences may account for the failure to replicate Happe's (1996) findings is explored by presenting a battery of visuospatial tasks thought to measure weak central coherence (embedded figures, block design, Rey complex figure test). Participants with autism were distinguished by relatively good performance on visuospatial tasks, though there was no superiority effect in those with Asperger's syndrome. Performance on the visuospatial battery did not significantly predict susceptibility to illusions in various participant groups, including those with autism and Asperger's syndrome. This suggests that perception of illusions and performance on visuospatial tasks may rely on different mechaisms. The implications for the theory of weak central coherence are discussed.
11383012		[Current status of autism studies].	Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica	2001	H Kurita	Department of Mental Health, Tokyo University Graduate School of Medicine.	The current status of autism studies was reviewed based on English articles published during the 1990s. Although the concepts of autism and pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) are established, diagnostic criteria of PDDNOS or atypical autism, which is frequently difficult to differentiate from autism, need to be established. The prevalence of autism has been estimated as about 0.05% in the U.S and many European countries, while it was reported to be 0.1% or higher in Japan and some European countries, though the reasons for this difference are unclear. High-functioning (IQ > or = 70) autism may not be as rare a condition as previously thought and both its difference from and similarity to Asperger's syndrome, the highest functioning PDD subtype, need clarification. About 20 to 40% of children with autism lose meaningful words by the age of 2 years and display autistic symptoms thereafter. Such autism, called the setback type in Japan, has been demonstrated to have a poorer adolescent/adult outcome compared to autism without setback and its relationship with childhood disintegrative disorder, which displays a clearer regression after normal development for at least the first 2 years of life, needs to be addressed. The etiology of autism is now considered mostly genetic for reasons, such as the significantly higher concordance rate of autism in identical twin pairs (60-80%) than in fraternal twin pairs (0-10%) and an 3-5% incidence of autism among sibs of an autism proband, 30 to 100 times higher than that in the general population. The involvement of several genes is implicated to create susceptibility for autism, yet the responsible genes have not been identified. Although there is no medication to cure autism, some psychotropic drugs, such as antipsychotics and SSRIs, seem effective for behavior problems in autism patients. Psychosocial treatments are the main therapeutic approach to autism, though they are yet to be well systematized. It is important to evaluate various autism treatments now practiced and to integrate effective ones into an efficient therapeutic system. Early diagnosis of PDD, support for the mother to develop a better relationship with her autistic infant, enrollment of an autistic infant in a day care for handicapped or non-handicapped infants, education in a relevant school, vocational training, treatment of behavior problems, and establishing social welfare services are a framework of the therapeutic system of autism. Much should be done to improve the long-term outcome of autism patients, including high-functioning autism.
11369965		Asperger's syndrome.	Saudi medical journal	2000	M H Al-Eithan	Psychology Department, King Saud University, PO Box 2458, Riyadh 11451, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. meithan@ksu.edu.sa	This study presents a 14-year-old Saudi child with poor school achievement, diagnosed by psychiatrists as mentally retardated with a significant social deficit. No neurological disorder was evident. She has high to very high intellectual abilities on testing her intelligence quotient. Her verbal learning ability was also very high. Her social skills and capacity were impaired. No evidence of poor language was detected. The patient is diagnosed as suffering from Asperger's syndrome, and not mentally retarded. She has the criteria for Asperger's syndrome according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition, including the significant social deficit with normal intellectual functioning. The utility of such a diagnosis is briefly discussed.
11332785		"""Motor"" impairment in Asperger syndrome: evidence for a deficit in proprioception."	Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP	2001	A K Weimer, A M Schatz, A Lincoln, A O Ballantyne, D A Trauner		"Motor impairment has frequently been described in Asperger syndrome (AS), a pervasive developmental disorder included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV). Previous research focusing on this motor dysfunction has yielded inconsistent results, and the ""clumsiness"" observed clinically remains poorly defined. To clarify further the issue of motor impairment, we compared a group of 10 children and young adults who met DSM-IV criteria for AS with a control group with no neurological impairment. Subjects were matched on age, sex, socioeconomic status, and Verbal IQ. A broad battery of motoric tests was administered. Subjects with AS were found to perform more poorly than controls on tests of apraxia, one-leg balance with eyes closed, tandem gait, and repetitive finger-thumb apposition. No significant differences were found on tests of finger tapping, grooved pegboard, trail making, or visual-motor integration. The pattern of impairments suggests that a proprioceptive deficit may underlie the incoordination observed in AS and that these individuals may be overreliant on visual input to maintain balance and position in space."
11332459		Functional magnetic resonance imaging in children with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of child neurology	2001	F Oktem, B Diren, E Karaagaoglu, B Anlar		Asperger's syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder of unknown etiology. We evaluated children with this syndrome (n = 9) and control (n = 8) children by functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during a task involving social judgment. All control and 5 of 9 subjects with Asperger's syndrome showed signal intensity changes in frontal regions. Four patients with Asperger's syndrome, including one case with right frontal dysplasia, had no signal intensity change during the task. In this first functional MRI study of childhood Asperger's syndrome, frontal activation patterns demonstrated some differences between patients and normal subjects. Further studies using other functions frequently impaired in Asperger's syndrome are warranted.
11321200		"Exploring the cognitive phenotype of autism: weak ""central coherence"" in parents and siblings of children with autism: II. Real-life skills and preferences."	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2001	J Briskman, F Happé, U Frith		Information on everyday life activities and preferences in both social and nonsocial domains was obtained from parents and children who had taken part in an experimental study of central coherence. Comparisons were made between parents who had a son with autism, parents with a dyslexic son, and families without a history of developmental disorder, as well as the male siblings in these families. Data on everyday preferences and abilities were elicited by means of an experimental questionnaire. Significant group differences in social and nonsocial preferences were found, suggesting that some parents showed similarities with their son with autism, in preference for nonsocial activities and ability in detail-focused processing. A similar experimental questionnaire, completed by parents on behalf of their sons, discriminated between autism group probands and controls, but did not differentiate sibling groups. The relevance of the nonsocial items to central coherence is discussed in the light of the findings in Part I: autism parents who reported more autism-related nonsocial (but not social) preferences, tended to show a piecemeal processing style on the experimental tasks.
11321199		"Exploring the cognitive phenotype of autism: weak ""central coherence"" in parents and siblings of children with autism: I. Experimental tests."	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2001	F Happé, J Briskman, U Frith		"Previous twin and family studies have indicated that there are strong genetic influences in the etiology of autism, and provide support for the notion of a broader phenotype in first-degree relatives. The present study explored this phenotype in terms of one current cognitive theory of autism. Parents and brothers of boys with autism, boys with dyslexia, and normal boys were given tests of ""central coherence"", on which children with autism perform unusually well due to an information-processing bias favouring part/detail processing over processing of wholes/meaning. Results indicated that fathers of boys with autism, as a group, showed piecemeal processing across four tests of central coherence. This was not true for any other group. These findings raise the possibility that the broader autism phenotype may include a ""cognitive style"" (weak central coherence) that can confer information-processing advantages."
11315539		Disordered recognition of facial identity and emotions in three Asperger type autists.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	2001	C Njiokiktjien, A Verschoor, L de Sonneville, C Huyser, V Op het Veld, N Toorenaar		In this report we aim to explore severe deficits in facial affect recognition in three boys all of whom meet the criteria of Asperger's syndrome (AS), as well as overt prosopagnosia in one (B) and covert prosopagnosia in the remaining two (C and D). Subject B, with a familially-based talent of being highly gifted in physics and mathematics, showed no interest in people, a quasi complete lack of comprehension of emotions, and very poor emotional reactivity. The marked neuropsychological deficits were a moderate prosopagnosia and severely disordered recognition of facial emotions, gender and age. Expressive facial emotion, whole body psychomotor expression and speech prosody were quasi absent as well. In all three boys these facial processing deficits were more or less isolated, and general visuospatial functions, attention, formal language and scholastic performances were normal or even highly developed with the exception of deficient gestalt perception in B. We consider the deficient facial emotion perception as an important pathogenetic symptom for the autistic behaviour in the three boys. Prosopagnosia, the absent facial and bodily expression, and speech prosody were important but varying co-morbid disorders. The total clinical picture of non-verbal disordered communication is a complex of predominantly bilateral and/or right hemisphere cortical deficits. Moreover, in B, insensitivity to pain, smells, noises and internal bodily feelings suggested a more general emotional anaesthesia and/or a deficient means of expression. It is possible that a limbic component might be involved, thus making affective appreciation also deficient.
11280420		"The ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes"" Test revised version: a study with normal adults, and adults with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism."	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2001	S Baron-Cohen, S Wheelwright, J Hill, Y Raste, I Plumb		"In 1997 in this Journal we published the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes"" Test, as a measure of adult ""mentalising"". Whilst that test succeeded in discriminating a group of adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) from controls, it suffered from several psychometric problems. In this paper these limitations are rectified by revising the test. The Revised Eyes Test was administered to a group of adults with AS or HFA (N = 15) and again discriminated these from a large number of normal controls (N = 239) drawn from different samples. In both the clinical and control groups the Eyes Test was inversely correlated with the Autism Spectrum Quotient (the AQ), a measure of autistic traits in adults of normal intelligence. The Revised Eyes Test has improved power to detect subtle individual differences in social sensitivity."
11280419		Development and current functioning in adolescents with Asperger syndrome: a comparative study.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2001	A Gilchrist, J Green, A Cox, D Burton, M Rutter, A Le Couteur		Adolescents with Asperger syndrome (AS: without delay in speech development, diagnosed according to ICD-10 clinical criteria) were compared with a group with high-functioning autism (HFA: all with delayed speech development), and a group with conduct disorder (CD). Family and genetic studies suggest that Asperger syndrome and autism form part of the same spectrum, whereas the social impairments in conduct disorder are assumed to have different origins. The aims were to explore the relationships between early speech development and other aspects of functioning in autistic disorders, and to compare autistic and nonautistic social impairments. Early and current behaviour and IQ profiles were investigated. The CD group were clearly different from both the AS and HFA groups. The AS group tended to have less severe early behavioural abnormalities than the HFA group, and were unlikely to have speech abnormalities, but other communicative, social, and restricted/ stereotyped behavioural difficulties were largely of a similar pattern to the abnormalities in the HFA group. Eighty per cent of the AS group met criteria for autism on the diagnostic algorithm associated with the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. By adolescence, the AS group were reported to be as abnormal as the HFA group but in structured 1:1 interaction their conversation was better. IQ profile in the AS group showed relative strength on verbal measures, unlike the HFA group, but relatively good performance on the Block Design subtest of the WISC/WAIS was a feature of both the AS and HFA groups. The results indicate closely similar behavioural manifestations may arise by adolescence despite differences in speech development. Follow-up studies and further family investigations will be required to clarify the origins of these and other patterns of autistic development.
11263686		Neurocognitive stability in Asperger syndrome, ADHD, and reading and writing disorder: a pilot study.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2001	A Nydén, E Billstedt, E Hjelmquist, C Gillberg		Boys with Asperger syndrome (n=20), attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (n=20), and reading and writing disorder (n=20) were followed up and retested on several neuropsychological measures 1 to 2 years after initial assessments. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-III) Full Scale, Verbal, and Performance IQ scores remained stable for all diagnostic groups. Kaufman factors and 'fluid' and 'crystallized' abilities were also stable measures. Subtest stability over time, was slightly more variable. There was a tendency for the group with Asperger syndrome to deteriorate over time with respect to logical reasoning abilities. Measures of executive function/attention ('go-no-go' and 'conflict' tests) showed good test-retest stability in all diagnostic groups. This is the first study of its kind.
11263685		The 2nd to 4th digit ratio and autism.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	2001	J T Manning, S Baron-Cohen, S Wheelwright, G Sanders		It has been suggested that autism may arise as the result of exposure to high concentrations of prenatal testosterone. There is evidence that the ratio of the lengths of the 2nd and 4th digit (2D:4D) may be negatively correlated with prenatal testosterone. We measured 2D:4D in 95 families recruited via the National Autistic Society, UK. The sample comprised a total 72 children with autism (62 males, 10 females; age range 2 to 14 years), including 23 children (20 males, three females) with Asperger syndrome (AS), 34 siblings, 88 fathers, 88 mothers and sex- and age-matched control participants. We found that the 2D:4D ratios of children with autism, their siblings, fathers and mothers were lower than population normative values. Children with AS, who share the social and communicative symptoms of autism but have normal or even high IQ, had higher 2D:4D ratios than children with autism but lower ratios than population normative values. There were positive associations between 2D:4D ratios of children with autism and the ratios of their relatives. Children with autism had lower than expected 2D:4D ratios and children with AS higher ratios than expected in relation to their fathers' 2D:4D ratio. It was concluded that 2D:4D ratio may be a possible marker for autism which could implicate prenatal testosterone in its aetiology.

It was not until 1980 that autistic spectrum disorders were officially recognized as disorders of development and not of psychoses (Wing, 1996). (In this article the term 'autism' will be used to refer to all individuals diagnosed across the autistic spectrum, including people with Asperger syndrome.) There will be many adults with autism aged over 20 years of age who are not appropriately diagnosed and who are not receiving relevant care (Trevarthen et al, 1998). Many will have been the victims of a medical model of treatment as opposed to receiving the necessary education and support. This article, the second of a two-part series (the first article (Vol 9(12): 779-84) dealt with children with autism) will explore how contemporary knowledge can help healthcare professionals to support adults with autism in the development of positive self-identities.
11248465		Alleviation of sleep disturbance and repetitive behavior by a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor in a boy with Asperger's syndrome.	Brain & development	2001	J Furusho, K Matsuzaki, I Ichihashi, H Satoh, K Yamaguchi, K Kumagai		An 8 year-old boy with Asperger's syndrome had difficulties in communicating with his teachers and classmates. He occasionally stole out of the classroom. He could not sleep at night recalling his awful experience and kept crying every night and refused to go to school. The treatment with fluvoxamine was started at the dose of 25 mg daily. Four weeks after the treatment, his repetitive behavior and hyperactivity decreased and night crying diminished. Although he still has difficulties in communicating with others, he is now able to attend extra-curricular classes in a private school. Fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor that has been mainly used for patients with depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, might be effective for compulsive symptoms and sleep disturbance of patients with pervasive developmental disorders.
11234553		[Asperger syndrome: an update].	Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie	2001	H Remschmidt, J Hebebrand		Asperger's Syndrome is a pervasive developmental disorder that manifest itself at pre-school age. It is characterized by qualitative impairments of social interaction, deficits in empathy, motor disturbances, and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests and activities. A genetic etiology is assumed in context with brain dysfunctions and neuropsychological deficits which are all focused upon nonverbal learning, even though the general intellectual level is within the normal range. Treatment must take into account the individual aspects of each case and is based mainly on behavior therapy, group training of social skills, vocational training and adaptation, and if necessary, on medication. Medical treatment is indicated in the presence of special symptoms such as hyperactivity, aggressive behavior, sleep disorders, or depression.

Psychotherapie des Kindes- u. Jugendalters, Univ.-Klinikum Charité, Campus Mitte, Med. Fakultät der Humboldt-Univ. zu Berlin. klaus-j.neumaerker@charite.de	Austistic disorders characteristically involve specific impairments of social skills, of the language and of stereotyped body movements. L Kanner and H. Asperger were the first to describe these psychopathologic features, which still form the core of the diagnostic criteria of contemporary psychiatric classification systems, ICD-10 and DSM-IV, in the category pervasive developmental disorders. Useful diagnostic tools have been developed to establish the clinical diagnosis. The results of research point to a predominantly genetic pathogenesis involving a complex interaction of multiple genes. While no causal treatments are available for these heterogenic disorders, there are many therapeutic concepts. Although some treatments may achieve significant improvements, autistic disorders usually mean a lifelong individual impairment.

11195990		Memory illusions: false recall and recognition in adults with Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of abnormal psychology	2000	D M Bowler, J M Gardiner, S Grice, P Saavalainen		As persons on the autistic spectrum are known not to use semantic features of word lists to aid recall, they might show diminished susceptibility to illusory memories that typically occur with lists of associated items. Alternatively, since such individuals also have poor source monitoring, they might show greater susceptibility. The authors found that adults with Asperger's syndrome (n = 10) recalled similar proportions of a nonpresented strong associate of the study list items, compared with controls (n = 15). In Experiment 2, rates of true and false recognition of study list associates did not differ significantly between Asperger (n = 10) and control (n = 10) participants. Moreover, the Asperger participants made fewer remember and more know judgments than controls for veridical but not for false recognitions. Thus, deficits found in some aspects of memory in people with Asperger's syndrome do not affect their susceptibility to memory illusions.
11187381		[Neuropsychiatric problems among children are signigicantly underdiagnosed. Intervention programs result in better and less expensive care].	Lakartidningen	2000	A Nydén, M Paananen, C Gillberg		Neuropsychiatric problems (Asperger syndrome, ADHD, reading and writing disorders) affect 6-10 per cent of all children in Sweden. Many of these disorders are never diagnosed. As a consequence, secondary behaviour problems and impaired family relations often follow. A study of 60 families with at least one child affected by one of the above mentioned disorders shows that quality of life can be increased and problems reduced if parents and children are informed of the child's disabilities and the child receives a special education programme. Families who do not receive this special treatment more often apply for medical care from other (more expensive) sources. Quite often do they find this treatment unsatisfactory.
11157556		Dissociation between 'theory of mind' and executive functions in a patient with early left amygdala damage.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2001	C Fine, J Lumsden, R J Blair		There have been recent suggestions that the amygdala may be involved in the development or mediation of 'theory of mind'. We report a patient, B.M., with early or congenital left amygdala damage who, by adulthood, had received the psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia and Asperger's syndrome. We conducted a series of experimental investigations to determine B.M.'s cognitive functioning. In line with his diagnoses, B.M. was found to be severely impaired in his ability to represent mental states. Following this, we conducted a second series of studies to determine B.M.'s executive functioning. In the literature, there have been frequent claims that theory of mind is mediated by general executive functioning. B.M. showed no indication of executive function impairment, passing 16 tests assessing his ability to inhibit dominant responses, create and maintain goal-related behaviours, and temporally sequence behaviour. The findings are discussed with reference to models regarding the role of the amygdala in the development of theory of mind and the degree of dissociation between theory of mind and executive functioning. We conclude that theory of mind is not simply a function of more general executive functions, and that executive functions can develop and function on-line, independently of theory of mind. Moreover, we conclude that the amygdala may play some role in the development of the circuitry mediating theory of mind.
11099122		Local and global processing of music in high-functioning persons with autism: beyond central coherence?	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2000	L Mottron, I Peretz, E Ménard		"A multi-modal abnormality in the integration of parts and whole has been proposed to account for a bias toward local stimuli in individuals with autism (Frith, 1989; Mottron & Belleville, 1993). In the current experiment, we examined the utility of hierarchical models in characterising musical information processing in autistic individuals. Participants were 13 high-functioning individuals with autism and 13 individuals of normal intelligence matched on chronological age, nonverbal IQ, and laterality, and without musical experience. The task consisted of same-different judgements of pairs of melodies. Differential local and global processing was assessed by manipulating the level, local or global, at which modifications occurred. No deficit was found in the two measures of global processing. In contrast, the clinical group performed better than the comparison group in the detection of change in nontransposed, contour-preserved melodies that tap local processing. These findings confirm the existence of a ""local bias"" in music perception in individuals with autism, but challenge the notion that it is accounted for by a deficit in global music processing. The present study suggests that enhanced processing of elementary physical properties of incoming stimuli, as found previously in the visual modality, may also exist in the auditory modality."

Previously, the authors found smaller cingulate volume and decreased metabolism of the cingulate in seven autistic patients. In this study, they measured the volume and glucose metabolism of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus in an expanded group of 17 patients with autism spectrum disorders (autism [N=10] or Asperger's disorder [N=7]) and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.

There are no data, however, on the outcome of children with Asperger's disorder or on whether their outcome differs from that of children with autism. The objectives of this study were to compare the outcome of groups of children with these disorders over a period of 2 years on variables independent of the defining criteria and to identify variables that might account for these differences.

Is the diagnostic validity of the various disorders simply lacking empirical data for full substantiation, or does the overall conceptualization of the category have more fundamental problems, not reflecting the ""true"" nature of the phenomena? This paper argues the latter hypothesis. I review the historical development of the classification of PDD, summarize recent empirical data on issues of reliability and validity, and suggest a new approach to classification and understanding."
11079426		Attributing social meaning to ambiguous visual stimuli in higher-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome: The Social Attribution Task.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2000	A Klin	Yale Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA. Ami.Klin@Yale.Edu	More able individuals with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS) have been shown to pass relatively high level theory of mind (ToM) tasks without displaying commensurate levels of social adaptation in naturalistic settings. This paper presents a social cognitive procedure the Social Attribution Task (SAT) that reduces factors thought to facilitate ToM task performance without facilitating real-life social functioning. Sixty participants with autism (N = 20), AS (N = 20), and normally developing adolescents and adults (N = 20) with normative IQs were asked to provide narratives describing Heider and Simmel's (1944) silent cartoon animation in which geometric shapes enact a social plot. These narratives were coded in terms of the participants' abilities to attribute social meaning to the geometric cartoon. The SAT provides reliable and quantified scores on seven indices of social cognition. Results revealed marked deficits in both clinical groups across all indices. These deficits were not related to verbal IQ or level of metalinguistic skills. Individuals with autism and AS identified about a quarter of the social elements in the story, a third of their attributions were irrelevant to the social plot, and they used pertinent ToM terms very infrequently. They were also unable to derive psychologically based personality features from the shapes' movements. When provided with more explicit verbal information on the nature of the cartoon, individuals with AS improved their performance slightly more than those with autism, but not significantly so.
11063087		Asperger's syndrome, X-linked mental retardation (MRX23), and chronic vocal tic disorder.	Journal of child neurology	2000	E Searcy, L Burd, J Kerbeshian, A Stenehjem, L A Franceschini		Pervasive developmental disorders are severe disorders of development with no consistent neurobiologic etiology and most often an idiopathic etiology. We report a 12-year-old male who met criteria for a pervasive developmental disorder (Asperger's syndrome) and a chronic tic disorder. The child also has an X-linked cognitive impairment (MRX23). The presence of tic symptomatology, pervasive developmental disorder, and fragile X syndrome has previously been reported. Since no singular etiology for Asperger's syndrome has been found, the possibility of other cases of Asperger's syndrome occurring with concurrent abnormalities on the X chromosome should be considered by clinicians, especially if tic symptomatology is present.
11055458		The Awkward Moments Test: a naturalistic measure of social understanding in autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2000	L Heavey, W Phillips, S Baron-Cohen, M Rutter		Details are given of a new advanced theory of mind task, developed to approximate the demands of real-life mentalizing in able individuals with autism. Excerpts of films showing characters in social situations were presented, with participants required to answer questions on characters' mental states and on control, nonsocial questions. When compared with control participants, adults with high-functioning autism and Asperger syndrome were most impaired in their ability to answer the questions requiring mind-reading ability. Although the present findings have implications for task modification, such naturalistic, dynamic stimuli are held to offer an important means of studying subtle difficulties in mentalistic understanding.
11055183		[Pervasive developmental disorders: controversies concerning the classification of autism].	Psychiatria polska	2000	E Pisula	Pracownia Psychologii Rehabilitacyjnej, Wydział Psychologii Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego.	Autistic Disorder was described by Leo Kanner in 1943. Since that time not only the name of this disorder (initially early infantile autism) has changed but also it's relation to other disorders. DSM-IV includes autism together with Rett's Disorder, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Asperger's Disorder and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified into one category: Pervasive Developmental Disorders. The definition and contents of Pervasive Developmental Disorders raise many controversies. Differentiation between particular disorders within this category is also difficult. This paper discusses some of these problems.
11050021		The functional neuroanatomy of social behaviour: changes in cerebral blood flow when people with autistic disorder process facial expressions.	Brain : a journal of neurology	2000	H D Critchley, E M Daly, E T Bullmore, S C Williams, T Van Amelsvoort, D M Robertson, A Rowe, M Phillips, G McAlonan, P Howlin, D G Murphy		Although high-functioning individuals with autistic disorder (i.e. autism and Asperger syndrome) are of normal intelligence, they have life-long abnormalities in social communication and emotional behaviour. However, the biological basis of social difficulties in autism is poorly understood. Facial expressions help shape behaviour, and we investigated if high-functioning people with autistic disorder show neurobiological differences from controls when processing emotional facial expressions. We used functional MRI to investigate brain activity in nine adults with autistic disorder (mean age +/- standard deviation 37 +/- 7 years; IQ 102 +/- 15) and nine controls (27 +/- 7 years; IQ 116 +/- 10) when explicitly (consciously) and implicitly (unconsciously) processing emotional facial expressions. Subjects with autistic disorder differed significantly from controls in the activity of cerebellar, mesolimbic and temporal lobe cortical regions of the brain when processing facial expressions. Notably, they did not activate a cortical 'face area' when explicitly appraising expressions, or the left amygdala region and left cerebellum when implicitly processing emotional facial expressions. High-functioning people with autistic disorder have biological differences from controls when consciously and unconsciously processing facial emotions, and these differences are most likely to be neurodevelopmental in origin. This may account for some of the abnormalities in social behaviour associated with autism.

11039856		Episodic memory and remembering in adults with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2000	D M Bowler, J M Gardiner, S J Grice		A group of adults with Asperger syndrome and an IQ-matched control group were compared in remember versus know recognition memory. Word frequency was also manipulated. Both groups showed superior recognition for low-frequency compared with high-frequency words, and in both groups this word frequency effect occurred in remembering, not in knowing. Nor did overall recognition differ between the two groups. However, recognition in the Asperger group was associated with less remembering, and more knowing, than in the control group. Since remembering reflects autonoetic consciousness, which is the hallmark of an episodic memory system, these results show that episodic memory is moderately impaired in individuals with Asperger syndrome even when overall recognition performance is not.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	2000	J Green, A Gilchrist, D Burton, A Cox		Lack of standardized phenotypic definition has made outcome studies of Asperger syndrome (AS) difficult to interpret. This paper reports psychosocial functioning in 20 male adolescents with AS, defined according to current ICD-10 criteria, and a comparison group of 20 male adolescents with severe conduct disorder. Subjects were gathered from clinical referral. Evaluation used standardized interviewer rated assessments of social functioning and psychiatric morbidity. The AS group showed severe impairments in practical social functioning despite good cognitive ability and lack of significant early language delay. High levels of anxiety and obsessional disorders were found in AS; depression, suicidal ideation, tempers, and defiance in both groups. Results are compared with those from other studies. Relevance to clinical ascertainment and treatment is discussed.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2000	N J Rinehart, J L Bradshaw, S A Moss, A V Brereton, B J Tonge		"This study explored the claim that individuals with autism and Asperger's disorder tend to process locally rather than holistically. Participants observed a large or ""global"" number composed of smaller or ""local"" numbers. The response was contingent upon the identification of either the large stimulus or the small stimuli. Relative to age, sex, and IQ matched controls, global processing in children and adolescents with autism (N = 12) and Asperger's disorder (N = 12) was more vulnerable when the local stimuli were incongruent. The autism group made more global errors than their matched control group, regardless of whether there was local incongruence. In contrast, the Asperger's disorder group made a similar number of global errors as their respective control group. These results were discussed in relation to an ""absence of global precedence"" notion, ""weak central coherence"" theory, and right-hemisphere dysfunction. The neurobiological significance of these findings were discussed in the context of a fronto-striatal model of dysfunction."

"This article considers whether Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA) necessarily leads to disability or whether AS/HFA simply leads to ""difference."" It concludes that the term ""difference"" in relation to AS/ HFA is a more neutral, value-free, and fairer description than terms such as ""impairment,"" ""deficiency,"" or ""disability""; that the term ""disability"" only applies to the lower functioning cases of autism; but that the term ""disability"" may need to be retained for ASIHFA as long as the legal framework provides financial and other support only for individuals with a disability. Two models are summarized which attempt to define in what way individuals with AS/HFA are ""different"": the central coherence model, and the folk psychology-folk physics model. The challenge for research is to test the value of such models and to precisely characterize the differences in cognitive style."

Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids	2000	C Trevarthen	Department of Psychology, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK. c.trevarthen@ed.ac.uk	Colwyn Trevarthen, working on autism, discussed the importance of time, rhythm and temporal processing in brain function. The brains of new born infants show highly coherent and coordinated patterns of activity over time, and their rhythms are remarkably similar to those of adults. Since the cortex has not yet developed, this coordination must be subcortical in origin. The likely source is the emotional motor system. He noted that the cerebellum might regulate the intricate timing of the development and expression of emotional communication. He also pointed out that emotional and motivational factors have often been seriously neglected in psychology (largely owing to a misplaced focus on 'cognition' as some isolated entity) and emphasized the potential importance of empathetic support and music therapy in helping autistic children.

Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids	2000	G S Jones	Woodlands Hospital, Cults, Aberdeen, UK. torfness@btinternet.com	Recognition of the autistic spectrum disorders is becoming more widespread amongst basic scientists, clinicians, and the general population. The term does not imply anything about pathology or aetiology, although it has proved to be a useful concept clinically. From Kanner's classical autism the concept has widened in scope to include milder and more subtle impairments. From a clinical perspective, there are many alternative diagnoses in an individual with autistic-like symptoms, and thorough investigation is necessary to exclude these.
10970708		Red blood cell fatty acid compositions in a patient with autistic spectrum disorder: a characteristic abnormality in neurodevelopmental disorders?	Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids	2000	J G Bell, J R Sargent, D R Tocher, J R Dick		The fatty acid compositions of red blood cell (RBC) phospholipids from a patient with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) had reduced percentages of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFA) compared to control samples. The percentage of HUFA in the RBC from the autistic patient was dramatically reduced (up to 70%) when the sample was stored for 6 weeks at -20 degrees C. However, only minor HUFA reductions were recorded in control samples stored similarly, or when the autistic sample was stored at -80 degrees C. A similar instability in RBC HUFA compositions upon storage at -20 degrees C has been recorded in schizophrenic patients. In a number of other neurodevelopmental conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and dyslexia, reduced concentrations of RBC HUFA have been recorded. The extent and nature of these aberrations require further assessment to determine a possible common biochemical origin of neurodevelopmental disorders in general. To facilitate this, a large scale assessment of RBC fatty acid compositions in patients with ASD, and related disorders, should be performed as a matter of urgency. Supplementing cells in culture with the tryptophan metabolite indole acrylic acid (IAA) affected the levels of cellular HUFA and prostaglandin production. Indole acroyl glycine (IAG), a metabolite of IAA excreted in urine, is found in high concentrations in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD, ADHD, dyslexia, Asperger's syndrome and obsessive compulsive disorder.

Yet, it often remains unrecognized and undiagnosed until or after late preschool age because appropriate tools for routine developmental screening and screening specifically for autism have not been available. Early identification of children with autism and intensive, early intervention during the toddler and preschool years improves outcome for most young children with autism. This practice parameter reviews the available empirical evidence and gives specific recommendations for the identification of children with autism. This approach requires a dual process: 1) routine developmental surveillance and screening specifically for autism to be performed on all children to first identify those at risk for any type of atypical development, and to identify those specifically at risk for autism; and 2) to diagnose and evaluate autism, to differentiate autism from other developmental disorders.
10895561		The external validity of Asperger disorder: lack of evidence from the domain of neuropsychology.	Journal of abnormal psychology	2000	J N Miller, S Ozonoff		"The present study compared individuals with high-functioning autism (HFA) and Asperger disorder (AD) in intellectual, motor, visuospatial, and executive function domains. Participants with AD demonstrated significantly higher Verbal and Full Scale IQ scores, significantly larger Verbal-Performance IQ discrepancies, and significantly better visual-perceptual skills than those with HFA. Once the superior intellectual abilities of the AD group were controlled (both statistically through analysis of covariance and by examining IQ-matched subgroups of HFA and AD participants), no significant group differences in motor, visuospatial, or executive functions were evident, save a marginally significant trend toward poorer fine motor performance in the AD group. This suggests that AD may simply be ""high-IQ autism"" and that separate names for the disorders may not be warranted. The relation of these findings to theories of autism and AD are discussed."

10868783		Occurrence of tics in Asperger's syndrome and autistic disorder.	Journal of child neurology	2000	J M Ringman, J Jankovic		Asperger's syndrome is a condition in the autistic spectrum in which language development is normal. Patients with Asperger's syndrome frequently exhibit repetitive movements (stereotypies), and can have motor and phonic tics in addition to other behavioral abnormalities. We present 12 patients with autistic spectrum disorders who were referred to our Movement Disorders Clinic for evaluation of tics. Eight of the 12 had normal language development and therefore met criteria for Asperger's syndrome. All patients exhibited stereotypic movements; in addition, seven had tics and six of these met diagnostic criteria for Tourette syndrome. Of the six patients with clinical features of both Asperger's syndrome and Tourette syndrome, three had severe congenital sensory deficits. The autistic patients in our series were clinically heterogeneous and though tics were clearly present, other aberrant movements demonstrated by them were harder to classify. Our series confirms the wide range of clinical manifestations in Asperger's syndrome and autism, including tics and other features of Tourette syndrome. Furthermore, it suggests that sensory deprivation contributes to the development of adventitious movements in this population.

10808042		Increased growth hormone response to sumatriptan challenge in adult autistic disorders.	Psychiatry research	2000	S Novotny, E Hollander, A Allen, S Mosovich, B Aronowitz, C Cartwright, C DeCaria, R Dolgoff-Kaspar		Serotonergic (5-HT) abnormalities have been documented in autism. To assess sensitivity of the 5-HT1d receptor, growth hormone response to the 5-HT1d receptor agonist sumatriptan was studied in adult autistic patients and matched normal controls. In this study, 11 adult patients with autism or Asperger's disorder were compared with nine matched controls. All subjects were randomized to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges, separated by a 1-week interval, and growth hormone was measured before and during the challenges. The results showed a highly significant diagnosisxdrugxtime interaction on repeated measure analysis covaried for baseline. This suggests that autistic patients had significantly greater growth hormone response to sumatriptan than normal controls, independent of placebo effects. Therefore, abnormalities in 5-HT regulation in autism may be related to increased sensitivity of the 5-HT1d inhibitory receptor in autism.

10799629		Counseling parents regarding prognosis in autistic spectrum disorder.	Pediatrics	2000	J Coplan	Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Children's Seashore House of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4388, USA. coplan@email.chop.edu	A triaxial model for autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) is presented, incorporating age, degree of intelligence, and severity of autistic features. As the name implies, ASD can vary in degree of expression from minimal to profound. Furthermore, the symptoms of ASD change in predictable ways with the passage of time. For example, echolalia during early childhood may be replaced by verbal literalism and difficulty with verbal humor during later childhood or adolescence. The prognosis for children with ASD is governed by the joint impact of the degree of expression of ASD and the degree of developmental delay, if any. All combinations of ASD and intellect are possible (ie, severe ASD plus severe mental retardation, severe ASD plus normal general intelligence, and so forth). The relationship among these 3 parameters-severity of ASD, level of general intelligence, and change in symptom expression over time, is represented schematically as a 3-dimensional graph. The utility of this graph as a counseling tool, and as the basis for future research on the prognosis of ASD are discussed.

10789283		'Obsessions' in children with autism or Asperger syndrome. Content analysis in terms of core domains of cognition.	The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science	1999	S Baron-Cohen, S Wheelwright		We report a survey of the content of obsessions in children with autism spectrum conditions. We use the term 'obsessions' narrowly, to indicate strong, repetitive interests. We predicted that obsessions would not cluster randomly, but rather would occur significantly more often in the domain of 'folk physics' (an interest in how things work), and significantly less often in the domain of 'folk psychology' (an interest in how people work). These predictions were tested relative to a control group of 33 children with Tourette syndrome.

10784084		Verbal bias in recognition of facial emotions in children with Asperger syndrome.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	2000	J B Grossman, A Klin, A S Carter, F R Volkmar		Thirteen children and adolescents with diagnoses of Asperger syndrome (AS) were matched with 13 nonautistic control children on chronological age and verbal IQ. They were tested on their ability to recognize simple facial emotions, as well as facial emotions paired with matching, mismatching, or irrelevant verbal labels. There were no differences between the groups at recognizing simple emotions but the Asperger group performed significantly worse than the control group at recognizing emotions when faces were paired with mismatching words (but not with matching or irrelevant words). The results suggest that there are qualitative differences from nonclinical populations in how children with AS process facial expressions. When presented with a more demanding affective processing task, individuals with AS showed a bias towards visual-verbal over visual-affective information (i.e., words over faces). Thus, children with AS may be utilizing compensatory strategies, such as verbal mediation, to process facial expressions of emotion.
10778500		[Language in autistic disorders].	Revista de neurologia	1999	J Artigas	Unidad de Neuropediatría, Hospital de Sabadell, Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí, Barcelona, España. josepart@valser.es; jartigas@cspt.es	Autism is a developmental disorder affecting social relationships, communication and flexibility of thought. These three basic aspects of autism may present in many different forms and degrees. Therefore autism should be considered to be a spectrum of autistic disorders rather than a single strictly defined condition. The spectrum of autistic disorders extends from intelligent individuals with acceptable social integration, to severely retarded patients with scarcely any social interaction. Language is almost always affected either in its formal aspects or in its usage. Autistic linguistic disorders form a specific language disorder (developmental dysphasia) and a pragmatic disorder linked both to the primary language problem and to the social cognitive deficit. We discuss the different linguistic syndromes observed in autistic patients with special emphasis on the semantic-pragmatic disorder.

Therefore, it is of considerable interest that individuals with autism and related conditions have selective deficits in face recognition (sparing nonface object recognition).
23605419	doi: 10.1007/BF02942985	Study on biodegradation of some A- and B-trichothecenes and ochratoxin A by use of probiotic microorganisms.	Mycotoxin research	2000	J Böhm, J Grajewski, H Asperger, B Cecon, B Rabus, E Razzazi		In vitro biodegradation experiments were done using some probiotic microorganisms. DifferentSaccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacilli andBacilli strains were tested for their ability to degrade Nivalenol (NIV), Deoxynivalenol (DON), Diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), T2-Toxin and Ochratoxin A (OTA). The concentrations of selected mycotoxins were in the range of natural occurring toxin contaminations (1ppm for NIV and DON, 500ppb for DAS and T-2 and 50ppb for OTA). No alteration of concentrations could be registered for the tested trichothecenes. The best results could be achieved in experiments with OTA by up to 94% detoxification. Influence of toxins on colony forming unit of all tested microorganisms were recorded. Especially T-2 toxin and DAS have a slowing effect on growth of some strains.
10695900		Venlafaxine in children, adolescents, and young adults with autism spectrum disorders: an open retrospective clinical report.	Journal of child neurology	2000	E Hollander, A Kaplan, C Cartwright, D Reichman		Autism is characterized by social deficits, communication and language impairments, narrow restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, inattention, and hyperactivity. While selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in treating core symptoms of autism, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). An open, retrospective clinical study with venlafaxine evaluated its effect on core symptoms of autism as well as associated features of ADHD. Ten consecutive subjects meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), criteria for an autism spectrum disorder were treated with venlafaxine, initiated at 12.5 mg per day and adjusted on a flexible basis. Six of 10 completers were judged to be sustained treatment responders, by scoring 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the Clinical Global Impressions improvement scale. Venlafaxine was effective in low dosages (mean, 24.37 mg/day; range, 6.25 to 50 mg/day) and was well tolerated. Improvement was noted in repetitive behaviors and restricted interests, social deficits, communication and language function, inattention, and hyperactivity. Controlled treatment trials with venlafaxine are warranted in autism spectrum disorders.
10683843		A laboratory study of sleep in Asperger's syndrome.	Neuroreport	2000	R Godbout, C Bergeron, E Limoges, E Stip, L Mottron		Asperger's syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder that may fall along the autistic spectrum. We compared the sleep of eight patients with AS with that of participants matched for age and gender. Patients with AS showed decreased sleep time in the first two-thirds of the night, increased number of shifts into REM sleep from a waking epoch, and all but one patient showed signs of REM sleep disruption. EEG sleep spindles were significantly decreased while K complexes and REM sleep rapid eye movements were normal. Three patients with AS, but none of the comparison participants, showed a pathological index of periodic leg movements in sleep. These observations show that sleep disorders are associated with AS and suggest that defective sleep control systems may be associated with the clinical picture of AS.

10654125		Further evidence for a low body weight in male children and adolescents with Asperger's disorder.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	1999	E Sobanski, A Marcus, K Hennighausen, J Hebebrand, M H Schmidt		The study explores the common clinical impression and previously reported finding by Hebebrand et al. (7) of reduced body weight in male children and adolescents with Asperger's disorder (AD). Body weight and height of 36 consecutively admitted male patients with AD were retrospectively assessed for the calculation of body mass indices (BMI, kg/m2). The BMIs were transformed to percentile ranks and plotted into BMI-centiles representative for the German population. In addition, comorbid psychopathology was assessed to explore a possible relationship between associated psychopathology and body weight. The mean BMI-centile of all patients was 34.7 +/- 31.8 and, thus, differed significantly from the mean centile of an age- and gender-matched psychiatric control group, which was 52.7 +/- 28.3. Thirteen patients had a BMI below the 10th centile and five even below the third. Three of the latter presented with disturbed eating behaviour. Altogether four patients showed disturbed eating behaviour. They had a significantly lower mean BMI-centile than the rest of the group. The BMI-centiles of patients with other additional psychopathology did not differ significantly from the mean percentile of the whole cohort. The results clearly show an increased risk for underweight and disturbed eating behaviour in patients with Asperger's disorder which should be evaluated in further studies.
10649829		The relationship between repetitive behaviors and growth hormone response to sumatriptan challenge in adult autistic disorder.	Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology	2000	E Hollander, S Novotny, A Allen, B Aronowitz, C Cartwright, C DeCaria		Autism is heterogeneous with respect to clinical symptoms and etiology. To sort out this heterogeneity in autism, we investigated whether specific neurobiological markers vary in parallel to core symptomatology. Specifically, we assessed growth hormone response to the 5-HT 1d agonist, sumatriptan, and linked this measure of serotonergic function to the severity of repetitive behaviors in adult autistic patients. Eleven adult patients with autism or Asperger's disorder were randomized to single dose sumatriptan (6 mg SQ) and placebo challenges, separated by a one-week interval. In adult autistic disorders, severity of repetitive behaviors at baseline, as measured by YBOCS-compulsion score, significantly positively correlated with both peak delta growth hormone response and area under the curve growth hormone response to sumatriptan. Thus, the severity of a specific behavioral dimension in autism (repetitive behaviors) parallels the sensitivity of the 5-HT 1d receptor, as manifest by sumatriptan elicited GH response.
10638459		The screening and diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1999	P A Filipek, P J Accardo, G T Baranek, E H Cook, G Dawson, B Gordon, J S Gravel, C P Johnson, R J Kallen, S E Levy, N J Minshew, S Ozonoff, B M Prizant, I Rapin, S J Rogers, W L Stone, S Teplin, R F Tuchman, F R Volkmar		The Child Neurology Society and American Academy of Neurology recently proposed to formulate Practice Parameters for the Diagnosis and Evaluation of Autism for their memberships. This endeavor was expanded to include representatives from nine professional organizations and four parent organizations, with liaisons from the National Institutes of Health. This document was written by this multidisciplinary Consensus Panel after systematic analysis of over 2,500 relevant scientific articles in the literature. The Panel concluded that appropriate diagnosis of autism requires a dual-level approach: (a) routine developmental surveillance, and (b) diagnosis and evaluation of autism. Specific detailed recommendations for each level have been established in this document, which are intended to improve the rate of early suspicion and diagnosis of, and therefore early intervention for, autism.
10619627		Normal movement reading in Asperger subjects.	Neuroreport	1999	S Avikainen, T Kulomäki, R Hari		Patients with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS) are impaired in mindreading and imitation skills. One possibility would be that their 'mirror neuron' system, which matches action execution and observation, does not function properly. To test this hypothesis we compared action-viewing related motor cortex functions in an AS group (one autistic and four AS subjects) and eight control subjects. In both groups viewing hand actions modified the neuromagnetic approximately 20 Hz oscillatory activity in the primary motor cortex to the same extent. Thus impaired mindreading and imitation skills found in AS and autism do not seem to result from dysfunction of the motor cortex part of the action execution/observation system.
10619282		The diagnosis of autism and Asperger syndrome: findings from a survey of 770 families.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	1999	P Howlin, A Asgharian		As part of a wider survey of parents of children with autistic spectrum disorders in the UK, the diagnostic experiences of 614 parents of children with autism and 156 with Asperger syndrome were compared. Although the ages of the children in the two groups were very similar at the time of the survey, parents of children given a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome had experienced significantly longer delays and greater frustration in obtaining a diagnosis than those with a child with autism. In the 'autism group' the average age when diagnosis was confirmed was around 5.5 years; in the 'Asperger group' it was 11 years. Parents of children with a diagnosis of autism were generally aware of problems in their child's development by 18 months of age; in the Asperger group concerns emerged later, at around 30 months of age. Initial worries in both groups centred around abnormal social development but parents of children with Asperger syndrome were less likely to have noted communication problems. Stereotyped or repetitive behaviours were not prominent in the early years in either group. Despite the problems inherent in data collected by postal survey, many of the findings of this study are supported by other research. The practical implications of delayed diagnosis, especially in the case of more able children with Asperger syndrome are discussed.

21407912		Did field marshal bernard montgomery (montgomery of alamein) have asperger's syndrome?	Indian journal of psychiatry	2000	M Fitzgerald	Henry Marsh Professor of Child Psychiatry, Trinity College Dublin, Child & Family Centre, Ballyfermot Road, Ballyfermot, Dublin 10, Ireland.	In the present paper the evidence for Field Marshal Montgomery having Asperger's syndrome is examined. Biographies of Montgomery were examined to search for evidence that he met criteria for Asperger's syndrome - Gillberg (1991) and Asperger's disorder (APA.1994) and Anankastic personality disorder (WHO,1992). He demonstrates a qualitative impairment in social interaction and restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behaviour, interests and activities. It can be concluded that he met criteria for Asperger's disorder DSM-IV (APA.1994).
10604406		Are individuals with autism and Asperger's syndrome susceptible to visual illusions?	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1999	D Ropar, P Mitchell		"A recent finding that individuals with autism are not susceptible to illusions has been explained by Happé (1996) as a sign of ""weak central coherence"" at lower levels of processing. We investigated the phenomenon with a more sophisticated measure. In Experiment 1, individuals with autism, Asperger's syndrome, moderate learning difficulties, and typical development adjusted certain comparison lines and circles to make them appear to be the same size in four visual illusions. With a minor exception, the participants with autism and Asperger's syndrome evinced a systematic bias in their judgements in the illusion condition. The extent of this was no different from control participants. In a second experiment, a similar finding was obtained in a task where participants made verbal judgements about the stimuli. The results suggest that lower-level coherence in visual processing in autism is intact."
10587887		Recognition of faux pas by normally developing children and children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1999	S Baron-Cohen, M O'Riordan, V Stone, R Jones, K Plaisted		Most theory of mind (ToM) tests are designed for subjects with a mental age of 4-6 years. There are very few ToM tests for subjects who are older or more able than this. We report a new test of ToM, designed for children 7-11 years old. The task involves recognizing faux pas. Study 1 tested 7-9, and 11-year-old normal children. Results showed that the ability to detect faux pas developed with age and that there was a differential developmental profile between the two sexes (female superiority). Study 2 tested children with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA), selected for being able to pass traditional 4- to 6-year level (first- and second-order) false belief tests. Results showed that whereas normal 9- to 11-year-old children were skilled at detecting faux pas, children with AS or HFA were impaired on this task. Study 3 reports a refinement in the test, employing control stimuli. This replicated the results from Study 2. Some patients with AS or HFA were able to recognize faux pas but still produced them. Future research should assess faux pas production.
10587886		The Strange Stories Test: a replication with high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1999	T Jolliffe, S Baron-Cohen		Two groups of individuals, one with high-functioning autism and the other with Asperger syndrome were tested using Happé's Strange Stories Test of a more advanced theory of mind (Happé, 1994). This assesses the ability to interpret a nonliteral statement. Relative to normal controls who were IQ and age-matched, individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome performed less well on the task, while performing normally on a non-mentalistic control task. Individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome could provide mental state answers, but had difficulty in providing contextually appropriate mental state answers. Rather, their answers tended to concentrate on the utterance in isolation. This replicates Happé's result. Although the majority of both clinical groups provided context-inappropriate interpretations, the autism group had the greater difficulty. Results are discussed in relation to both weak central coherence and theory of mind.
10550700		Autistic spectrum disorders in childhood epilepsy surgery candidates.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	1999	D C Taylor, B G Neville, J H Cross		"One third of children with autistic spectrum disorders (or pervasive developmental disorders) enter that state by regression from a more normal prior development at the onset of epilepsy or epileptiform abnormality in the electroencephalogram. In a very small proportion structural lesions of the temporal lobes are discovered. These form part of the sample of children coming to a surgical treatment programme. Ninety-eight child candidates for epilepsy surgery were seen by one neuropsychiatrist. Their psychiatric diagnoses were coded on DSM IV schedules. Other variables of interest were the age at onset of epilepsy; the nature, the side, and time of acquisition of the lesion; intelligence, and sex. There were 19 children with autistic spectrum disorders including eight with Asperger's syndrome. Ten of the children in the autistic group had right brain lesions; six were dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNETs); two were cortical dysplasias; one tuberous sclerosis; one hemi-cortical defect; and 1 mesial temporal sclerosis. Nine started epilepsy in their first year; nine had IQs in the retarded range; nine of the 11 were male. Six of eight Asperger's children had right brain lesions; two DNETs; four mesial temporal sclerosis; one Rasmussen encephalitis. Four started epilepsy in their first year; one was retarded; five were female. Children who had no, or other, psychiatric disorder also showed ""mass"" lesions, or temporal sclerosis but with different biases as to side, sex, and very early onset of epilepsy from the autistic spectrum group. Very early onset of epilepsy, with lesions of embryonal origin, in the right temporal lobe, strongly predisposed males towards autistic regression. Such patients should be referred very early for consideration of urgent surgical treatment."
10536083		Spatial working memory in Asperger's syndrome and in patients with focal frontal and temporal lobe lesions.	Brain and cognition	1999	R G Morris, A Rowe, N Fox, J D Feigenbaum, E C Miotto, P Howlin		Spatial working memory (SWM) was investigated in 15 patients with Asperger's syndrome (AS) comparing their performance to 18 age- and IQ-matched control subjects. An additional comparison was made with 20 unilateral frontal excision patients [9 right (RFL); 11 left (LFL)] and with 38 unilateral temporal lobectomy patients [18 right (RTL); 18 left (LTL)], the frontal and temporal lobe patients having separate matched control groups. SWM was tested using the Executive Golf Task, a test that also measures spatial strategy formation. The AS group showed a substantial deficit on SWM, but no impairment in strategy formation. The LFL showed the same pattern of impairment, but with a less substantial deficit. The RFL group showed a large deficit, but some of this was accounted for by a strategy formation impairment. Of the temporal lobe lesions groups, only the RTL group was impaired on SWM, but this group showed normal strategy formation. It was concluded that the SWM deficit in AS may reflect a more general difficulty in accessing different types of representations in order to guide voluntary behavior, providing at least a partial explanation for the executive deficits found in AS.

10478731		Creativity and imagination in autism and Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1999	J Craig, S Baron-Cohen		Three studies are reported that address the often described impoverished creativity in autism. Using the Torrance Creativity Tests, Experiment 1 found that children with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS) showed impairments. Experiment 2 tested two explanations of these results: the executive dysfunction and the imagination deficit hypotheses. Results supported both hypotheses. Children with autism and AS could generate possible novel changes to an object, though they generated fewer of these relative to controls. Furthermore, these were all reality-based, rather than imaginative. Experiment 3 extended this using a test of imaginative fluency. Children with autism and AS generated fewer suggestions involving attribution of animacy to foam shapes, compared to controls, instead generating reality-based suggestions of what the shapes could be. Although this is evidence of executive dysfunction, it does not directly account for why imaginative creativity is more difficult than reality-based creativity.
10465861		A possible tetracycline-risperidone-sertraline interaction in an adolescent.	The Canadian journal of clinical pharmacology = Journal canadien de pharmacologie clinique	1999	M Steele, J Couturier		A 15-year-old adolescent male, with Asperger's disorder, Tourette's disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, on a tetracycline-risperidone-sertraline treatment regimen, had an acute exacerbation of motor and vocal tics. The increase in tics may have resulted from either a tetracycline-risperidone interaction leading to decreased levels of risperidone, or a tetracycline-sertraline interaction leading to increased levels of sertraline or the natural course of the Tourette's disorder. The sertraline dose was increased with no concomitant increase in tics, and subsequent discontinuation of tetracycline resulted in an improvement in tics, which indicates an interaction between tetracycline and risperidone. The addition of antibiotics to psychotropic medications requires close monitoring due to the potential interactions.

10444907		A test of central coherence theory: linguistic processing in high-functioning adults with autism or Asperger syndrome: is local coherence impaired?	Cognition	1999	T Jolliffe, S Baron-Cohen		Central coherence theory (Frith, U., 1989. Autism: Explaining the Enigma. Blackwell, Oxford.) is addressed by exploring linguistic processing in normally intelligent adults with either autism or Asperger syndrome, to test whether local coherence is impaired. Local coherence is the ability to make contextually meaningful connections between linguistic information in short-term or working memory. Experiment 1 demonstrated that individuals with an autism spectrum condition were less likely to use the sentence context spontaneously to provide the context-appropriate pronunciation of a homograph. Experiment 2 presented scenarios which had a situation and outcome which only cohered if a bridging inference was drawn. The clinical groups were less likely to select the most coherent (bridging) inference from competing alternatives. Experiment 3 demonstrated that individuals with an autism spectrum condition were less able to use context to interpret an auditorily presented ambiguous sentence. The findings from Experiments 2 and 3 suggest that individuals with autism or Asperger syndrome have a difficulty in achieving local coherence, while the evidence from Experiment 1 suggests a preference not to strive for coherence. Taken together, these results suggest that individuals with an autism spectrum condition are impaired in achieving local coherence, and they have a preference not to strive for coherence unless instructed to do so, or unless they make a conscious decision to do so. Moreover, the three experiments correlate with one another, which suggests that central coherence may be a unitary force in these different tasks. Of the two clinical groups, the autism group had the greater difficulty in achieving coherence. Possible explanations for the clinical groups' difficulty are explored.
10433406		Autism spectrum disorders at 20 and 42 months of age: stability of clinical and ADI-R diagnosis.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1999	A Cox, K Klein, T Charman, G Baird, S Baron-Cohen, J Swettenham, A Drew, S Wheelwright		The association between, and stability of, clinical diagnosis and diagnosis derived from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R; Lord, Rutter, & Le Couteur, 1994) was examined in a sample of prospectively identified children with childhood autism and other pervasive developmental disorders assessed at the age of 20 months and 42 months. Clinical diagnosis of autism was stable, with all children diagnosed with childhood autism at age 20 months receiving a diagnosis of childhood autism or a related pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) at age 42 months. Clinical diagnosis of childhood autism was also reasonably sensitive, with all children who went on to receive a clinical diagnosis of childhood autism at 42 months being identified as having autism or PDD at 20 months. However, clinical diagnosis for PDD and Asperger's syndrome lacked sensitivity at 20 months, with several children who subsequently received these diagnoses at 42 months receiving diagnoses of language disorder or general developmental delay, as well as in two cases being considered clinically normal, at the earlier timepoint. The ADI-R was found to have good specificity but poor sensitivity at detecting childhood autism at 20 months; however, the stability of diagnosis from 20 to 42 months was good. In addition, the ADI-R at age 20 months was not sensitive to the detection of related PDDs or Asperger's syndrome. The continuity and discontinuity between behavioural abnormalities identified at both timepoints in the three domains of impairment in autism was examined, both in children who met final clinical criteria for an autistic spectrum disorder, and for children with language disorder who did not, as well as for a small sample of typically developing children.

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1999	S Ehlers, C Gillberg, L Wing		The high-functioning Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ) is a 27-item checklist for completion by lay informants when assessing symptoms characteristic of Asperger syndrome and other high-functioning autism spectrum disorders in children and adolescents with normal intelligence or mild mental retardation. Data for parent and teacher ratings in a clinical sample are presented along with various measures of reliability and validity. Optimal cutoff scores were estimated, using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis. Findings indicate that the ASSQ is a useful brief screening device for the identification of autism spectrum disorders in clinical settings.

The European journal of neuroscience	1999	S Baron-Cohen, H A Ring, S Wheelwright, E T Bullmore, M J Brammer, A Simmons, S C Williams		There is increasing support for the existence of 'social intelligence' [Humphrey (1984) Consciousness Regained], independent of general intelligence. Brothers et al. 1990) J. Cog. Neurosci., 4, 107-118] proposed a network of neural regions that comprise the 'social brain': the orbito-frontal cortex (OFC), superior temporal gyrus (STG) and amygdala. We tested Brothers' theory by examining both normal subjects as well as patients with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome (AS), who are well known to have deficits in social intelligence, and perhaps deficits in amygdala function [Bauman & Kemper (1988) J. Neuropath. Exp. Neurol., 47, 369]. We used a test of judging from the expressions of another person's eyes what that other person might be thinking or feeling. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we confirmed Brothers' prediction that the STG and amygdala show increased activation when using social intelligence. Some areas of the prefrontal cortex also showed activation. In contrast, patients with autism or AS activated the fronto-temporal regions but not the amygdala when making mentalistic inferences from the eyes. These results provide support for the social brain theory of normal function, and the amygdala theory of autism.
10322476		Asperger syndrome: a simple matter of white matter?	Trends in cognitive sciences	1999	HD Ellis, HL Gunter		Asperger syndrome, one of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders, is formally diagnosed on the basis of a cluster of cognitive, social and motor signs. It is also associated with poor visuo-spatial skills, good verbal performance, gauche social behaviour and clumsiness. Many of the difficulties evident in those with Asperger syndrome are closely associated with right-hemisphere dysfunction. In this respect they also resemble signs used to diagnose what has been labelled Nonverbal Learning Disorder. Here, these are treated as being the same or closely-related disorders with a possible common underlying aetiology; that is, a neurodevelopmental abnormality affecting white matter. This review examines the ability of this approach to account for a wide range of characteristics of the Asperger syndrome, and contrasts this with a theory-of-mind approach, which, although able to account for the primary features of Asperger syndrome, is less successful at explaining some of its secondary features.
10226747		Autism and the pervasive developmental disorders.	Current opinion in neurology	1999	T Charman	Behavioural Sciences Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, UK. t.charman@ich.ucl.ac.uk	Our understanding of childhood autism and the related pervasive developmental disorders continues to advance in many areas. Nevertheless, the heterogeneity of phenotypic expression presents many challenges, not least to efforts to ascertain the prevalence of the disorders. There is now wide agreement on, and reliable application of, the diagnostic criteria for childhood autism, but there is less agreement on and less reliable application of the criteria for the related disorders atypical autism, pervasive developmental disorder-unspecified and Asperger's syndrome. Evidence about genetic associations indicates that several genes are involved in creating susceptibility to the disorder, and the first steps to identify susceptibility loci have begun. Neuroanatomical models have yet to receive consistent support but early signs of promising advances have been made in pharmacological interventions, and adequate evaluation of behavioural intervention programmes is now underway.
10210247		Comorbidity of autistic spectrum disorders in children with Down syndrome.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	1999	L Kent, J Evans, M Paul, M Sharp		The aim of the study was to identify the comorbidity of autistic spectrum disorders in a population of children with Down syndrome (DS). All children with DS within a defined population of South Birmingham were identified. The Asperger Syndrome Screening Questionnaire and the Child Autism Rating Scale were completed and diagnosis made according to ICD-10 criteria following interview and observation. Thirty-three of 58 identified children completed the measures, four of whom received a diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder. This is equivalent to a minimum comorbid rate of 7%. The questionnaire items concerning social withdrawal, restricted or repetitive interests, clumsiness, and unusual eye contact were associated with an autistic disorder. Of the remaining 29 participating children, 11 also displayed marked obsessional and ritualistic behaviours. The comorbid occurrence of autism and DS is at least 7%. It is important that these children are identified and receive appropriate education and support. A full assessment of social, language, and communication skills and behaviour is crucial, particularly in children with DS who appear different from other children with DS. Potential mechanisms accounting for this comorbidity are discussed.

The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences	1998	Y Kohn, T Fahum, G Ratzoni, A Apter		"Asperger's Syndrome is one of the diagnostic subcategories of pervasive developmental disorders. It is characterized by a defect in reciprocal social interaction, lack of empathy for others and poor non-verbal communication. Antisocial acts, including aggression and sexual offense, are not considered to be common in this disorder. We describe an adolescent with Asperger's Syndrome whose main problems are his violence and sexual offenses. We assume that these symptoms are secondary to his diagnosis of Asperger's as a manifestation of his difficulties with the ""theory of mind"" of others. This atypical case report is in contrast with the low prevalence of aggression and sexual offense in Asperger's, as reported in the literature. We discuss the reasons for this low prevalence. Our conclusions are based on one case history and a literature review. We call for further research in this field."

Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1998	R Eisenmajer, M Prior, S Leekam, L Wing, B Ong, J Gould, M Welham		DSM-IV states that Asperger Disorder may be distinguished from Autistic Disorder by a lack of a delay in early language development. The aim of this study was to establish whether the presence or absence of early language delay would predict autistic symptomatology in children diagnosed with a PDD/autism spectrum disorder. Forty-six language-delayed and 62 normal language onset individuals (M age 11 years) were compared on ICD-10 research criteria and DSM-IV criteria, receptive language, and developmental history variables. Retrospective data were also obtained to determine whether language onset predicted autism symptomatology when young (< 6 years). We found that early language delay predicts more autistic symptomatology when young, but not at an older age. Early language delay is also associated with developmental motor milestone delays and lower receptive language abilities. The results question the use of early language delay as a valid discriminating variable between PDD subgroups.

9885399		A case of Asperger's syndrome first diagnosed in adulthood.	Psychopathology	1999	B Bankier, G Lenz, K Gutierrez, M Bach, H Katschnig		A 25-year-old white male patient was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry, Division of Social Psychiatry, of the University of Vienna, Austria, for severe social withdrawal, selective mutism and outbursts of violence with attacks on his mother. Careful examination revealed the presence of all the typical symptoms of Asperger's syndrome. The diagnosis had never been made before, although the patient had a history of a difficult childhood with several admissions to a child psychiatric inpatient unit for 'obsessional neurosis' and an institutional career. It is stressed that, in view of the availability of treatments and the deleterious effect of the untreated condition in the sensitive years of personality development, early recognition and diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome are of utmost importance.
9813781		Nosological and genetic aspects of Asperger syndrome.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1998	F R Volkmar, A Klin, D Pauls		The validity of Asperger syndrome (i.e., apart from high-functioning autism) continues to be the topic of considerable debate. Consistent with Asperger's original description of the condition there appear to be some important potential differences from autism if both conditions are strictly defined. Although the importance of genetic factors in the transmission of autism is increasingly clear it also appears that genetic factors may play an even more important role in Asperger syndrome (AS). The nosological validity of this condition and its relation to the various PDD spectrum disorder remains an important topic for future research. Well-designed and carefully controlled studies are needed in which patterns of comorbidity and associated problems in family members can be carefully assessed. Such studies will contribute to our understanding of the relationship of AS and autism and may clarify important genetic mechanisms of relevance to autism.

We tested patients with bilateral damage to orbito-frontal cortex (n = 5) and unilateral damage in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 5) on a series of theory of mind tasks varying in difficulty. Bilateral orbito-frontal lesion patients performed similarly to individuals with Asperger""s syndrome, performing well on simpler tests and showing deficits on tasks requiring more subtle social reasoning, such as the ability to recognize a faux pas. In contrast, no specific theory of mind deficits were evident in the unilateral dorsolateral frontal lesion patients. The dorsolateral lesion patients had difficulty only on versions of the tasks that placed demands on working memory."
9786442		Comorbidity of Asperger syndrome: a preliminary report.	Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	1998	M Ghaziuddin, E Weidmer-Mikhail, N Ghaziuddin		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by autistic social dysfunction and idiosyncratic interests in the presence of normal intelligence. There is no history of language delay. Although people with AS are known to suffer from comorbid psychiatric conditions, few studies have systematically addressed this topic. This preliminary report describes the occurrence of psychiatric disorders in a series of patients with AS diagnosed according to the ICD-10/DSM-IV criteria. Out of 35 patients (29 males and six females; mean age 15.1 years; mean verbal IQ 105.9; mean performance IQ 97.5; mean full-scale IQ 102.7), 23 patients (65%) presented with symptoms of an additional psychiatric disorder at the time of evaluation or during the 2-year follow-up. Children were most likely to suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, while depression was the most common diagnosis in adolescents and adults. The implications of these findings are discussed.
9775958		[Diagnostic criteria of autism and Asperger's syndrome: similarities and differences].	Sante mentale au Quebec	1998	N Poirier, J Forget		The American Psychiatric Association's last version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV; APA, 1994) identifies within pervasive developmental disorders five subgroups: (a) autistic disorder; (b) Rett's disorder; (c) childhood disintegrative disorder; (d) Asperger's disorder's and (e) pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. However, the diagnosis of the different sub-groups is difficult to establish, particularly between autistic disorder and Asperger's disorder. This article exposes the diagnostic criteria of autism and Asperger's syndrome in order to illustrate the similarities and differences between the two disorders.
9775956		[Diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation and its impact on obtaining social and educational services in Quebec].	Sante mentale au Quebec	1998	L Mottron, P Lapointe, F Fournier		Pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation is a new clinical category including high-functioning autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder non otherwise specified. Its recognition is recent and still problematic in many regards. This article reviews the historical, theoretical and clinical relations between pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation and bordering disorders. The consequences of an inadequate diagnosis on measures of assistance for these patients is also investigated. The authors conclude on the necessity in considering, independently of the diagnosis, the description of symptoms, the intellectual level and the adaptative level in order to take the most appropriate educational and psychosocial decisions regarding pervasive developmental disorders without mental retardation.
9758197		Are there subgroups within the autistic spectrum? A cluster analysis of a group of children with autistic spectrum disorders.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1998	M Prior, R Eisenmajer, S Leekam, L Wing, J Gould, B Ong, D Dowe		Comprehensive data on the developmental history and current behaviours of a large sample of high-functioning individuals with diagnoses of autism, Asperger's syndrome, or other related disorder were collected via parent interviews. This provided the basis for a taxonomic analysis to search for subgroups. Most participants also completed theory of mind tasks. Three clusters or subgroups were obtained; these differed on theory of mind performance and on verbal abilities. Although subgroups were identified which bore some relationship to clinical differentiation of autistic, Asperger syndrome, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) cases, the nature of the differences between them appeared strongly related to ability variables. Examination of the kinds of behaviours that differentiated the groups suggested that a spectrum of autistic disorders on which children differ primarily in term of degrees of social and cognitive impairments could explain the findings.
9738717		Absence of the fragile X CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion in girls diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder.	The Journal of pediatrics	1998	G A Meyer, N J Blum, W Hitchcock, P Fortina		The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of the fragile X (FRAX) CGG trinucleotide expansion in a population of young girls (n = 45) diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD). Their mean age was 43.7 months (range, 25 to 132 months). Diagnoses included autistic disorder (n = 20), PDD (n = 23), and Asperger's syndrome (n = 2). Molecular FRAX testing was performed on all patients by using the Southern gene blot technique. Genomic DNA was digested with both EcoRI and EagI, fractionated on agarose gel, and blotted and probed with the radiolabeled StB12.3 FMR-1 probe. None of the subjects were found to have an expansion of CGG in either the 2.8 kb or 5.2 kb fragments. A 95% CI, for the prevalence of the FRAX mutation in female subjects with PDD, has an upper bound of 2.9%. We conclude that the prevalence of FRAX positivity in girls with PDD is lower than previously reported. This raises the question of whether any association between FRAX and PDD in female subjects is specific to PDD or is related rather to the presence of mental retardation.

Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1998	K Ziatas, K Durkin, C Pratt		This study examined the relationship between the development of theory of mind and the development of the belief terms think, know, and guess. Children with autism and Asperger syndrome, matched to children with specific language impairment and normal development, completed false belief, belief term comprehension, and belief term expression tasks. The autistic group's performance on the false belief, belief term comprehension, and belief term expression tasks was significantly poorer than that of the Asperger, language impaired, and normal groups. Across groups an association was found between false belief and belief term performance. Results support a growing body of literature demonstrating links between the development of theory of mind and communicative competence.

In the last twenty years, especially externe quality assurance was very important. Pioneers of this development were Schega and Scheibe and the East German working group for quality assurance in surgery. After preparations of Scheibe in some federal countries, global measures could be started. In 1993, also in Sachsen-Anhalt we started externe quality assurance in surgery with the diagnosis gallstone disease and cholecystitis. The experiences and results of a 3-year period will be shown.
9673217		A study of idiom comprehension in children with semantic-pragmatic difficulties. Part II: Between-groups results and discussion.	International journal of language & communication disorders	1998	D Kerbel, P Grunwell		Using a play-based methodology and a symptom checklist, this study investigated idiom comprehension in 26 children aged between 6-11 who were considered to have semantic-pragmatic difficulties. This group was compared with two groups of mainstream children and a group of children with (other) language disorders not primarily of a semantic or pragmatic nature. The results indicate that the children with semantic-pragmatic difficulties did, as a group, demonstrate significantly fewer appropriate idiomatic interpretations and significantly more inappropriate interpretations than did any of the other three groups. However, the higher level of inappropriate scores in the semantic-pragmatic difficulties group reflected a large number of 'fuzzy' actions rather than significantly higher rates of literality. This may indicate an awareness among these children that the literal meaning is inappropriate in the absence of adequate idiom vocabulary. It may also reflect difficulty in retrieving known idioms from memory and/or in selecting the most appropriate meaning from several possibilities in context. Despite relative weakness, the children with semantic-pragmatic difficulties displayed appropriate interpretations considerably more often than they evidenced inappropriate ones. Within-group analysis reveals that the children diagnosed with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism performed less well than did those diagnosed with 'semantic-pragmatic disorder'. Nevertheless, both of these subgroups encompassed a considerable range of comprehension ability with regard to the 12 common idioms tested. Analysis of the play task performance and symptom checklist suggests that this variation probably reflects differences in the critical semantic and pragmatic skills underpinning idiom comprehension. These include flexibility of thought, theory of mind, attention to context, prosody and overall coherence, as well as the ability to integrate world knowledge and current contextual information to guide inferencing. In combination with definition task data and broader knowledge of symptomatology, the play task may be used to identify the sites and sources of idiom comprehension breakdown in individual children. It is probable that idiom comprehension in this group of children with semantic-pragmatic difficulties was facilitated by the inclusion of only concrete idioms and by the visual support provided by the play set. Nevertheless, the moderate to age-appropriate ability displayed by this group in this context suggests that the characterization of children with semantic-pragmatic difficulties as predominantly literal needs to be revised. Rather than seeking a blanket characterization of an essentially heterogeneous group, it may be more useful to consider idiom comprehension a secondary manifestation of semantic and/or pragmatic difficulties. Since the children who exhibit these difficulties vary in symptomatology and, probably, in aetiology, it follows that they will also vary with respect to idiom comprehension and the reasons for its breakdown.

His response to vasopressin treatment suggested a concomitant presence of primary polydipsia. This is the first reported case of an autistic spectrum disorder associated with NDI or ES. The implications of the observed co-occurrence of these relatively rare disorders are discussed in relation to diagnosis and pathogenesis.

9615585		[Children with Asperger syndrome].	Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke	1998	G Bjørklund		"In 1994 Hans Asperger (1906-80), an Austrian physician, described a group of children with impaired social interaction and communication abilities. The name of this disorder today is Asperger's syndrome, and it is currently defined under the category of pervasive developmental disorder in DSM-IV and ICD-10. In this article the following aspects of Asperger's syndrome are focused on: personality, epidemiology, etiology, examination, differential diagnosis, management and prognosis. The article is based on a literature study. Asperger's syndrome seems to be considerably more common than ""classic"" autism. The syndrome is much more common in boys than in girls. The clinical characteristics of Asperger's syndrome are probably influenced by many factors, including organic and genetic factors. Asperger's syndrome is the term applied to the highest functioning end of the autism scale. There are several commonalities between Asperger's syndrome and autism, namely impairment of social interaction and communication abilities, and range of interests and activities. Differences exist primarily in the degree of impairment in language and cognitive development. Differential diagnosis, examination and management are discussed. There is a need for further research. It is important that the diagnostic criteria for Asperger's syndrome are as uniform as possible, and that they do not overlap with infantile autism."

9534114		Clumsiness in autism and Asperger syndrome: a further report.	Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	1998	M Ghaziuddin, E Butler		Clumsiness has been proposed as a diagnostic feature of Asperger syndrome (AS), a type of pervasive developmental disorder recently introduced in the ICD-10 and DSM-IV. However, the extent to which this symptom is specific to AS is not clear. To investigate this issue, we compared a sample of AS children with age- and sex-matched groups of children with autistic disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS). Twelve subjects with AS (ICD-10/DSM-IV; 11 males; average age 11.4 years; mean full-scale IQ 104.9) were compared with 12 subjects with autistic disorder (DSM-III-R; II males; average age 10.3 years; mean full-scale IQ 78.4) and 12 subjects with PDDNOS (DSM-III-R; 10 males; average age 10.1 years; mean full-scale IQ 78.2). The BruininksOseretsky test, a standardized test of motor coordination, was administered blind by the same investigator to all the three groups. While coordination deficits were found in all three groups, children with AS were found to be less impaired than those with autistic disorder and PDDNOS. However, no significant relationship was found between coordination scores and diagnosis after adjusting for the level of intelligence. These findings suggest that some patients with AS may be less clumsy than those with autistic disorder and that this difference may be the result of their higher level of intelligence. Studies based on larger samples using multiple measures of coordination are needed to further clarify the role of clumsiness in the classification of pervasive developmental disorders.

9517902		The long-term course of autistic disorders: update on follow-up studies.	Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica	1998	V Nordin, C Gillberg		The majority of children with autism show deviance and socially or psychiatrically handicapping conditions throughout life. Only a small proportion of those with classical childhood autism lead independent adult lives. Others, particularly those with 'high-functioning' autism and so-called Asperger syndrome will improve enough to live an independent adult life. The level of mental retardation and other comorbid conditions (such as medical syndromes and other neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy) is important in predicting outcome. An IQ below 50 around school age predicts severe restriction of social and adaptive functioning in adult life. The absence of communicative speech at 5-6 years of age is indicative of a poorer long-term overall outcome. There is a clear co-variation between IQ and level of communication, but probably there is some prognostic factor in language development apart from this. Measures of flexibility and cognitive shifting abilities tend to be good predictors of social outcome in a few studies. There is a continued need for prospective, longitudinal studies of children with autism spectrum disorders, particularly in Asperger syndrome. The role of interventions of various kinds needs to be addressed in such studies.
9472844		Sertraline in adults with pervasive developmental disorders: a prospective open-label investigation.	Journal of clinical psychopharmacology	1998	C J McDougle, E S Brodkin, S T Naylor, D C Carlson, D J Cohen, L H Price		The short-term efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for adults with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs) were assessed in this investigation. Forty-two adults with PDDs (autistic disorder, N = 22; Asperger's disorder, N = 6; and PDD not otherwise specified [NOS], N = 14) participated in a 12-week, open-label, systematic trial of sertraline. Behavioral ratings of repetitive symptoms, aggression, and social relatedness were obtained at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of sertraline administration. Twenty-four (57%) of 42 patients showed significant improvement, primarily in repetitive and aggressive symptoms. Statistically significant changes in measures of social relatedness did not occur. Patients with autistic disorder and PDD NOS did significantly better than those with Asperger's disorder. Based on global improvement item criteria from the Clinical Global Impression Scale, 15 of 22 (68%) patients with autistic disorder, none of six (0%) patients with Asperger's disorder, and 9 of 14 (64%) patients with PDD NOS were categorized as treatment responders. Sertraline was well tolerated; no adverse cardiovascular effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, or seizures were identified. These findings suggested that sertraline may be an effective treatment for interfering repetitive and aggressive symptoms in adults with PDDs. Definitive statements about the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline for treating adults with PDDs must await results from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. These preliminary results should not be generalized to include children and adolescents with PDDs.

In connection with the present study the original child psychiatric records were reassessed according to the ICD-10 criteria. The children were followed over a period of 30 years. The mean age at the time of study was 38 years. The results show that in adulthood the autistic patients had a poorer outcome than children with Asperger syndrome as regards education, employment, autonomy, marriage, reproduction and the need for continuing medical and institutional care. Particular attention is given to pharmacotherapy and the relationship between the childhood disorder and psychiatric morbidity in adult life.

Following several publications in the 1980s, for the disorder became more widely known and was first introduced into ICD-10 and DSM-IV as a new diagnosis in 1988 and 1994, respectively. The etiology is unknown. We present a female patient with typical features of Asperger syndrome, suffering also from epilepsy and internal medical disorders. The associated diseases, diagnostic criteria and possible therapeutic options are discussed.

9363580		Another advanced test of theory of mind: evidence from very high functioning adults with autism or asperger syndrome.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1997	S Baron-Cohen, T Jolliffe, C Mortimore, M Robertson		Previous studies have found a subgroup of people with autism or Asperger Syndrome who pass second-order tests of theory of mind. However, such tests have a ceiling in developmental terms corresponding to a mental age of about 6 years. It is therefore impossible to say if such individuals are intact or impaired in their theory of mind skills. We report the performance of very high functioning adults with autism or Asperger Syndrome on an adult test of theory of mind ability. The task involved inferring the mental state of a person just from the information in photographs of a person's eyes. Relative to age-matched normal controls and a clinical control group (adults with Tourette Syndrome), the group with autism and Asperger Syndrome were significantly impaired on this task. The autism and Asperger Syndrome sample was also impaired on Happé's strange stories tasks. In contrast, they were unimpaired on two control tasks: recognising gender from the eye region of the face, and recognising basic emotions from the whole face. This provides evidence for subtle mindreading deficits in very high functioning individuals on the autistic continuum.
9352732		Boys with Asperger's disorder, exceptional verbal intelligence, tics, and clumsiness.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	1997	R Nass, R Gutman		Five boys with both Asperger's disorder and Tourette syndrome, exceptional verbal intelligence, and clumsiness are reported. Each presented at early elementary school age with a prominent complaint of social difficulties with peers. History was notable for a flapping stereotypy and the neurological examination revealed motor and/or vocal tics and numerous motor soft signs. Highly specialized interests were characteristics. Language prosody and/or pragmatics was impaired. Despite exceptional verbal intelligence, the children were not, according to their teachers and parents, faring well either socially or academically. Motor difficulties, manifested psychometrically as a significant performance IQ disadvantage, interfered with school performance and social adjustment. Tics, although not noted by parents in the clinical history, compounded their social difficulties. Asperger's disorder in these highly verbal children overlaps with pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) on account of the socioemotional difficulties and stereotypies seen in both. Asperger's disorder and Tourette syndrome overlap in these children on account of the tics. Finally, Asperger's disorder and the right-hemisphere-based learning disorders overlap on account of the visuoperceptual and attentional deficits that can occur in both.
9344050		Attention deficits and autistic spectrum problems in children exposed to alcohol during gestation: a follow-up study.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	1997	M Aronson, B Hagberg, C Gillberg		Children born to mothers who had abused alcohol throughout pregnancy had severe behavioural and intellectual problems which remained at age 11 to 14 years. Of 24 children examined, 10 had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with or without developmental coordination disorder, two had Asperger syndrome, and one had an autistic-like condition not meeting the criteria for Asperger syndrome. Six of these 24 attended special schools for the mentally retarded and a further 11 were given special education, leaving only seven attending regular schools without any type of support. The children had difficulties in mathematics, logical conclusions, visual perception, spatial relations, short-term memory, and attention. Sixteen children lived in foster homes. There was a clear correlation between the occurrence and severity of the neuropsychiatric disorder and the degree of alcohol exposure in utero.
9300193		Autism and Asperger's syndrome.	Current opinion in pediatrics	1997	K E Towbin	Department of Psychiatry, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC 20010, USA.	"Knowledge about the spectrum of autistic disorders, including Asperger's syndrome, has grown significantly. Diagnoses can be made more reliably and there is better characterization of elements within the spectrum than ever before. A clearer picture of the cognitive limitations displayed by persons with conditions in the autistic spectrum is emerging. Deficits in manipulating abstract meanings, translating principles across contexts, and attending to contextual meanings can be seen in lower and higher functioning individuals. Links between ""executive function,"" ""theory of mind,"" and findings from functional imaging are becoming apparent. There are consistent indications that frontal and temporal regions play a crucial role in these disorders. Associations with specific genetic defects has been suggested, but methods capable of discovering the complex interplay of several genes will be needed before generalized conclusions can be reached."

Journal of cognitive neuroscience	1997	S Baron-Cohen, J Hammer		"Two cognitive anomalies have been found in autism: a superiority on the Embedded Figures Task and a deficit in ""theory of mind."" Using adult-level versions of these tasks, the present study investigated if parents of children with Asperger Syndrome might show a mild variant of these anomalies, as might be predicted from a genetic hypothesis. Significant differences were found on both measures. Parents were significantly faster than controls on the Embedded Figures Task and slightly but significantly less accurate at interpreting photographs of the eye region of the face in terms of mental states. The results are discussed in terms of the broader cognitive phenotype of Asperger Syndrome and in terms of their implications for cognitive neuroscientific theories of the condition."
9334896		Clomipramine in adults with pervasive developmental disorders: a prospective open-label investigation.	Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology	1997	E S Brodkin, C J McDougle, S T Naylor, D J Cohen, L H Price		"The purpose of this investigation was to determine the short-term efficacy and tolerability of clomipramine in a consecutive series of adults with pervasive developmental disorders (PDDs). Thirty-five adults with PDDs (DSM-IV), 16 of whom were nonverbal, entered a 12-week prospective open-label trial of clomipramine. The initial sample included 18 patients with autistic disorder, 6 patients with Asperger's disorder, and 11 patients with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDDNOS). Behavioral ratings were obtained at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of clomipramine. Eighteen (55%) of the 33 patients who completed the trial were categorized as treatment responders based on scores of ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) global improvement item (p < 0.001). Ten (63%) of 16 patients with autistic disorder, 2 (33%) of 6 patients with Asperger's disorder, and 6 (55%) of 11 patients with PDDNOS were considered responders to clomipramine treatment. In those 18 patients, clomipramine significantly reduced total repetitive thoughts and behavior (p < 0.001) and also aggression (p < 0.001), and improved some aspects of social relatedness, such as eye contact and verbal responsiveness (p < 0.001). Change in these specific symptom clusters over time was not related to DSM-IV subtype of PDD. The level of autistic behavior, as measured by the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) score, and full-scale intelligence quotient (IQ) were not significantly associated with global treatment response. Whereas clomipramine was well tolerated by most patients, 13 had clinically significant adverse effects. Three patients had seizures during clomipramine treatment, including 2 who had prior seizure disorders and were taking anticonvulsants. Of the 32 patients who had no history of prior seizures, only 1 had a seizure during clomipramine treatment. There were no adverse cardiovascular or extrapyramidal effects. All responders continued on clomipramine after completion of the study. The results of this open-label trial suggest that clomipramine may be an effective drug for reducing repetitive thoughts and actions and aggressive behavior and for improving some elements of social behavior, such as eye contact and verbal responsivity in adults with PDDs. Careful monitoring of adverse effects, particularly seizures, is warranted. Although an electroencephalogram (EEG) is not mandatory in patients with PDD prior to clomipramine treatment, we recommend that patients with PDD and a history of seizures be treated initially with a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor rather than with clomipramine. The findings of this study require replication in a double-blind placebo-controlled investigation before definitive statements of efficacy and tolerability can be made."
9259226		Low body weight in male children and adolescents with schizoid personality disorder or Asperger's disorder.	Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica	1997	J Hebebrand, K Henninghausen, S Nau, G W Himmelmann, E Schulz, H Schäfer, H Remschmidt		This study explored the hypothesis that body weight is reduced in male children and adolescents with schizoid personality disorder or Asperger's disorder. The body weights of 33 consecutively admitted male subjects with one of these disorders were retrospectively assessed with percentiles for the body mass index (BMI). The mean percentile (+/- SD) for the BMI was 31.6 +/- 27.6 and differed significantly from the expected value of 50 (P<0.001). Ten subjects had a BMI of < or = 10th age percentile. Post hoc comparisons revealed that BMI percentiles were (a) reduced to a similar extent in patients with schizoid personality disorder and Asperger's disorder and (b) reduced to a greater extent in patients with abnormal eating behaviour. During childhood and adolescence both diagnoses are associated with an increased risk of being underweight. Population-based BMI percentiles are useful for detecting associations between specific psychopathological syndromes and body weight.
9255696		Are people with autism and Asperger syndrome faster than normal on the Embedded Figures Test?	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1997	T Jolliffe, S Baron-Cohen		"Previous work suggests children with autism show superior performance (in relation to their general mental age) on the Embedded Figures Test (EFT). Frith interprets this as showing that they have ""weak central coherence"". In Experiment 1, using an adult level version of this task, we aimed to replicate and extend this finding, first, by collecting response time (RT) data; second, by testing adults with autism of normal intelligence; and third, by testing a group of adults with Asperger syndrome, in order to test for differences between autism and Asperger syndrome. Both clinical groups were significantly faster on the EFT. In Experiment 2, we investigated if this difference was due to a preference for local over global processing, using a novel drawing task based on the classical Rey Figure. The clinical groups did not differ significantly on this test, but there was a trend towards such a difference. Alternative explanations for the EFT superiority in autism and Asperger syndrome are considered."

9141143		A comparative study of Asperger syndrome with high-functioning atypical autism.	Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences	1997	H Kurita	Department of Mental Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.	To test the validity of Asperger syndrome (AS) as defined in ICD-10, 26 patients (age range, 3.5 to 12 years) with AS and 16 patients (age range, 3 to 11.5 years) with high-functioning (IQ > 90) ICD-10 atypical autism (HAA) were compared on 64 clinical variables including obstetric risk factors, early developmental landmarks, IQ, autistic symptoms on the CARS-TV, epileptic EEG abnormalities and epilepsy. AS did not differ significantly from HAA on all but total and four item scores (i.e. imitation, visual responsiveness, auditory responsiveness and non-verbal communication) on the CARS-TV, in which AS scored significantly lower than HAA. A discriminant function based on imitation and auditory responsiveness predicted 76.2% of the 42 cases. The small difference from HAA indicates that AS is better to be regarded as the highest-functioning end of the PDD spectrum, rather than a valid subtype of PDD. However, the autistic symptom profile less distorted in AS than HAA may warrant a further study on its validity.

Social science & medicine (1982)	1997	D E Gray	Department of Sociology, University of New England, Armidale, NSW, Australia.	This study examines the social construction of normal family life among the parents of children with high functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. The meaning of the concept of normal family life is reviewed, and a constructionist perspective is employed to understand the parents' evaluations of their families. The results present a description of the factors used as evidence for or against family normality and the variations in such perceptions according to the gender of the parent and the child's autistic symptoms.
9232470		Did Asperger's cases have Asperger disorder? A research note.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1997	J N Miller, S Ozonoff		With publication of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM-IV), standardized criteria for Asperger Disorder, a putative subtype of Pervasive Developmental Disorder, are now available. This paper examines the four cases Asperger originally presented in his seminal paper (1991/1994), using DSM-IV criteria to determine whether a diagnosis of Autistic or Asperger Disorder is most appropriate. We found that all four cases met DSM-IV criteria for Autistic Disorder, rather than Asperger Disorder. This suggests that the syndrome Asperger originally described may not be captured by present diagnostic criteria. Implications for future research are discussed.
9232467		Asperger syndrome, autism and attention disorders: a comparative study of the cognitive profiles of 120 children.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1997	S Ehlers, A Nydén, C Gillberg, A D Sandberg, S O Dahlgren, E Hjelmquist, A Odén		"The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) was applied (in a Swedish version) in 120 children with Asperger syndrome, autistic disorder, and attention disorders. Using stepwise logistic regression analysis, the WISC's discriminating ability was investigated. The overall rate of correct diagnostic classification was 63%. Further, WISC profiles were analysed within each group. The group with autistic disorder was characterised by a peak on Block Design. The Asperger syndrome group had good verbal ability and troughs on Object Assembly and Coding. The group with attention disorders had troughs on Coding and Arithmetic. The results suggest that Kaufman's Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organisation and Freedom from Distractibility factors rather than verbal IQ and performance IQ account for the variance on the WISC. Furthermore, the Asperger syndrome and autistic disorder groups differed in respect of ""fluid"" and ""crystallised"" cognitive ability."

Korsakova	1997	V M Bashina, I A Kozlova, T P Kliushnik, N V Simashkova, E V Danilovskaia, N L Gorbachevskaia, I L Turkova, L P Iakupova, V V Grachev		The level of autoantibodies (AAB) to nerve growth factor (NGF) was examined in blood of mentally healthy children, children with early children schizophrenia as well as with Kanner's and Asperger's syndromes too. The elevated titer of AAB to NGF was determined in blood of children with acute, active state of disease; meanwhile the same titer wasn't changed in the state of stable remission or steady defective state as compared with control group. The correlation was found between the level of AAB to NGF and the degree of disease progression. The correlations which were revealed between AAB to NGF level and peculiarities of the clinical state of patients permitted to use this index as the objective marker of both the acuteness and the severity of the patient's state.

Following several publications in the ""80's, the disorder became more widely known. Asperger syndrome was introduced into ICD-10 and DSM-IV as a new diagnosis in 1988 and 1994, respectively. Several authors developed own criteria. Until now, some of the diagnostic criteria of Asperger syndrome remain controversial.

8981378		Asperger's syndrome and memory: similarity to autism but not amnesia.	Neuropsychologia	1997	D M Bowler, N J Matthews, J M Gardiner		Two experiments are described in which the memory of adults with Asperger's syndrome is compared with that of verbal IQ controls. The results of the first experiment showed that the Asperger subjects resembled autistic adults and children in their failure to use category information to aid their free recall. In the second experiment, both groups of subjects showed similar priming effects in an implicit stem completion task and similar performance on an explicit cued recall task. Moreover, both groups also showed more priming for items that they had read at study and better recall for items that they had to generate at study, suggesting that the cued recall of the Asperger subjects did not result from contamination by automatic or involuntary processes.
9051780		'Theory of mind' in the brain. Evidence from a PET scan study of Asperger syndrome.	Neuroreport	1996	F Happé, S Ehlers, P Fletcher, U Frith, M Johansson, C Gillberg, R Dolan, R Frackowiak, C Frith		The ability to attribute mental states to others ('theory of mind') pervades normal social interaction and is impaired in autistic individuals. In a previous positron emission tomography scan study of normal volunteers, performing a 'theory of mind' task was associated with activity in left medial prefrontal cortex. We used the same paradigm in five patients with Asperger syndrome, a mild variant of autism with normal intellectual functioning. No task-related activity was found in this region, but normal activity was observed in immediately adjacent areas. This result suggests that a highly circumscribed region of left medial prefrontal cortex is a crucial component of the brain system that underlies the normal understanding of other minds.
8989556		The effect of selection criteria on outcome studies of children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD).	European child & adolescent psychiatry	1996	P Szatmari, D L Streiner		The objective of this paper is to see whether regression to the mean biases the differences on outcome observed between children with Asperger syndrome and autism. Children with pervasive developmental disorders (PDD) and normal nonverbal IQ were divided into those with Asperger syndrome and autism. It was hypothesized that IQ in the autistic children would fall at the 2-year outcome assessments since the autistic group represented a subgroup selected on the basis of extreme scores on a single measure. In fact, the Asperger syndrome group experienced a significant drop in nonverbal IQ contrary to expectation. Serial measurements of nonverbal IQ at inception indicated that this drop was probably a function of high initial nonverbal IQ scores that fall over time due to increasing complexity of problem-solving tests. The results are discussed in relation to outcome studies of high functioning children with PDD.
8986845		Pedantic speaking style differentiates Asperger syndrome from high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1996	M Ghaziuddin, L Gerstein		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder recently introduced as a new diagnostic category in the ICD-10 and the DSM-IV. Along with motor clumsiness, pedantic speech has been proposed as a clinical feature of AS. However, few attempts have been made to define and measure this symptom. We studied 17 patients with AS (ICD-10; 14 male, 3 female; mean age 16.4 years, mean full-scale IQ 97) and compared them with a control group of 13 patients with normal-intelligence autism or high-functioning autism (HFA) (ICD-10/DSM-III-R; 12 male, 1 female; mean age 15.5 years, mean full-scale IQ 81.2). An operational definition of pedantic speech was formulated and a rating scale devised. 13 (76%) of the AS patients were rated as pedantic compared to 4 (31%) of the HFA group (chi 2 = 6.3; p = .01). Results suggest that pedantic speech is common in AS and may help differentiate AS from high-functioning autism.

8951804		Autism, Asperger's syndrome and the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of REM sleep.	Medical hypotheses	1996	D W Brown		Autism, Asperger's syndrome and other autistic syndromes are developmental brain disorders that cause serious impairments in communication, social interaction, empathy, mood and play. In addition to such deficits, the autistic syndromes involve pathologically high levels of repetitive, stereotypic, ritualistic, compulsive or obsessive behavior, together with extreme resistance to change. According to the Crick-Mitchison theory of the biological function of rapid eye movement sleep, normal brain development in the fetus and infant depends on undisrupted function of a 'reverse learning' mechanism during rapid eye movement sleep. Could abnormalities in this hypothetical reverse learning during rapid eye movement sleep in the fetus explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes? Does the Crick-Mitchison theory suggest if a drug could interfere with rapid eye movement sleep and cross the placental barrier, then that drug might cause developmental brain disorders in the fetus? Should all pregnant women completely avoid caffeine or any agent that might disrupt serotonergic or cholinergic systems?

8894958		Theory of mind in non-retarded children with autism and Asperger's syndrome. A research note.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1996	S O Dahlgren, A Trillingsgaard		In the present study, 20 non-retarded children with autism and 20 non-retarded children with Asperger's syndrome, individually matched to the group of children with autism, participated. No statistically significant differences between the groups were found in the theory of mind tasks. In fact, the two groups performed almost as well as a group of normal children. These findings suggest that the theory of mind model has its limitations in explaining autism and that children with Asperger's syndrome are not more competent in theory of mind tasks than children with autism within the normal range of intelligence.
8878325		A savant poet.	Psychological medicine	1996	A Dowker, B Hermelin, L Pring		Poems by an individual with a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome were analysed and compared with those of a comparison poet. Though the savant poet performed less efficiently on formal language tests supposed to tap creativity, there were few differences between the two poets in regard to the poems' content and the use of various structural devices. The poems by the savant referred more often to aspects of self-analysis, while descriptions of people not related to the self were less frequent. Both poets made use of similes and metaphors. The results are discussed in terms of different modular domains within the language system.

Journal of neuro-ophthalmology : the official journal of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society	1996	M C Brodsky, L G Barber, B L Lam, L M Merin, S Edelson		Asperger disorder is a complex behavioral disorder that may be related to autism. We examined a 49-year-old man with Asperger disorder who had multiple neuro-ophthalmologic abnormalities, including colobomatous defects involving the optic discs and peripapillary retina, and abnormal ocular motility with an oculocephalic dyskinesia. Asperger disorder may be associated with a variety of neuro-ophthalmologic disturbances.
8810716		Asperger syndrome associated with Steinert's myotonic dystrophy.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	1996	T A Blondis, E Cook, P Koza-Taylor, T Finn		Steinert's myotonic dystrophy was diagnosed in a 10-year-old girl with Asperger syndrome. This form of myotonic dystrophy is one of a growing list of genetic diseases that can be diagnosed by analysis of a gene with trinucleotide repeats that may expand. The patient has the largest such expansion known within her pedigree. She has many of the psychological deficits that have been reported in adult-onset myotonic dystrophy. This is the first known report of an association of this disorder with Asperger syndrome. Recently Moebius syndrome has been found in association with disorders of the autistic spectrum; physicians practicing developmental medicine should now also consider Steinert's myotonic dystrophy when evaluating children with facial diplegia.
8814412		Early detection of autism. Diagnostic instruments for clinicians.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	1996	C Gillberg, V Nordin, S Ehlers		Autism and Asperger syndrome are disorders with early childhood onset. They are believed to exist on the same spectrum of impairments of reciprocal communication and social interaction restriction of imagination and behaviour. A number of screening and diagnostic tools have been developed in the field, and several of these are briefly reviewed here. It is concluded that autism may be screened around age 18 months and a diagnosis reliably be made around age 30 months, whereas a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome is not usually suspected, screened or made until into the child's school age.
8792266		The long-term effects of auditory training on children with autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1996	S Bettison	Autism Research Institute, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.	Eighty children, 3-17 years of age, with autism or Asperger syndrome and mild to severe distress in the presence of some sounds, were randomly allocated to two groups. The experimental group received auditory training and the control group listened to the same unmodified music under the same conditions. Significant improvements in behavior and severity of autism were maintained for 12 months by both groups. Informal data suggested that a range of abnormal responses to sound and other sensory abnormalities may also have improved. Verbal and performance IQ increased significantly 3 to 12 months after interventions. Findings suggest that some aspect of both auditory training and listening to selected unmodified music may have a beneficial effect on children with autism and sound sensitivity, and indicate a need for further research into the effects that led to these changes and the mechanisms involved in the sensory abnormalities commonly associated with autism.
8771711		Cytochromes P450 of the sophorose lipid-producing yeast Candida apicola: heterogeneity and polymerase chain reaction-mediated cloning of two genes.	Yeast (Chichester, England)	1996	K Lottermoser, W H Schunck, O Asperger		Candida apicola belongs to a group of yeasts producing high amounts of surface-active extracellular glycolipids consisting of sophorose and long-chain-omega- and (omega-1)-hydroxy fatty acids. The involvement of cytochrome P450 in the synthesis of sophorose lipid by the hydroxylation of long-chain fatty acids was suggested from a simultaneous increase of cellular P450 content. Hydroxylation studies indicated the existence of multiple P450 forms capable of hydroxylating not only long-chain fatty acids, but also n-alkanes. In this report, two different P450 DNA fragments amplified in a polymerase chain reaction with heterologous primers and chromosomal DNA of Candida apicola were used as homologous probes for the isolation of full-length clones from a genomic library. The open reading frames of both genes encode proteins of 519 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 58,656 and 58,631, respectively, that contain N-terminal membrane anchor sequences and hallmark residues, in common with other eukaryotic P450s. The deduced amino acid sequences of the C. apicola P450 genes are 84.4% identical. They share 34.5 to 44.1% identity with the proteins of the yeast family CYP52 and about 25% identity with fatty acid hydroxylases of higher eukaryotes (family CYP4A) and of Bacillus megaterium (CYP102). Southern hybridization experiments revealed the existence of further P450-related genes in C. apicola. According to the P450 nomenclature system, the cloned genes were named CYP52E1 and CYP52E2, establishing a new subfamily in yeast family CYP52.

Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	1996	I C Gillberg, C Gillberg		In a population study, 55 children aged 13 years and under were diagnosed as suffering from autistic disorder according to DSM-III-R criteria. Fifteen of these children (27%) were born to parents, at least one of whom had migrated to Sweden. These 15 cases were analysed in some detail with a view to finding possible background factors that could account for the relatively high prevalence of autism among some immigrant populations. In a few cases, autism or Asperger syndrome had been diagnosed in a native Swedish parent who went abroad in order to find a spouse. In several other cases, the child was the first child born in Sweden after the mother had moved there. The contribution of genetic and other prenatal factors to autism in immigrant populations is discussed.

9059572		Language and pragmatic functions in school-age children on the autism spectrum.	European journal of disorders of communication : the journal of the College of Speech and Language Therapists, London	1996	C Ramberg, S Ehlers, A Nydén, M Johansson, C Gillberg		This study examined group differences in language and pragmatic functions across sex-, age- and IQ-matched samples of Asperger syndrome (N = 22), high-functioning autism (N = 11), deficits in attention, motor control and perception (DAMP) (N = 11), and speech and language disorder (SLD) (N = 11) groups. The purpose was to explore possible differentiating features in the fields of vocabulary, comprehension and pragmatics and, in addition, to determine whether Asperger syndrome could be reliably separated from high-functioning autism on these variables. The findings suggest that Asperger syndrome may be associated with higher full-scale and verbal IQ than high-functioning autism; Asperger syndrome may not be associated with better pragmatic skills (as defined in this context) than high-functioning autism; language comprehension may not clearly separate Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism once the effects of very low IQ are partialled out; both DAMP and SLD can be distinctly separated from Asperger syndrome and autism.
8770522		The cognitive profile of anorexia nervosa: a comparative study including a community-based sample.	Comprehensive psychiatry	1996	I C Gillberg, C Gillberg, M Råstam, M Johansson		A community-based sample of adolescent-onset anorexia nervosa (AN) cases (n = 51) was contrasted with an age-, sex-, and school-matched comparison group [comp] (n = 51) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) at a mean age of 21 years. There were no study dropouts. Fewer than 10% of AN cases were underweight at the time of testing. Overall, there were few differences across the two groups, even though the COMP group performed significantly better on the object assembly subtest. A small subgroup of AN cases showed autism-spectrum disorders. This subgroup tended toward test profiles similar to those observed in autism and Asperger syndrome. These findings are discussed in relation to the clinical need for subgrouping of AN cases with a view to improving treatment programs/interviews.
8567603		Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry	1996	F R Volkmar, A Klin, R Schultz, R Bronen, W D Marans, S Sparrow, D J Cohen		This Grand Rounds is concerned with the classification of Asperger's syndrome and its continuity/discontinuity with autism. Information on a 15-year-old with the condition is presented as are data on other family members. The proband exhibited a longstanding pattern of marked deficits in social interaction, motor awkwardness, and unusual, circumscribed interest consistent with a diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome. Both the proband and his father exhibited unusual discrepancies between verbal and performance (nonverbal) cognitive abilities favoring the former. Deficits were observed in the social use of language. Father and son had similar abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging examination. Potential differences between higher-functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome are important areas for future research.
8781638		Asperger's syndrome: a report of two cases from Malaysia.	Singapore medical journal	1995	K Kasmini, S Zasmani		Asperger's Syndrome is a distinct variant of autism, with a prevalence rate of 10 to 26 per 10,000 of normal intelligence, and 0.4 per 10,000 in those with mild mental retardation. The syndrome now has its own clinical entity and diagnostic criteria. It is being officially listed in the ICD-10 under pervasive developmental disorder. Two such cases are described in this article. Case One lacked the ability to relate to others, was excessively preoccupied with the late actor P. Ramlee and demonstrated a peculiar behaviour of holding on to toothbrushes in his early childhood. Cognitively, he was unable to synthesise words into meaningful sentences. Similarly, Case Two was unable to relate well to others and was preoccupied with the planets and its constellations. Though he appeared intelligent with an IQ score of 101, he was unable to follow instructions at school. Both children had motor clumsiness and fulfilled the criteria for the diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome.
8746742		Obstetric factors in Asperger syndrome: comparison with high-functioning autism.	Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	1995	M Ghaziuddin, J Shakal, L Tsai		Asperger syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder widely regarded as a mild variant of autism. To investigate if AS is associated with a history of fewer obstetric insults compared to autism, we examined the developmental history and obstetric records of 10 males with AS (mean full scale IQ 95.3), and compared them with 10 autistic males with a full scale IQ of 70 or above (so-called high-functioning autism; mean full scale IQ 82.6). Males with AS showed a trend toward lower Apgar scores at one minute (chi-square = 4; df = 1; P = 0.04) and were more likely to have been born to mothers outside the optimal age group of 20-30 years (chi-square = 5; df = 1; P = 0.02). They were also less likely to have been irritable and floppy as infants (chi-square = 3.8; df = 1; P = 0.05). However, the total optimality scores did not differ significantly between the two groups.

8847376		Validity and neuropsychological characterization of Asperger syndrome: convergence with nonverbal learning disabilities syndrome.	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1995	A Klin, F R Volkmar, S S Sparrow, D V Cicchetti, B P Rourke		The authors investigated the validity of Asperger Syndrome (AS) by comparing the neuropsychological profiles in this condition and Higher-Functioning Autism (HFA). Diagnostic assignment followed a stringent procedure based on ICD-10 research criteria for the two disorders. The groups had comparable age and Full Scale IQ distributions. The groups differed significantly in 11 neuropsychological areas. The profile obtained for individuals with AS coincided closely with a cluster of neuropsychological assets and deficits captured by the term nonverbal learning disabilities, suggesting an empirical distinction from HFA.

24283631	doi: 10.1111/j.1468-1331.1995.tb00110.x	The neurology of autism: many unanswered questions.	European journal of neurology	1995	I Rapin, M Dunn		Autism is a behaviorally defined developmental disorder of the brain almost always presenting in infancy or the preschool years. Its symptoms persist life-long, although partial compensation is possible through targeted special education that addresses children's deficits in sociability, verbal and non-verbal communication, and atypical range of interests, activities, and cognitive skills. Although a majority of autistic individuals are mentally deficient, IQ is not a defining feature and verbal autistic persons of normal intelligence are increasingly being identified, referred to as Asperger syndrome. Meager neuropathologic data have disclosed subtle prenatal cellular limbic and cerebellar abnormalities. Autism is associated with a variety of defined genetic and acquired conditions, with multifactorial genetic traits, alone or interacting with environmental events, presumably responsible for most unexplained cases. Autistic regression is frequent and poorly understood and may be associated with clinical or subclinical epilepsy. Unravelling the neurobiologic basis of a disorder that may affect 1-2 in 1000 children will require a concerted multidisciplinary attack.
7594267		Right-hemisphere dysfunction in Asperger's syndrome.	Journal of child neurology	1995	J R McKelvey, R Lambert, L Mottron, M I Shevell		Asperger's syndrome has many clinical features in common with acquired right-hemisphere dysfunction and has been postulated to result from a developmental abnormality of the right hemisphere. However, right-hemisphere abnormality has not previously been documented on neuroanatomic or functional imaging in patients with Asperger's syndrome. We report three patients with Asperger's syndrome found to have abnormal right-hemisphere function on single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging. The subjects were two males and one female, ranging from 12 to 16 years of age. All were diagnosed on the basis of the presence of the complete constellation of clinical features previously outlined. All patients were investigated with computed tomographic (CT) scanning, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and SPECT scanning. In one subject, CT and MRI revealed enlargement of the right lateral ventricle, reflecting a mild degree of right hemispheric atrophy. CT and MRI studies on the other two subjects were normal. SPECT scanning demonstrated right hemispheric abnormalities in each subject: right temporal hypoperfusion with a central area of increased perfusion along with frontal polar hyperperfusion in one; diffusely decreased right hemispheric uptake in the second; and decreased frontal and occipital uptake in the third. Cerebellar abnormalities were also present: a smaller right hemisphere with increased uptake in the first; decreased uptake in the vermis and right hemisphere in the second; and decreased vermal uptake in the third. These findings support the hypothesis that the neurobiologic basis of Asperger's syndrome is a developmental abnormality of the right cerebral hemisphere.
7559846		Schizoid personality in girls: a follow-up study--what are the links with Asperger's syndrome?	Journal of child psychology and psychiatry, and allied disciplines	1995	S Wolff, R J McGuire		"Child psychiatric records of 33 girls given a diagnosis of ""schizoid"" personality in childhood, were compared with records of a control group of other referred girls and with those of 32 pairs of ""schizoid"" and control boys. Seventeen ""schizoid"" girls were seen again in adult life and compared with 32 ""schizoid"" boys previously followed up at the same age. The features of ""schizoid"" girls in childhood and adult life were very similar to those of the boys. A striking finding, possible due to referral bias, was the high rate of antisocial conduct in ""schizoid"" girls, both in childhood and later life. The dilemmas of diagnostic classification of this group of patients are discussed."

7559296		Brief report: thought disorder in Asperger syndrome: comparison with high-functioning autism.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1995	M Ghaziuddin, L Leininger, L Tsai		"Asperger syndrome (AS) is a pervasive developmental disorder generally regarded as a variant of autism. While it has been included in the ICD-10 and DSM-IV as a distinct diagnostic entity, it is still unclear to what extent it differs from high-functioning autism (HFA). Persons with HFA have been reported to show a variety of deficits of thought processes. Abnormalities such as poor reality testing, perceptual distortions, and areas of cognitive slippage have been described using the Rorschach inkblot test (Dykens, Volkmar, & Glick, 1991). Since AS has been conceptualized as a mild variant of autism, we hypothesized that persons with AS will have fewer abnormalities on the Rorschach test compared to persons with HFA. To test this hypothesis, we compared 12 subjects with AS (ICD-10, 10 male, mean age = 12.2 +/- 3.3 years, mean full-scale IQ = 99.6) with 8 subjects with HFA (ICD-10/DSM-III-R, 7 male, mean age = 12.2 +/- 3.8 years, mean full-scale IQ = 83.4) on the Rorschach test. AS subjects demonstrated a trend towards greater levels of disorganized thinking than the HFA group. They were also more likely to be classified as ""Introversive"" suggesting that AS subjects may have more complex inner lives involving elaborate fantasies, Also, AS subjects tended to be more focused on their internal experiences. However, overall, the Rorschach test was not found to differentiate the two diagnostic groups on the majority of structural variables. Implications of these findings are discussed with regard to the diagnostic validity of Asperger syndrome."

7608032		Comparison of Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autistic children on a test of motor impairment.	Journal of autism and developmental disorders	1995	J Manjiviona, M Prior		Compared the motor impairment levels of Asperger syndrome and high functioning autistic children using a standardized test, the Test of Motor Impairment-Henderson Revision. The two groups did not differ on either total or subscale impairment scores. Intelligence level was negatively correlated with motor impairment although the relationship was mostly accounted for by the Asperger children. There was considerable variability within both clinical groups but 50% of Asperger children and 67% of autistic children showed a clinically significant level of motor impairment. Results offer no support for clumsiness as a diagnostically differentiating feature of these disorders.

29871460	doi: 10.1007/BF01978114	A preliminary study of right hemisphere cognitive deficits and impaired social judgments among young people with Asperger syndrome.	European child & adolescent psychiatry	1994	Hadyn D Ellis, Diane M Ellis, William Fraser, Shoumitro Deb	Department of Psychological Medicine, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK. School of Psychology, University of Wales, Cardiff, UK. School of Education, University of Wales, Cardiff, UK.	"Seven children and young adults with definite signs of Asperger syndrome were administered a battery of tests designed to test: intelligence; left and right cerebral hemisphere functioning; ability to discriminate eye gaze; and social judgment. The subjects revealed a non significant tendency to have a higher verbal IQ than visual IQ; and their right hemisphere functioning seemed impaired. They were also poorer at discriminating eye gaze and revealed difficulties in making hypothetical social judgments. The data are considered with reference to Rourke's (1988) work on non-verbal learning disabilities together with the ideas of Tantam (1992) on the ""social gaze response"" and Baron-Cohen's (1993) Eye-Detection Detector model. The possible links between social judgment and theory of mind (Frith, 1991) are briefly explored."
7926319		Developmental prosopagnosia in Asperger syndrome: presentation and discussion of an individual case.	Developmental medicine and child neurology	1994	I Kracke	Department of Psychology, Hollymoor Hospital, Birmingham.	The case of a young man is presented who initially appeared to be quite normal and very intelligent, if somewhat immature. Profound prosopagnosia was discovered in the course of a psychological assessment. Closer investigation revealed definite autistic features of the Asperger type, and both conditions ran in the family in a milder form. Questions arising from observations and experiments as well as from the case history are discussed, and an attempt is made to elucidate some problems in the light of the original theories about these conditions. It is suggested that prosopagnosia may be an essential symptom in one of the autism spectrum disorders, perhaps of a specific subgroup of Asperger syndrome. Visual hypo-emotionality is suggested as a possible common denominator of the two conditions.
7841689		Is clumsiness a marker for Asperger syndrome?	Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR	1994	M Ghaziuddin, E Butler, L Tsai, N Ghaziuddin		Although Asperger syndrome (AS) has been included in the ICD-10 as a distinct category within the pervasive developmental disorders, it is still unclear to what extent it differs from normal-intelligence autism (high-functioning autism; HFA). Persons with AS are said to be particularly clumsy. To test the hypothesis that clumsiness can reliably distinguish AS from autism, the present authors compared 11 patients with AS (ICD-10; 10 males; mean age, 13.6 years; mean IQ, 98) with nine patients with HFA (ICD-10/DSM-III-R; eight males; mean age, 12.9 years; mean IQ, 84). Clumsiness was assessed by the Bruininks-Oseretsky test. Both groups showed problems with coordination and the distribution of standard scores was virtually identical. This suggests that motor clumsiness, as measured by tests of coordination, may not reliably distinguish AS from HFA. However, qualitative differences may occur between the two groups in the manner in which movements are performed. Further research with larger samples may elicit differences into the pattern of motor deficits that occur in autism and AS.
